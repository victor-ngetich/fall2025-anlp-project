Read the prepared statement
and ask for questions.

And expect Hanrady to ask about
the Wilky Gardens bust.

- Deflect, but don't deny.
- Right. You got your notes?

Don't need them.

Thanks for making the trip, fellas.
Now here's Captain David Aceveda.

Thank you, Wanda.

The Farmington District
of Los Angeles...

...which I've been commanding...

...for the last four months,
has traditionally been...

...one of the most crime-ridden areas
of the city.

Some reporters have gone so far
as to label Farmington a war zone.




Oh, shit. Go. Go.

I'm proud to announce that murders,
rapes, armed robberies...

...and other violent crimes
have decreased...

...in this district in the last 6 months.

Under my direction, officers...

...now participate in neighborhood
outreach programs.

The effect is being
felt by local families.

Mothers feel safer
as they shop for groceries.

Too late, G-man.

With the continued support
of community leaders and citizens...

...we can make the Farmington District
a safer home for all of us.

Mother...

- That's for running, asshole.
- Shit.

Get up.




What the hell, man?

Hey, look at that, Booty.

Looks like you got some kind of
third nad growing down there.

- Let me get that for you.
- No way. Shit! Shit!

- I got an evidence bag here, boss.
- No, it's okay. I got it.

All right.

Come on, come on.

Any questions?

Christ, you do not see
a pair like that every day.

- It's called rigor.
- Rigor or no rigor, that's quite a rack.

You wanna give them a squeeze?

How much time we got
before the ME shows up?

Victim's sister's outside.
Wants to know what happened.

Dutch is in charge
of all potential criers.

- Thanks. You the first one here?
- Yeah, me and Julien got the call.

Last few weeks, dead bodies
seem to follow you around.

Yeah, I'm a real fun-time gal.
Any notions on this one?

Nature of the wounds, we're looking
at an inexperienced underachiever.

Covering up the genitals
says he was ashamed.

Family member, boyfriend.
He's gonna break easy.

- No. Let me go! Goddamn it! Get off...
- Miss! Miss, I need you to calm down.

- Who are you?
- Detective Wagenbach.

- Is she dead?
- There's a woman inside.

- We haven't determined her identity.
- This is my sister's place.

Like I said, we don't
know who she is yet.

Long blond hair, pretty.

That sounds like her. I'm sorry.

Ma'am.

Ma'am?

- She's blowing him.
- Check it out.

- Where's Jenny?
- Jenny?

Nancy's little girl. Where is she?

Come with me.

Guess what's missing.

- Oh, shit, son.
- I know. It just got interesting.

Hey, sarge.

Thanks.

I gotta hit the head.
I'll see you in the clubhouse.

- Hey.
- Hey, doll.

Just in time. I've got some reporters.
You feel like talking?

- No.
- You sure?

Gilroy and the chief
are gonna push this story.

- Your team deserves a lot of credit.
- Yeah. Let the poster boy do his thing.

Talk to you.

- The john's still not working?
- The plumber must have got lost.

The city wants to thank us
for a job well done.

How about making sure...

...we don't all have to cram into
the same damn stall?

- Yeah!
- Amen, brother.

- Vic, can I see you?
- Give me a sec.

- I need you now.
- I'm taking a piss...

...provided a spot in the ladies' room
opens up. I got my fingers crossed.

Now.

Aye, aye, captain.

- Right.
- Get off me, man.

Have fun in here, bro.

- You remember Miguel Esteana.
- Sure.

Miguel's a piece-of-shit drug dealer
with the 25th Street Coronas.

This is the kind of attitude
you foster under your command?

- Mr. Esteana's attorney, Jose Garcia.
- I know Jose.

He represents
piece-of-shit drug dealers.

What I do is ensure my client's rights
aren't violated by thugs like you.

Mr. Esteana claims you used
excessive force during his arrest.

Really?

Is that what you claim, Miguel?

That is some hickey.
Boyfriend give you that?

No, I say you did it with some pliers.

I don't recall any pliers.

I do remember the eight dime bags
of H we nabbed you with.

The search we'll be contesting
with Judge McAllister.

I'm sorry. I'm drawing a blank
on this whole pliers thing.

Feel free to ask my guys,
but I don't think they'll remember it.

- You're a disgrace.
- That's funny.

I don't recall signing up for ethics
class from a scumbag drug lawyer.

Is that all, or can I go take that piss?

- So Miguel is lying?
- Anything to stay out of jail.

- Fourth complaint since I came here.
- Lucky for me you don't believe them.

Keep smiling for the cameras.

See what you can do
about getting the men's john fixed.

I stopped listening to you
five minutes ago.

I'm saying our unsub's disorganized,
a record, not a history of violence.

- Unsub?
- Unidentified subject.

- You mean the killer?
- Yeah.

Then just say that. Christ.

- Think Danny would go out with me?
- Danny?

This study says over 40 percent
of female law enforcement...

...meet their spouses on the job.

You wanna date again, fine...

...but why chase after a unit cop in
our own station? That's just lazy, son.

Out of uniform, I bet she's a knockout.

Sign up for dance classes,
take out an ad, join a book club.

For God's sake,
show some imagination.

- No wonder your wife left you.
- Hey, hey.

Lucy had intimacy issues
unrelated to me.

Right. Unrelated to you.
Buzzer, sarge.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

If you're such an expert, how come
both your husbands left you?

It sure as hell wasn't
for a lack of imagination.

- You got a missing kid?
- Jenny Reborg, 8 years old.

- Found her mother stabbed to death.
- Any leads?

- We're following some things up.
- What have you got so far?

The father's a crackhead.
Personal nature of the crime...

...his daughter missing,
he's gonna be our guy.

A neighbor saw Ponyboy Harris
banging on the dead lady's door.

- Who's Ponyboy Harris?
- A local fence.

A bit of a fancy. Collared him
three or four times, personally.

If you guys need anything run down,
just ask. I wanna help.

Thanks, captain.

Since when does he
get his hands dirty?

Can't blame a guy for trying.

- Danny, hey.
- Hey.

How's the coffee? Usual police issue?

- Pretty much.
- Now there's a shock, huh?

Hey, listen, I don't know
what your plans are like...

Hey, lookie here, Shane,
it's the lady-killer!

What's this I'm hearing
about some dead girl's sister...

...blowing you at the crime scene?

- Dutchman, going to town.
- You guys are sick.

Us? Hey, you're the one
getting your pipe smoked...

...by a grieving relative
not 1 0 feet from the body.

She was upset. I was comforting her.

You don't have to tell me
about the different stages of grief.

There's denial, anger, sucking you off.

"If you can think of anything else, call
91 1 and ask for Detective Blow Me."

- Hey, excuse me.
- Detective Blow Me.

Dutch, what? Come on,
don't be so sensitive.

- That was real classy.
- Oh, come on...

...Dutchboy thinks he's a notch
above us.

- I'm just bringing him back to earth.
- That's big of you.

Hey, I gotta go run an errand...

...but I was thinking you and I
should hook up for a drink.

- Oh, yeah, is your wife coming?
- Damn, she can't make it.

Damn, neither can I.

Hey, since when did you get morals?

Always had them.
Sometimes I just lose track.

Really? How's about you
lose track of them tonight?

Yeah, I don't think so.

Hey, you want me to back off?

All you gotta do
is tell me it wasn't great.

You ready?

Yeah.

Back to the Barn.

- Who was that?
- A guy I know.

I went through the books. The guy
I saw Mackey talking to is a dealer...

Named Rondell Robinson.

Right. You're suggesting Mackey's
working for a drug dealer?

- The drug dealer's working for Mackey.
- What?

Robinson's main competition
is a guy named Two-Time.

Mackey's been taking out his dealers,
giving Robinson a monopoly.

A monopoly means profits
go up for Robinson...

...street violence
goes down for Mackey.

And I want you to help me prove it.

Okay.

Who's he?

Moses Hernandez.
We went to SC together.

- He's in Justice. Moses, this is Terry.
- It's good to meet you.

I didn't agree to be
the witness in a federal case.

The friends Mackey has, federal's
the only way we'll nail him.

I go outside the department
and rat out a cop...

...my life's not worth crap in L.A.

He's right.

- It's too dangerous. He can't pull it off.
- I didn't say I couldn't pull it off.

I know. I meant you'd need some
assurances of an upside to all this.

Such as?

Such as a guarantee of a job
in Justice when it's all over.

You think I wanna be an errand boy
in some Alaskan outpost?

You pick the city, then.

Okay. Try the home office in D.C.
And I'm gonna need moving expenses.

- Sure.
- Plus a car and a nice, big fruit basket.

I'm giving up my life,
give me something back.

- I can make it happen.
- No offense...

...l'd like it in writing today.
- Let's be clear here, Terry.

We're talking about making a case...

...that puts Mackey behind bars
for a long time.

Because if we only wound him, his
friends upstairs will crush both of us.

- Yeah, I know what I have to do.
- Good.

I know what I'm getting out of this.
What are you getting out of this?

I just want a dirty cop off the street.

You wanna be mayor someday...

...you better learn how to lie
a hell of a lot better than that.

Ponyboy.

Goddamn! Claudette, look
what you made me do.

What is all this stuff?

That's just a big bunch of VCRs
I stole from Circuit City.

I don't know anything about that girl,
all right? Be real. You know me.

What were you doing
at Nancy Reborg's house?

- I was looking for her old man, Lonnie.
- Lonnie's not living there anymore.

- I know that.
- You ever find Lonnie?

You know Bunny Jenkins?

Said he was using at this crackhouse
run by a guy named Monty.

I was gonna head there
after I unloaded the VCRs...

...which is when you showed up.
- Okay. Good.

Let's talk about how you
and me are gonna work out...

...this Circuit City misunderstanding.
Claudette. Claudette.

He said, "Shut up, bitch."

- She was rapping?
- She was, like, 50 years old.

- Vic?
- Oh, what?

You know a crackhouse
run by some guy named Monty?

Yeah, sure. It's on Crescent,
just west of Seventh.

- Why?
- I gotta pick up a smokehound.

Oh, no, no. No can do. Monty gives
me dirt, I give him safe passage.

This guy might have something to do
with the missing girl.

All right, I'll go get him myself.
My cards suck anyway.

- Oh, come on, Vic.
- No, no, I gotta go.

Shut up.

- Vic.
- Open.

Shut up.

- Lonnie Reborg, he here?
- In there. There a problem?

Show me.

Okay, Lonnie, let's go.
Come on, rise and shine.

- You stop that.
- Let's go.

What did he do?

- You got kids here.
- It's teacher institute day.

- Where's their mom?
- Buying supplies.

Christ, you can't have kids
running around this place.

- What am I supposed to do?
- Stick them in a backroom.

- Rent The Lion King.
- Someone stole the TV.

Then buy them crayons,
for chrissake.

Just keep them away from this shit.

Think back, Lonnie.
You killed your wife last night.

- Why do you keep saying that?
- Because that's the God's truth, son.

- You can't lie to God.
- Or the crime lab.

- Her blood's all over your shirt.
- I don't even got a shirt.

It's evidence now.

- Where's Jenny?
- Jenny?

- Your daughter, where is she?
- I just went there to pick her up.

- Well, where is she?
- I needed her.

You remember killing Nancy?

- You remember the knife?
- I just went there for Jenny.

- Think, Lonnie. You went over there...
- I said that.

- To get Jenny.
- She's half mine.

- Nancy made you angry.
- She wouldn't let me take Jenny.

You didn't mean to kill her.
She made you do it.

I wouldn't kill no one.

Think, Lonnie.
What did you do to Nancy?

- I don't feel good.
- Concentrate.

- What happened to Nancy?
- I don't...

- You gotta keep trying.
- I am trying.

I went there to get Jenny.

Yeah.

Nancy tried to stop me.

Keep going, Lonnie.

She had a knife.

What then?

I took it away from her.

What is it?

What is it, Lonnie?

I killed her.

I killed my sweet Nancy!

- And where's Jenny?
- What did I do that for?

- Because you like crack?
- My daughter.

- Told you from the start this guy did it.
- Now, where is she?

I sold her.

- Sold her? Sold her to who?
- He gave me 200 bucks.

- Who did?
- This guy.

He likes girls.

How come...?
How come nobody stopped me, huh?

I don't know.

Search warrant!

George Sawyer?

Where's Jenny Reborg?

Sexy Schoolgirls, Jane at 1 5.
This is quite the reading list.

Where's my mother?
It's time for her medication.

I'll make a call and make sure
she gets her meds.

If you wanna hold
this pervert's hand, be my guest.

Can I get you a cup of coffee?

Okay. Who took my Ding Dongs?

- Problem, Dutchboy?

- I had some Ding Dongs.
They're gone.

Ding Dongs. What are you,
in kindergarten?

I've got a suspect
whose profile screams...

...organized, humiliation-driven
offender, so he won't crack easy.

Which means I've got an interrogation
that's gonna go all night.

Which means I need my Ding Dongs,
and you took them. Didn't you?

Right.

I can't make it through the night
without your Ding Dongs.

- Stay away from me and my desk.
- We've got an interview.

- What are you riled up about?
- He took my Ding Dongs.

Oh, come on, son,
fork over his Ding Dongs.

In my old squad, people had respect
for people's property.

Oh, man, forget it.

How come everybody loves
this asshole so much?

Let's go. We've got an interview. I saw
some Twinkies in the break room.

It's not the same thing.

Here's your coffee.

When are you gonna call
about my mom's pills?

In a minute.

- I got nothing to hide.
- I know.

Hey, tell me something.

You think there's something wrong
with gay people?

- Something wrong?
- In the head, you know? With queers.

I mean, you think
they got a screw loose?

- I don't know.
- Not so long ago...

...the medical community classified
homosexuality as a disorder.

- Called it an illness.
- Yeah?

Now scientists think maybe
something genetic makes people gay.

So?

For Booking.

So if God made them that way...

...who are we to say they're wrong
for doing the things they do?

That got me thinking.

What if scientists discovered
there's a gene...

...that predisposes some people
to be attracted to young girls?

You think there is, in some people?

Well, why not?

And if scientists
discovered that gene, then...

Well, then maybe
people won't think...

...it's so wrong to have sex
with underage girls.

Maybe not.

Forgot to call about your mom's pills.

Hey!

How's the car running, Miguel?

It's leaking oil.

Well, these old cars
always need a lot of work.

Must be a pretty handy guy
with these tools, huh?

- No pliers, though.
- Miguel's not too fond of pliers.

I can't say as I blame him.

Where's your lawyer, Miguel?

I don't know, ése.

Miguel Esteana is dropping
his complaint against you.

Told you it was bogus.

I'd like your incident report
first thing tomorrow morning.

Sure, it'll be a couple of days.
I got something on the back burner.

It's not a request.

Tomorrow morning.

You'll get my report
in a couple of days, maybe a week.

If you don't like it,
take it up with Gilroy.

I don't have to.
In this building, I'm in charge.

Maybe in your own mind, amigo, but
in the real world, I don't answer to you.

Not today, not tomorrow,
not even on Cinco de Mayo.

- You call for the police?
- Yeah, about two and a half hours ago.

- What's the problem?
- What you think the problem is?

- Look at my goddamn tires!
- Someone slashed your tires?

Was the real police busy today?

- Any idea who might've done this?
- Lamar, he's my ex.

Hey. Look, I see he wasn't handling
his responsibilities as a man.

I see that, I got no choice
but to step in.

Did you witness this Lamar
slash your tires?

Yeah, bro, I got
the whole thing on tape.

Come on, the brother dumb,
but he ain't stupid.

- Are you gonna go arrest him?
- We'll talk to him.

Can you think of anyone else
who might've slashed your tires?

- Like who?
- Maybe a business associate?

Business associate?
What, you trying to imply something?

No, I'm just wondering why you got
a $30,000 car with $500 tires...

...parked outside of
a $400-a-month apartment.

Give me the goddamn money.

You, go to work.

Dmitri, I heard you got paroled.
I see you got your old job back.

I'm just temping for somebody
who got the flu.

Hand it over.

- Bankroll too.
- Come on, Mackey, man...

...that's just my playing-around coin.

This ain't right.

- Get lost.
- Yes, sir.

What did I tell you last week?
No more free passes, right?

- I know.
- Then let's go. Come on.

- Any news on Two-Time's party?
- It's definitely on for Saturday night.

You sure? Because I gotta be sure.

Well, he called up Ringo and asked
for his four best girls for Saturday.

Guess I got left off the list.

You look like you lost some weight.
You been eating?

Sure, after business hours.

I give you some money, you skip
a couple of tricks, get some soup?

- I don't need your money, Vic.
- Here, you look thin. Get some soup.

Don't worry about me, Vic.
I get by.

Where's your boy?

With my mom.

Here. Get him some soup too.

- You're sweet, Vic.
- Hey, go see your son.

I got a daughter, 1 4 next month.

She's got some friends
like to come over...

...hang out, do homework,
that kind of thing.

I don't know anything
about that missing girl.

You know who Britney Spears is?

I've seen videos.

My daughter's got these friends
like to dress up like Britney Spears.

Tight jeans, cutoff T-shirts.

Thirteen years old.

She's got this one friend, Natalie.

I'm telling you...

I shouldn't be thinking
what I'm thinking...

...but the way this goddamn girl looks.
I mean...

She may not be a woman yet,
but you can't call her a girl.

You know what I'm saying?

Thirteen's a good age.

Yeah. Yeah, I bet it is.

Can I get you some more coffee?

- I didn't know Dutch had a daughter.
- He doesn't.

- What's your take on Vic Mackey?
- How do you mean?

You know what I mean.

I hear things.

As long as Mackey's producing
on the street, he's got friends.

Gilroy, even the chief.

- So he's bullet-proof, huh?
- From you, yeah.

I know what everybody here thinks.

I'm a test-taker.
I didn't earn it on the street.

Came time to name a captain,
I was the right color at the right time.

You think taking on Mackey's
gonna change people's minds?

I'm just talking.

Right now Vic Mackey must look
like a mighty big catch to you.

Do the smart thing, though, son.
Cut bait.

Doesn't bother you,
the things he does?

I don't judge other cops.

Mackey's not a cop.
He's Al Capone with a badge.

Al Capone made money
by giving people what they wanted.

What people want is to make it
to their cars without getting mugged.

Come home from work,
see their stereo still there.

Hear about some murder
in the barrio...

...find out the next day
the police caught the guy.

If those things means
some cop roughs up...

...some nigger or spic in the ghetto,
as far as most people are concerned...

...it's don't ask, don't tell.

How you figure on changing that?

- Lamar Tilton?
- Yeah?

We're investigating vandalism
to a car owned by your ex.

You mean the tires I slashed?

- Yeah.
- You admit to vandalizing the car?

- Sure, why not?
- Because the car isn't yours?

I gave that skank $ 1 500
on the down payment.

Day after she makes the delivery,
she kicks me out...

...then gives the car to this scrawny
bitch she's been balling on the side.

- Your point being?
- My point being $ 1 500.

Shit. The way I figured it,
that at least make the tires mine.

Look, you tell that bitch if she got
a problem, she know where I am.

- Man, this is all wrong, man.
- Jewelry.

- You see that new guy she's with?
- Yeah, I saw him.

Well, then you know what kind of prick
I'm dealing with here.

Hey, so where's the love?

The Bible. Galatians,
Chapter 7, Verse 6:

For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.

Oh, you can stop
with the sermon, grandma.

When am I getting out?

As soon as you arraign
and you post bail.

- You got anything else?
- How much bail gonna be?

- Three hundred dollars.
- Three hundred?

I don't got that kind of cash.

How are you able to afford
all this jewelry, then?

I don't gotta explain myself to you.

Lonnie knew I liked them young.
He needed money.

Said I could do whatever
I wanted for 200 bucks.

When he brought her by, it was
obvious she was like 7, 8 years old.

- Well, is that a problem?
- I told Lonnie I like them 1 2 or 1 3.

Like you were talking about,
developed a little.

- You must've been disappointed.
- Yeah.

Lonnie had already spent the money,
so even though I didn't want her...

...the girl was, you know,
she was still mine.

- So you got rid of her.
- Hey, I don't hurt them.

I like them to like me, romantic-like.
Things just didn't work out this time.

- What did you do with her?
- I traded her.

- You traded her?
- To this doctor I met on the Internet.

He likes them 7 or 8.
He came right over and picked her up.

- You traded her?
- I was out $200.

- Well, what did this doctor trade you?
- A girl to be named later.

You know, like the kind of trades
ball teams make.

Right.

- That's a nice boat.
- Thanks.

I take the kids up to Lake Tahoe
every year, fishing, swimming.

Sounds great.

Two weeks' vacation doesn't make up
for a year of double shifts...

...but the kids look forward to it.
- How's the meat?

- Five more minutes, bring out the buns.
- Great.

Did you tell Matthew
he could keep a spider in his room?

- That's for a school project.
- Lf that thing gets loose...

- It won't.
- Yeah, well, it better not.

- It won't.
- Better not.

Hey, what did I tell you
about jumping in the...?

They grow up too quick,
especially with the job we got.

Yeah. What you're doing, though,
it has to be done.

- You think?
- Absolutely.

My dad was a cop.
He admired guys like you.

Those were some honest-to-goodness
men back then, huh?

Guys like Captain Aceveda,
he'd never understand.

What do you expect
from a damn quota baby?

I think I could be a lot more
useful to you.

You know, do more than just drive.

- Yeah?
- Yeah. I mean, I know why...

...you've been reluctant to include me.
You got a team.

They watch out for each other,
know each other.

They'd kill to protect each other.

It's all about trust,
otherwise you end up dead.

Listen, listen, listen. Up till now,
Two-Time's been impossible to nail.

He never keeps drugs
at his place, until tonight.

- What's so special about tonight?
- He's gearing up for a bash tomorrow.

He's got coke
he's handing out as party favors.

It's our chance to nail him
with the goods.

- Lock and load, baby.
- Yeah.

This is not gonna be
any beauty pageant, ladies.

He's got steel-enforced doors,
which means we go...

...through a window
and we gotta be fast.

Knock, knock. "Who's there?"
Strike Team, Mr. Drug Dealer.

Hey, and on top of that...

...Terry's losing his cherry
tonight. He's coming with us.

- Terry, he's gonna lose his cherry.
- Terry's cherry.

Congratulations, my friend.

Hey, hey, hey.
Remember, the team comes first.

We take care of each other, all right?

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

We have a few more questions,
Mr. Grady.

- Dr. Grady.
- Right, Dr. Grady.

And I have a practice
to attend to, patients to see.

So charge me with something
or release me.

- Do you know who Jenny Reborg is?
- No.

George Sawyer says
he gave Jenny to you...

...for the purpose
of sexual intercourse.

I don't even know the man.

You tell us where Jenny is, we'll get
the DA to make a favorable offer.

Charge me or release me.

We'll see what we can do.

Tell me something. As a man
of science, I'd like your opinion.

Is homosexuality genetic
or environment?

- The latest studies suggest it's genetic.
- Really? Just the way they are.

- Can't help themselves, huh?
- I see where you're going with this.

Don't waste my time. Or yours.

I've got plenty of time.

I'm bored. Charge me or release me.

This guy's definitely
a dominationlcontrol pedophile.

- Is he capable of killing her?
- Fits the profile.

- Let him sit for a couple hours.
- Couple hours?

We got a girl missing.
Who knows if she's got food or water.

I can break this guy
by the end of the day.

There's no way
this pecker's gonna talk.

I know what buttons
to push for this guy.

- I'm smarter than he is.
- This is not a quiz show, Dutch.

Lose the ego.
Think about Jenny Reborg.

- I am. You got a better plan?
- Yes, let him go.

- Let him go?
- And we tail him.

We lose him, first thing
he's gonna do is kill her.

- Look, I can break this guy.
- Your way will get her killed!

So will yours.

- Anywhere in here.
- What about attack dogs? I hate dogs.

I need you.

And who are you?

Who is he?

You know what you're doing, son?

What's in the bag?

What's that stuff for?

It's what I'm gonna use to get you
to tell me where Jenny Reborg is.

- Your turn to play bad cop?
- No.

Good cop and bad cop left for the day.

I'm a different kind of cop.

- I'm ready to see my lawyer now.
- Later, later, later.

Right now it's just you and me.

People are watching us.

I got a little girl back at home.

An 8-year-old daughter,
her name is Cassidy.

What do you say I bring her down
here, let you stick your dick in her?

- How would you like that?
- What?

You know, suck her tits
a little bit, maybe.

Not interested.

So you'll nail some other
guy's little girl, but not my Cassidy?

What's up with that, man?

I'd like to take a look
at this Jenny for myself.

See what she's got
that my Cassidy doesn't.

- I'm sure you could arrange that.
- I don't know where the girl is.

Her name is Jenny Reborg.

I'm giving you one chance to let me
know where you're hiding her.

I'm sorry, I wish I could...

He hit me. He hit me.
Somebody... You're the police!

He's got a basement apartment
under a fake name.

Jenny's there alone.
Last he knew, she was still alive.

You got something
to say, Dutchboy, huh?

Like, "Thanks for solving my case"?

Just glad I could help.

Jenny!

Watch out, watch out.

Come on.
Come on, goddamn it. Come on.

It's okay, baby.

Jenny. Jenny, you're safe
now, sweetie. You're safe now.

No way, man.
I ain't gotta listen to you.

Hey, Dutch. I heard you
found your missing girl.

Yeah. Guy turned out to be
a dominationlcontrol sociopath.

- Had her locked in this cage thing.
- Good thing you took him out.

Yeah. So, what are you doing here?
Your shift was over this morning.

As l... Right?

Wickman and Greenmont called in
sick. Me and Julien had to work.

- Oh, I hate doubles.
- I'm on my way home now.

Listen, I was gonna grab a beer
with some of my old buddies...

...from Sunset, in case
you wanna tag along.

- That'd be great.
- Great.

But I'm not free tonight.
I mean, my friend Betsy...

...set me up on this blind date.

- It's probably gonna be a nightmare...
- No, it sounds like fun.

So some other time, okay?
I mean, I'd love to go out with you...

...and the guys and stuff and hear
some of the old stories.

- What's that smell?
- What?

- You don't smell that?
- Oh, man. Oh, yeah.

- What is that?
- It's dog shit. Jesus Christ.

All right, all right, whoever did this
better clean it up right now.

Oh, it's you, isn't it?

Clean this up, or I'm gonna
shove it down your throat.

Hey, you got the wrong guy.
But I promise you...

...I am not gonna rest until
the culprit is brought to justice.

Hey, attention, everyone. I'm declaring
this an official crime scene.

Nobody leaves here
without providing a stool sample.

- Yeah, right.
- Who gets to bag the evidence?

- Some prank, huh?
- Yeah.

You know, I once heard
about this old cop tradition.

Any time someone in the squad
started getting a big head...

...some other cop would put dog crap
in his locker. Or desk.

Remind him he's just one guy,
part of the team.

You heard about that, huh?

Give me that.

Get out.

Previously on The Shield:

The next 2 4 hours,
she's your one and only case.

Prostitute. Age 1 2 to 1 4.
Had a sweet tooth.

Guy who murdered Sally is out there.
I'm here with my dick in my hand...

...because this guy thought it'd be
funny to rake his buddy over the coals.

You're lucky. Matthew is a charming,
intelligent boy. He also has autism.

Autism?

I don't think I can sell
a cop to these voters.

What would you think of a man
who exposed corruption...

...brought down dirty cops
from inside the department?

I'd think he was committing
professional suicide.




- But could you sell him to the voters?
- Absolutely.

- Bag it.
- Bag it.

- Bag it.
- Bag it.

Bag it.

I wanna know what you found
in the Navigator.

Isn't a stolen-car case
below your radar?

Where are the drugs?

- I saw them pocket the cocaine.
- I told you to let this go.

I may answer to you,
but I also answer to God.

Cops here will treat you like a traitor.

You'll take more shit than ever.

- Are you ready for that kind of heat?
- I'll have to be.

You done already?

I need someone to listen to me.




- I'm busy. Maybe one of the uniforms...
- I said, I need someone to listen to me.

Okay.

Did you wanna report a crime?

I've lost track of all the crimes.

- I don't understand...
- I've lived here all my life...

...keeping my complaints
to myself. But no more.

My apartment has been broken into
seven times in the last four years.

Seven times!
And you never catch anyone!

You have got graffiti and cuss words
on every single wall that you see!

I've got needles on my sidewalk,
beer cans on my lawn...

...and I stopped ducking at
the sound of gunshot years ago.

We can drop smart bombs
down chimneys half a world away.

But some sicko gets released from jail
because of a computer screwup...

...and rapes my niece.

How does this make sense?

I see yellow police tape
everywhere that I go.

And it's all sirens and helicopters
and searchlights.

You've got mothers
killing their children...

...children killing strangers, maniacs
flying airplanes into buildings...

...and I just want life to go back
to the way that it should have been.

What are you doing
to make us feel safe?

I love the action, but what
are we doing in Watts?

We got eight people dead.
Nine, if you count the fetus.

- Gang war on steroids.
- Chief doesn't like headlines.

If my ass is on the line,
I want my best man covering me.

Appreciate the compliment...

...but won't Northwest get pissed
with me and Shane on their turf?

- The lead detective is Carlos Zamora.
- Never heard of him.

He's a comer, but he's raw.

Built his reputation working with
gangs. Knows them inside out.

- He know how we work?
- Let him do his thing...

...you do your thing. I don't care,
as long as it gets cracked.

Carlos, Vic Mackey. Shane Vendrell.

- Thanks for helping.
- What gang were they in?

- Toros. Biggest and baddest here.
- Cameras catch this guy?

Just for show.
VCRs weren't hooked up.

- Who's the mom-to-be?
- Lucy. She was Train's girl.

- Train?
- Train Gutierrez. He runs the Toros.

Well, Train's gonna
wanna retaliate bigtime.

We find who he's targeting,
we find who did this.

I'll talk to Train, make sure
his guys don't do anything stupid.

What makes you think he'll listen?

I used to be a Toro back in the day.

I've been able to keep
a pretty good lid on things.

Looks like the lid just got blown off.

The owner said there's
a high school kid...

...who sweeps up at night.
Wasn't part of the body count.

- Kid call in sick?
- No. He should've been here.

Name is Jaime.

You seeing this?

- Goddamn Oprah Winfrey hour.
- Paging Dr. Phil.

No wonder Gilroy called us up.

A gang war's about to explode and he's
playing grief counselor to the soldiers.

You gotta let me handle this, Train,
me entiendes?

He's right. We'll handle it.

I'm working this case with Carlos.
Who would wanna start a war with you?

- Things been peaceful, eh.
- Until tonight. So who was it?

- I told you, we've been handling things.
- Right.

- What's that bulge in your jacket?
- Yo, chill, dog.

Come on, man. What? What?

Concealed weapon.

- Suspicious white powder.
- Daily double.

So do I have to search all you guys,
or do I get some answers?

Is it the blacks, Chinese, Los Mags?
Who're we talking about?

The blacks. Wet Willie. He's been
making noise since he got paroled.

What do you know? A clue.

Hey!

Why are you shaking down these guys?
They trust me.

- Yeah. I saw the circle jerk.
- You treat them like people, it works.

So does treating them like the killing,
dealing, thieving scumbags they are.

Mop-up boy went MIA tonight.
See if you can track him down.

- Where you going?
- Talk to Wet Willie.

I can do it. I know where
to find Wet Willie.

Hey, this might be your district,
but it's my world.

Different ZIP code, same pinheads.

Describe what you witnessed then.

Mackey put four bricks of cocaine into
evidence bags, two into weapons bags.

- Then he gave it to Shane, I think.
- You think?

You "think" is not "I'm sure." I called
IAD because you said you were sure.

- Okay.
- This is serious, Julien.

There's no point in doing
the right thing...

...if your testimony is vague.
- I know.

Now, did Mackey give Shane
the cocaine then or did it happen later?

- No, it happened then.
- Then say that.

The statement you give to Frances...

...Mackey's lawyers will twist it
into anything but the truth.

- Do I have to say this in open court?
- Hopefully not.

It won't be good publicity
for Vic or the department.

If it goes the way I've planned,
they'll take a plea.

- They'll lose their jobs?
- Oh, yeah.

Jail?

Julien.

Are you okay living with that?

What's fair for them out there
has to be fair for us in here.

Facing Autism?
What's up with that?

That's Corrine's book.

A kid in Matthew's class
just got diagnosed.

Oh, man, that's tough.
Family must be devastated, huh?

Yeah. I had this cousin
who was retarded.

Autism isn't the same thing
as being retarded.

What is it, like Rain Man, freaking out,
counting matchsticks kind of thing?

No. It's not the same thing.

You don't care to educate yourself,
why don't you keep your mouth shut.

Describe what you saw at that point.

Detective Mackey placed four bricks
of cocaine into two evidence bags.

He then took two bricks
and placed it into a weapons bag...

... which he immediately handed
to Detective Vendrell.

- Hey. I thought you were off today.
- I am.

- What are you doing here?
- Taking care of business.

I'm glad I caught you. I've been trying
to figure out how to handle this thing.

- And I had this idea...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

Julien, I'm your training officer.
You owe it to me to at least see if...

No offense, but I'm gonna go
my own way on this.

Okay, here's Wet Willie.

Take his buddy.
Keep him out of my way.

Go.

Wet Willie! Police! Stop!

- I said, stop!
- I'll be with you in a minute.

Goddamn it! I said, stop!

- You got the medicine?
- Right here.

Now, what do you want?

- What you sweating me for?
- I'm a cop. Slow down.

Slow down. Right here.
Hands behind your head.

- I didn't do nothing.
- Ever?

Or in the last 1 0 minutes,
Kunta Kinte?

Suck my dick.

- What'd you say? Suck your what?
- Screw you.

So you've been
with your sick kid all night?

- He's been throwing up all over me.
- The mom can back you up?

My girlfriend, her sister, her friend,
the nurse at the free clinic. Man, why?

Never mind.

Suck your what? Suck your what?

- Hey. Shane!
- What's going on out there?

- Suck that, you piece of shit.
- Shane! Shane!

- What are you doing?
- Patty, call the police.

- Shane! Let's go!
- Call the police.

- What's going on out there?
- Get the license plate!

- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- No!

We're trying to prevent the war,
not start one, you stupid...

Goddamn.
The guy was a pain in the ass.

You're being a huge pain in the ass
lately. Should I take a piss on you?

- You're out of control.
- You want me out, say the word.

And don't think I won't!

You've gone over those things
1 0 times already.

He's a serial killer. Sally won't be
his last victim unless I catch him.

- You're obsessed.
- I'm dedicated. Hey, hey.

Come with me. You're too dedicated.

You need a gimme
to cleanse your palate.

- Low-priority files?
- Pick a card, any card.

What's the point of this?

We take half a day,
we make some citizen happy...

...and go back to your serial-killer
case on a winning streak.

- I don't have time for games.
- You're running in circles.

Now, I've got the cure.
So pick a card.

My mother's being
robbed by a psychic.

- A psychic?
- Her name's Frida.

She's bilked my mom and her
friends out of thousands of dollars.

What's the scam? Tainted-money con,
third-party ritual, elixir machine?

She claims to talk
to my dead father.

My mom took out a second
mortgage on the house...

...to pay Frida for contacting
the spirit world.

But that's supposed
to be my house someday.

- Well, that is a problem.
- I know. What are you gonna do?

- Any luck with Wet Willie?
- He's not the guy.

We better find out who is before Train
makes a guess and starts shooting.

- Got a line on our missing mop-up boy.
- Yeah?

A gangbanger friend of his called
me and told me where he is.

- A banger just called you up?
- I told you, man, these guys trust me.

Jaime's bragging he saw the shooter
come out of the gun club.

- Great. Where do I find this Jaime?
- I got this one. Wanna back me up?

Just follow my taillights.

You sure you don't want one of these?
You look awfully tense.

I just testified before IAD.

I don't get why you'd complicate
your life by narc'ing out another cop.

Because in my life,
I take personal responsibility.

You might wanna try it sometime.

Ouch.

Skipping out on restaurant bills,
outstanding warrants.

- You don't even have a job.
- I make money here and there.

I'm a cop. I know what
"here and there" means.

If this is what you're like,
I can't be around you.

I really think you could use a beer.

When this housesitting gig ends,
you won't have a place to live.

- Oh, whatever will I do?
- I'm serious. Do you even have a plan?

When was the last time
you even applied for a job?

What's your plan? To keep pretending
you're something you're not?

- It's not that easy.
- I'll try if you'll try.

- Jaime?
- Nah, Jaime left.

Try again, smart-ass.
Finish your drinks somewhere else.

Jaime, we hear you saw
the gun-club shooter tonight.

What colors was he wearing?

Stop posing for a picture
and start yapping.

- You saw the shooter, right?
- Maybe.

- What gang was the shooter in?
- You know who the shooter runs with?

No.

You're not blind,
and you only seem half stupid...

...so I bet you got a good guess
who this guy's affiliated with.

Tell us.

- You guys ain't listening.
- What gang was the shooter in?

The white people's gang.

Our shooter is white?

- Early to mid-30s.
- Gringo with a grudge.

- There goes our gang-war theory.
- More headlines the chief won't like.

The Latino community is on edge.

Raoul Jimenez is on his way
to hear our progress.

Jimenez? He run out of janitor
strikes to organize?

What pisses you off more?
That he fights the establishment...

...or that he usually wins?

Thanks for the new partner,
by the way.

- It's a hate crime.
- We don't know what it is yet.

A white man kills eight Latinos, and
you don't know if it's a hate crime?

My people are scared.
What are the police doing?

- We got a drawing of the shooter.
- Even the artist won't vouch for that.

Our witness didn't see much
past the white skin.

Release it to the press. Maybe
someone will recognize him.

It's so vague, every Anglo on the street
is gonna look like a suspect.

- Now you know how we feel every day.
- Please. Save it for the microphones.

I think it's important the public
knows who the enemy is.

It's a waste of time, Ben.

Release the sketch.

Since when do we kowtow
to the "Mexico First" crowd?

If we don't include him,
he'll make our lives hell.

Let him try.

Have you driven around the city
lately? He's the majority now.

- We're still wearing the badges.
- Yeah, for the time being.

How is screwing up an investigation
gonna keep Jimenez off our backs?

I'm counting on you
not to screw it up.

Bring in this killer and we keep
our badges another day.

- Hey, no one's taking mine away.
- We're dinosaurs, Vic.

And make no mistake,
the meteor's coming.

Your son says you're being
swindled by this psychic.

Frida's not a psychic,
she's a medium.

She predicted Gene would
go to the police, didn't she?

Yes. She said Gene was waiting for
me to die so he could get my money.

You do know these so-called
psychics are all frauds, right?

Well, most of them are, but not Frida.
She brings me messages from Frank.

- Frank?
- He was my husband. Cancer got him.

How do you think Frank would feel
if you lost the house you lived in...

...to keep paying this medium?

I'd pay anything to talk to Frank.

- Detective Mackey? I'm with...
- IAD. Yeah, I remember.

An investigation has been initiated
into your actions on April 2nd.

Look over these charges and decide
if you'd like a formal interview.

Vic. We got five people shot dead
in a family grocer's, all Latinos.

- This one's in your district.
- I'll have to get back to you.

Here they come. Secure the front.
Don't let anybody else in, okay?

- Officer.
- Detectives.

- What happened?
- Guy came in blasting.

Killed everybody in here
except the owner in back.

He heard the shots, came out with
a baseball bat and ran the shooter off.

- Where's the owner now?
- He's pretty upset. This was his son.

- My boy.
- You were back here?

- Yes.
- And you grabbed the baseball bat?

That baseball bat over there?

Now, the shooter, he was white?

What happened after
you chased him out?

- He got away.
- On foot? He didn't get into a car?

- No.
- Well, which way did he run?

I don't remember.

There's blood on this bat.
Did you hit him with it?

I guess. I don't remember.

Our bad guy may have ran away,
but this being L. A...

...l'm guessing he drove here.

Check the plates on these cars. Match
them up and see what stands out.

You want me doing grunt work?

Yeah. Because, A, it's important...

...and B, I don't really feel like
hearing you talk this morning.

I got a 1 0-square-block
perimeter being roped off.

If he's on foot and bleeding,
we'll get him.

Oh, gee, I wonder what
took them so long.

Can I help you?

We're investigating complaints
about your business practices.

I offer a money-back guarantee
to those who are unhappy.

Very few people request it.

Six hundred dollars for a candle?

Looks like the kind I get
at the 99-cent store.

The candle itself is ordinary.

It's the blessing ceremony
that makes them so valuable.

Blessing ceremony.
What does that entail?

Taking the price tag off,
sticking it on a shelf?

We'd like you to come with us,
answer a few questions.

You yearn for a young woman
who doesn't yearn after you.

What? You see I'm not wearing a ring,
you figure a guy who shops at the...

...99-cent store is single and has the
hots for some woman out of his league.

Is now when I fork over a week's
salary for a candle, or?

She's someone that you work with
or work close by.

Come on, let's go.

You're wasting your time
with her, you know.

Frances will ask about
the night you stole the truck.

And this'll clean the slate
on all my charges, right?

Right. So long as you tell the truth.

- So how do you want me to do it?
- Do what?

Tell my story. I mean, you're paying,
so you get to pick.

I can be all sweet and innocenty, like:

I don't know what possessed me
to steal the truck that night...

...but when I found those bags of
cocaine inside, I got so scared.

Or I can be all biker-chick,
master-thief girl.

Like: I ripped the Navigator,
was on my way to get it chopped...

...and I stumble across
these two keys of blow.

- How about sincere and honest?
- Not my best one.

- Don't get too cute with her.
- But I am cute.

- Are you involved with anyone?
- Excuse me?

Well, my most recent lover
just died of a drug overdose...

...thanks to high-octane stolen coke,
so I find myself sexually available.

If by involved you mean married with
a baby girl, then the answer is yes.

Damn. Think of the things I could get
away with if I was banging a captain.

Stay out of trouble so I don't
have to see you again.

- Oh, but you wanna see me again.
- No, I don't.

If I was 1 8 and single,
maybe it'd be a different story.

Oh, I would've chewed you up
and spit you out when you were 1 8.

I wouldn't be so sure.

The other shop owners
tell the same story.

They heard gunshots,
but didn't see anything.

Nobody looked out and saw
which way this guy went running?

- That's what they say.
- That doesn't pass the smell test.

Vic!

This is the only car whose owner
is unaccounted for.

Check it out.

- Spare ammo.
- Who's the car registered to?

- A George Michael Klassen.
- Nice to meet you, you sick prick.

All clear.

Oh, goddamn it.

As I was going through the truck,
I found...

...some guns
and two bags of cocaine.

Okay, let's go back
to stealing the vehicle.

You saw Detective Vendrell
park the truck, get out...

- ... and go inside the building.
- Yes, ma'am.

And no one went in or out of the truck
between the time...

... he left it and the time you stole it.

No, ma'am.

It's always sad when the people
that you expect to enforce the law...

...break it themselves.

Canvass the place. Find out
if anybody saw a car pulling out.

We found two bodies inside.
They're George's in-laws.

- Oh, my God.
- But his wife and son, they're not here.

We're afraid George might have
taken them with him.

Any idea where your brother
might have gone?

No.

Any place he might feel
comfortable hiding?

- No.
- This is important.

We have to find him before
he does any harm to them.

Well, I can't imagine George
would ever hurt Myra or Brady.

Can you imagine him killing
1 5 people in cold blood?

Well, that's different.

I mean, you have to understand.

This used to be a nice place to live.
Clean, safe.

George just got fed up being
surrounded by all the spics.

Can you blame him?

Klassen's picture's plastered
all over the news.

He can't step outside without
somebody spotting him.

That doesn't help us save
his wife and boy.

I'm more concerned about what
you're doing to stop the next attack.

Everything we can.
We know who he is. We got his car.

We got units on his family and
friends. We got every base covered.

Waiting around for him to make
his next move isn't gonna cut it.

Where you going?

Hey, as long as he's got it all covered,
I'm gonna go check on something.

Getting a nice tan?

About all I'm good for, I guess.

- You find any blood out here?
- Nope.

So there was blood on the bat
and nowhere else?

There's some blood in the store
unconnected to any of the victims.

Show me.

Shooter loses this much blood and
doesn't drip any on the pavement?

Maybe he went out the back.

- SID check it?
- Beats me.

Looks like somebody did
a nice little sweep job.

Yes, it does. Makes you wonder why.

You know, Houdini wanted desperately
to believe in the paranormal.

Couldn't abide the fakes and frauds.
Spent his life trying to debunk them.

Still held out hope, though.

Before he died, he gave his wife
Beatrice a secret password...

...that he promised her he'd try
to send her from the afterworld...

...so she could tell the difference
between phonies and the real McCoys.

When he passed away,
Beatrice traveled the globe...

...met with every gypsy, psychic,
tarot-card reader she could find.

Not one of them
ever got the password right.

Houdini should have
had a little more faith.

- Faith?
- On Sundays they call it Christianity.

The afterlife's no different.

Church only takes you for 1 0 percent.
You've been wringing these ladies dry.

If they refuse to press charges,
you can't touch me.

If I find out you still have your hooks
in these women...

...l'll find other charges to press.

- Fire code violations.
- Parking tickets.

Zoning laws. You name it, I'll find it.
How's your future looking now?

What do you want from me?

It's time to get
some new marks, honey.

What the hell is he doing?

- You arrested the shop owners?
- Brought them in for questioning.

- Why?
- Their stories didn't make sense.

Leon's son died four hours ago. How
much sense is he supposed to make?

If he knows something, we need it.

You don't interrogate
a grieving father!

And you don't get answers from
people by passing around hugs.

You don't get them
by pissing on people either.

We've got a racist madman
targeting Latinos...

...and you want to interrogate
the victim's family?!

When you trade your megaphone for a
badge, that's when I'll seek your input.

I insist on witnessing
the interviews...

...to ensure these men and women
aren't mistreated.

- No.
- Excuse me?

I've included you as a courtesy.

It's time to give my men
the space to do their jobs.

His wife and 1 0-year-old son
are missing.

- My son's dead.
- You're not telling me the truth, Leon.

- Yes, I am.
- You know something.

No.

If you're lying so you can get to your
son's killer before us to get revenge...

...I can't let that happen.
- I don't know anything.

Then why are you and the other shop
owners all telling the same lie?

And why did someone sweep the path
in the back alley after the shootings?

Leon?

You can tell me.
What did you really see?

I didn't see nothing.

I just talked with Frances. You've got
her looking into the Strike Team again?

Yes.

You ever plan on telling me about it?

I didn't wanna bother you with it
until things were more definitive.

I got a problem in this squad, David.

My captain and my best cop
aren't getting along.

We stand for different things.

Well, you better make friends,
or I'm gonna have to make a choice.

And I don't think
you're gonna like that choice.

Maybe you should read this
before you make any choices.

You're gonna need a signature
on this here...

I've been getting some very strong
signals at this desk.

Gee, the desk that
I work at? Spooky.

I'm getting an S name.
Is there a Sarah?

Sorry, no Sarahs.

Or a Sally.

I think there's a Sally.

Do you know who I'm talking about?

You going through my desk?
Reading my file on Sally?

No, I didn't.

Frida! There you are!

- Are you all right?
- Fine.

Yeah. Let's all talk in another room.

Follow me.

She has a message for you.

There's an innocent woman and
an innocent kid in danger out there...

...and you're not telling me the truth!
- Yes, I am!

Someone's holding a gun
to their heads right now...

...and you're stopping me
from finding them.

I'm not.

You might as well be pulling
the trigger. Tell me the truth!

- I am!
- He doesn't know anything.

Yes, he does.

- You gonna pull the trigger on that kid?
- Vic!

What does that make you?

- What if it was your boy?
- My boy's dead.

That's because I couldn't stop the
racist pig from pulling that trigger.

Don't be like the man
who killed your son.

- I'm nothing like him.
- Then show me. Show me.

I heard the shots...

...the shots that killed Favian.

When I came outside, the man
was standing there with his...

With his back to me.
I hit him with a baseball bat.

Knocked him out.

What did you do with him?

My friends heard the noise.
They came over.

They dragged him out the back.
That's why we swept up afterwards.

- What did you do with him?
- He killed my boy.

- I know.
- So I wanted to kill him back.

I know.

I couldn't do it, though.
I didn't have the courage.

So, what did you do with him?

We gave him to the Toros.
I couldn't kill him...

...but I knew they would.

Oh, shit. The in-laws were killed
after the grocery shootings.

- So Train or his guys killed them.
- They got the wife and kid.

God help you.

Look out! Heads up!

- Where's Train?
- Get him off me!

I can't do that, Lucas.
You went too far. What did you do?

- He had it coming.
- Did the wife and kid have it coming?

- We were making things better.
- We didn't start the killing.

Where's Train keeping his family?

You wanna tell me
with your teeth or without?

He's not gonna let you
beat me down. He's one of us.

Not after what you did. Now, where
do we find this guy's wife and kid?

You didn't see this coming.
You didn't see this.

- Please don't hurt him.
- What? What? You wanna kiss me?

Please, don't.
We'll do anything you want. Just... No.

- Let go. Please. George!
- Don't touch my mom!

Brady! No!

- Train! Don't do this, Train!
- Put it down!

- For Lucy.
- No!

He had to pay.

And who's gonna pay now?
Who's gonna pay?

We all pay, man.

He's gonna pay for the rest of his life.
You don't want to. Trust me.

It's okay. You're all right.

We've gotta get Vic Mackey
off the streets.

- Have you taken his statement yet?
- No.

- But you have to admit, it looks bad.
- Very bad.

We need to keep this thing
under control.

How can we?

The chief is gonna have a heart attack
when he hears about this.

If the press gets ahold of it...

Goddamn it.
This is the last thing I needed.

I'll talk to my people, make sure
there are no leaks on this end.

Yeah, me too.

Okay. Good.

I just need a few days to figure out
how to handle this.

- What's going to happen to them?
- What do you think?

They handed a man over
to gangbangers to be killed.

They handed over a hatemonger.

Their actions led to three people
being killed.

And a woman being sexually assaulted
in front of her 1 0-year-old son.

- They couldn't have foreseen that.
- They conspired to kill a man...

...and then tried to cover it up.

They're victims. My group won't let
this department turn them into martyrs.

I thought martyrs
are what brought in the donations...

...and got your name in the papers.

I'll see they don't spend
one day in jail.

They probably won't.

I should get going.

Can I give you a lift?

No, I got one.
Thanks for the offer, though.

Offer's always good.

Sir, do you have a minute?

Sorry. I missed dinner.
What can I do for you?

I don't think that Julien and I are
turning out to be a good match.

- Really?
- I just think he might be better off...

...with a different training officer.
Finnegan's not riding with anyone.

- I could take the next candidate.
- Julien's going through a tough time.

He needs you now more than ever.

You're as good as we have.

You'll work things out.

- How could you do this?
- It was a mistake.

We were gonna use the coke
for an undercover bust.

I didn't do the paperwork.
When it got stolen with the truck...

- Is that what you plan on telling IAD?
- Come on, what do they have?

- A car thief as a witness? Please.
- She's convincing.

Plus, there's the officer who saw you
take the stuff in the first place.

They've established chain of custody.
From you to the truck to the OD victim.

Shane was the one in possession
of the drugs.

- He's the one that got the truck stolen.
- Ben, no!

I don't have the juice anymore
to protect all of you.

Shane had the drugs.
We lay it all on his doorstep.

It's either that or you two
can share a cell.

You don't have to like it,
but it's time to serve him up.

- I was just about to close.
- What was Sally's message?

- She says not to give up.
- I haven't.

She says you're the only one
still fighting for her.

What else did she say?

You have something for me?

An IAD file of a current investigation
my people are trying to cover up.

Dirty cops? Why give it to me?

You'll see it gets the publicity
it deserves.

And if you leak it to the press,
it'd look self-serving.

You want it or not?

Of course.

Don't worry, David. I'll make sure
they spell your name right.

That's my book.

The reason I have it is because
Matthew has autism.

- We found out a few weeks ago.
- Oh, Jesus.

- Oh, Vic. Vic, I'm sorry.
- It's been tough. Lot of work.

You know, the one thing
I've learned is...

...I goddamn love that kid
more now than ever.

Hey, he's got problems, you know...

...but I'm never giving up on him.

I'm not giving up
on you either, Shane.

I'm gonna have to get a little creative
on this "past job experience" section.

Creative's cool. Just don't lie.

Though I might need a few glasses
of wine to get that creative.

Let me just skip on down here to the...

What's this?
References. References.

It wouldn't hurt to have a glowing one
from a respected city police officer.

- What, you're not gonna help me out?
- I can't.

Unbelievable.

Good enough to suck,
but not good enough to vouch for.

That's not it.

I know. You won't even come out
to my perspective employer.

- What kind of lie is that?
- I can't.

I'm just not ready to tell anyone.
The people in my life... I can't.

- You said you were trying.
- I am.

- No, you're not.
- I am.

Do you know what it takes for me
to keep coming back here?

I mean, I was taught...
I was told to believe things.

In spite of those beliefs, I keep
coming back here night after night...

...because I care about you.

See?

I'm trying.

Just being here is trying.

Police.

Tomas Motyashik?

You have an open warrant
for your arrest.

Let's go.

Don't worry.

Your boyfriend'll lock up.

Won't you, officer?

Previously on The Shield:

- Got a double homicide in the Grove.
- It took you over an hour to show up.

- Where's the police? Where are you?
- Someone leaked the 91 1 tapes.

- Shit.
- We got a situation brewing.

I know you're angry.
This is a serious problem.

Wouldn't be no problem
in Beverly Hills.

I was in a hit-and-run tonight.

Tony!

I go to check on him and his buddy
took shots at me.

- That's his buddy. He shot at me.
- Good friends to have, Jesus.

- Yeah, if I keep quiet.
- You call me anytime.




- Jesus Christ! What did you do?
- Nothing you haven't done.

When were you gonna tell me
you're shagging a Latina?

- I didn't wanna get her involved.
- Who is she?

- Sedona Tellez.
- Sedona Tellez is listed as a CEO...

...of a corporation based in the Grand
Cayman Islands. Its sole purpose?

Buying up real estate
here in Farmington.

You've been manipulating police
resources to crash land value?

Your mistress has been buying up
property in this area like Disney.

- She never checked into the bungalow.
- Another lie?

- Maybe he stashed her someplace.
- Or slashed her.

I'm gonna miss dinner tonight.

- But Ben's already here.
- Gilroy's there?

- What are you doing at my house?
- You should've left Sedona out of it.

Pack bags for you and the kids.
You're not staying here.




- What? This is our house.
- It isn't safe.

The police department is ordering
you to disperse.

The men are coming under
increased attack.

It's time to pull back
or turn them loose.

I wish I knew.

Send them in.

I'm getting reports of a casualty.

Civilian. Female.

Rescue standing by outside,
affirmative.

- One Tango 1 3, respond.
- Connor and Adelaide.

- One Tango 1 3 responding.
- One Tango 1 9 responding also.

Hey, wait a minute. This is our call.

It's a crazy night out here.
You might need backup.

Hit the lights. Go around the park.
Don't let them beat us there.

- Keep them comfortable and calm.
- You got it.

- You mind sleeping on the couch?
- Hell, no. I've had worse.

- Cool. Just lay low until I find Gilroy.
- Okay.

- They're all asleep.
- Good.

You wanna tell me
why my children are in danger?

- They're not.
- Why are we living like refugees?

- I have to find out a few things.
- I wanna go home.

- We can't.
- Why not? What've you done?

What are you mixed up in? This
doesn't happen to other cops' families.

What are you doing that's worth
making us go into hiding?

I just need the four of you
to stay here. All right?

- We should've taken Caravelle.
- We'd still be at the park if you had.

- Guess we'll never know.
- Hey, was that a false alarm or what?

Oh, my God!

Officer down! One Tango 1 3!
Officer down! Rudy!

- Paula?
- He's dead.

- What?
- Up.

Come on.

Come on.

- Get down!
- There's more than one of them!

Up there!

They're gone.

Paula.

Paula.

- What happened?
- Someone made a bogus 91 1 call.

When the units responded,
they opened fire.

Thanks, Chris.

Who got hit?

Rudy's dead.

Paula's bad but has a chance. Danny
and Julien were there. They're okay.

Is this because of the dead women
who got stood up by 91 1?

- Yeah, looks like it.
- I want a shot at the SOB who did this.

Get in line.

Line starts here.

Hey. How you doing?

They killed him,
and Paula's really hurt.

I know.

We traced the 91 1 call
to a cell phone.

Who's it registered to?

Police! On the ground, asshole!

- Hey, hey, hold up.
- Don't move!

Hey. All right. Nobody shoot, man!

- Where's your cell phone?
- I don't know. Maybe I lost it.

You hear about the cops
that got shot, Cyrus?

- Your cell was used to lure them there.
- I say I lost my cell.

Why don't you tell us for the third time
you got no idea how?

Don't get all surly with me.

Ain't a crime to lose your cell phone.

Hey, Dutch. You still on top
of this hit-and-run thing?

Yeah.

Any luck on the whereabouts
of our driver's girlfriend?

- You kept insisting it's a waste of time.
- What? You want me to say it?

Maybe I was wrong.
What do you got?

Sedona Tellez used to work in
accounting for the department.

- What, our department?
- Yeah. Down at headquarters.

Two months into the job she's buying
up Farmington property with this...

...Cayman Islands shell company.
- Did you cut through the paper trail?

All the land transactions went through
the same escrow company.

- Did you talk to them?
- Without a warrant, they won't let me.

How about letting me
take a shot at it?

Really?

I just wanna keep my fingers busy till
we find out if this guy's gonna crack.

Gilroy's not at home or his office.
The guy's a goddamn ghost.

- He's gotta be somewhere.
- Who knows where he'll be next?

Your house again? My house?

We have to find him
before he finds us.

- Maybe he's hiding with the mistress.
- Oh, come on. He killed her.

- We don't know that.
- He threatened your family.

Brings up Terry dying.
He's taking his last breaths.

Will you stop making threats
and start helping me find the guy?

Now, dig in.

When did we start catching guys
by diving into financial records?

If Gilroy's gonna cash in on these
deals, he needs the girl's signature.

When we find this Sedona,
we find him.

Though I walk through
the midst of trouble...

...your hand will revive me.

- You will stretch out...
- Ready?

- Sorry.
- It's all right. I'm...

- You're shaking.
- No. I'm...

Julien, look, it's okay to be scared.

It is. I mean, you were almost
in a situation...

I almost lost my partner last night.

I'm just thankful.

Yeah, me too.

- This isn't the first phone you've lost.
- Excuse me?

I've talked to seven
wireless companies.

You've either had a phone lost or
cloned by each and every one of them.

- Always on the first of the month.
- Bill time.

You sell the phone to some grifter.
You wait a few days, report it missing.

Meanwhile, half of Union Station
is calling up Guatemala.

Or 91 1. That makes you
a felony accomplice.

Wait a minute, man. All I could tell you
is who I sell the phones to.

I wouldn't get mixed up
in no cop killings or nothing like that.

I mean, you guys
are the real heroes out there, right?

- Stop kissing ass and give us a name.
- His name is lgal.

- He's one of those Jews.
- Those Jews?

He's not American Jew. He's a real
Jew from Jerusalem or something.

- There's been another 91 1 shooting.
- What?

They got Patrick and Chris.
They're both dead.

- You see that?
- They took his badge.

Chris' too.

Jesus.

You know one of these vultures
saw something useful.

Wanna try the smoke-out?

Yeah.

Excuse me. Detective Vendrell.

Had reports someone
witnessed a crime or the perpetrator.

- What report?
- There wasn't one.

A woman was here when it
occurred. She didn't see the crime...

...but she did see another witness.
She'll be down here in a few minutes...

...to identify you, so you may as well
come forward right now.

You, stop! Stop right there!

Stop!

Don't make me shoot you, asshole!

Stop!

- All right, you start talking!
- I didn't do nothing, man.

All right. Fine.

You're not a witness, then you're
an arrest, and this is just enough...

...to make you a trafficker.
- You can't do that.

What? Bust drug dealers?
You just made my quota for the week.

- Come on!
- Okay, look, man, I'll tell you.

- You just gotta get that rock off me.
- The whole truth first.

All right, look. I heard shots, man.

I see two cops go down, then someone
go over and mess with the body.

- Who?
- There was three of them, man.

- Blacks?
- Yeah, two brothers and a sister, man.

Now, can you take the dope with you?
Please, man. Come on, man.

Secure the areas before going in.

- Our artist just finished.
- How many copies did you run?

- Five thousand.
- Make it 1 0.

I'll talk to my contacts on the street.
Someone's gotta know these guys.

No one talks to the press but me.

I want every off-duty officer scrambled
and in this building within 45 minutes.

Wagenbach, why are you
sitting there?

I'm working a hit-and-run.

Well, stop. We got cops bleeding in
the streets. Half the district's on fire.

There's no other case. You and
Claudette will run the investigation.

- I was handling this personally.
- Not anymore.

Are you shitting me with this?

You had command of the riot squad
and a lady got trampled to death.

The shootings last night, I stayed out
of it, and now I got two more dead.

- I can't afford your leadership now.
- We're making progress.

Not enough. If you wanna cry
to the chief, give him a call.

But do it downstairs, because
I'm taking over your office.

Pete, I need the case file,
duty roster...

...and a cup of coffee,
not too much cream.

Pete, could you wait for a minute
outside, please?

Stay close in case
I need you, though.

- What do you want, Vic?
- You threatened my family.

If I wanted to hurt them, I could've.

You kept digging into Sedona and our
land deals. I was just refocusing you.

You know what you did.

- You know what I'm gonna have to do.
- You're not doing anything.

Not now. But soon.

You think I'd take you on
without insurance?

Trust me, I got something on you.

You bastard.

You hit that kid,
come begging to me for help?

- Call me "friend"?
- Stop chasing after me and Sedona.

Do what you do best.
Find these cop killers.

Okay, friend?

Pete!

Get me Donald Graham
on the phone.

I wanna get some of the Southside
boys here until we catch these pricks.

That's all for now.

Gilroy's really got you
spinning, huh?

I mean, blame this whole mess
on you and then yank you off it.

We get these guys, he's the hero.
Either way, you're the goat.

Guess you can kiss that
City Council seat goodbye.

- You here to pile on?
- No. I'm here to help.

What if I told you there was a way to
flip things around, make you the hero?

Maybe even put your
political career on track.

- How?
- Help me take down a dirty cop.

Gilroy diverted police units from
that part of town so crime would rise...

...and he could buy property
at a discount?

Led to the murder of those two women,
the riots, the cop shootings.

When he killed that kid
in the hit-and-run with his mistress...

...he was afraid it'd get out.

If that's true, why don't you
go upstairs and arrest him?

Because I can't prove it.

This land deal is a paper-trail
nightmare. I can't begin to crack it.

Your smarts, you could.

You're flattering me,
so this must be a setup.

It's not.

- Gilroy's bad.
- You can't get him on the hit-and-run?

He had the car fixed.

And one of the witnesses
was already killed in a gang hit.

What about the woman in the car?

Sedona Tellez.

Gilroy's mistress is the key. Find her,
she can give him up for the land deal...

...and the hit-and-run.
- Find her yourself.

- Gilroy wants me out on the street.
- And why should I do all your legwork?

Because when I find
these cop shooters...

...l'll let you bring them in.

That way you get the credit
for taking down Gilroy and them.

Sounds like a nice headline to me.

A little too nice. I don't know
what trap you've set...

I don't expect you to trust me.

But I know you're too curious...

...not to check in on it.

Trying to put AT&T
out of business, lgal?

No. I'm just trying to get by.

Each and every one of these phones
is either stolen or cloned.

I am as shocked as you are
to discover that.

I bet. Did you sell phones
to any of these kids?

- I don't know. What did they do?
- They killed three police officers...

...and put the fourth in a hospital.
- What? No.

- These are them?
- Yeah.

And they used your phones
to lure them there.

- No. This is horrible. I have no idea.
- So you did sell phones to them?

One each. Yesterday.

Please, tell me how I can help
you to catch these monsters.

- Give us the numbers of the phones.
- Of course, of course.

Now.

We were at Patrick's kid's party
weeks ago.

- I know.
- Jesus!

Let's hit south of Olympic. I'm giving
a reward to whoever ID's these three.

- How're my kids?
- Good. I rented them a PlayStation.

- Thanks.
- Hey, call Corrine. She's not thrilled.

- Okay. Call me if you find out anything.
- All right. Let's get them! Come on.

- Hey, it's me.
- When are we going home?

- I don't know. Hopefully a day or two.
- Day or two? Are you okay?

- Yes.
- Then what's going on?

I got things coming at me from every
direction. I don't need more problems.

What's happening to this family is the
problem, and you won't tell me why.

Just do nothing.

That's all I'm asking you to do. Just sit
there and do nothing. Is that so hard?

- I'm not your prisoner.
- Look, I'll tell you when it's safe.

Don't bother.

What's up, dog?

Tio! You're out early.

People's nerves are shot.
They need an escape.

Yeah, well, killing brain cells is fine.
Killing cops ain't. Let's go. Showtime.

Know anything about
these 91 1 shootings?

A lot of people think the cops
had it coming.

- I say we need to work with the police.
- Glad you feel that way.

- I need a line on these guys.
- I hear something...

Not good enough. You're gonna
go out looking, be my eyes and ears.

Something happens,
you'll be my feet and hands too.

You'll have to get
off your corner and get involved.

- Shitheads sometimes brag about this.
- They do, we need to know.

- I'll get involved, see who's talking.
- You do that.

Yes. I wanted information on some
escrow accounts at your company.

Well, who can release
that information?

Good. Now, call him at home and tell
him that Captain David Aceveda's...

...about to show up there
with 1 0 officers and a subpoena...

...if he isn't on the phone with me
in about 30 seconds.

- Yes, I'll hold.
- You got a minute, David?

- Yes, sir.
- Listen...

...l'm sorry if I was hard
on you earlier.

- Nerves get raw at a time like this.
- Yes, they do.

And I know how bent up you are
about being pushed aside here...

...but I got something that might
help take the pain away.

Really?

You've always tried to warn me
about Vic.

But until recently,
I figured he meant well.

- Now I'm not so sure.
- What are you talking about?

There was a dead kid the other day.
Jesus something.

It got written down as a gang hit.

I've got a source, though,
says it was Mackey.

- What?
- I know how badly you've wanted him.

And he has a lot of friends
who don't wanna see him hang.

You're the only one
I can trust with this.

Get down!

Lock down the building!

- Hands up!
- Freeze!

Let's see some hands!
See some hands!

- Throw your weapons outside the car!
- You're just gonna kill us.

- I got a clean shot, captain.
- No. No shots until I give the word.

Copycats?

They're Latino, not blacks.
Everyone in the neighborhood...

...feels like they can take
a free shot now.

Nice job.

That thing we were talking about.

- You interested?
- Mackey?

- Very.
- Good.

Let's talk.

Heard about some punk flashing
a cop's badge like it was a souvenir.

Talking about how he started shooting
and the cops ran like bitches.

- Know where this asshole lives?
- His old man's a heavy biter.

- All loused up.
- Great.

Dad's busy mainlining
and junior's a cop killer.

I doubt Mom's Betty Crocker.
Thanks for the fast info.

Police!

Don't move!

- Jesus Christ!
- What do you guys want?

- We're looking for your boy.
- Sonny? He ain't here.

- Where's your kid?
- I don't know.

Well, you better remember,
or you're gonna be visiting Jonestown.

In a brightly lit, cold cage.

I can get my boy down here,
but, like, what's in it for me?

I still got one vein working.

How much do you need, porcupine?

Two Tango 1 3, 9 1 1 call.
Woman caller reports she's dying.

88 1 1 Lorraine.

That's three blocks from last night.

- Got yours on?
- Absolutely.

All right.

You call for the police?

In here!

Police in the house.

You got here!

What's wrong, ma'am?

Well, my daughter left
and I need to take my medicine.

- What medicine?
- For arthritis. It's over there.

You called us for your
arthritis medicine?

In the brown bottle over there.
Hand it to me.

- Ma'am, 91 1 is for emergencies.
- Well, this is emergency to me.

- How many?
- Two.

- What?
- Would it kill you to get me water?

Hey, boy. Where you at?

Mama's here.

Yeah. She got Jesus now.

She looks good.

She can't wait to see you.

Okay. All right, son.

He's on his way.

Yes, sir...

One of the phones lgal sold just got
used to call an apartment in the Grove.

- Yes. Here we go.
- Okay, roll.

Mama?

What are you...?

Sorry, Sonny. I ain't your mama.

Look what we got here.

Looks nice.

This what you used
to kill my friends?

Oh, you cop-killing piece of shit!

- Who are the other shooters?
- Kiss my ass, man.

I can't tell you how much I was hoping
that's what your answer would be.

You wanna kill me, Sonny?

Wanna kill me?

- Who are the other shooters?
- Dad!

- Sorry.
- What are their names?

- Benji and Twanya.
- Where can I find them?

We were gonna find some
abandoned building to squat in.

What part of town?

Near the Groves.

- Police! Search warrant!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

- Whoa, it's just us!
- We already got him.

What do we got?

- He's one of our cop killers.
- He was stabbing me with that badge.

Asshole.

You look fine to me.

I'm listening.

First you want me to shut up,
now you want me to talk?

How many personalities
you got, lady?

Walking around
pretending to be a man.

- I know what you really are.
- You don't know nothing.

I know that leg's shaking.

Why'd you do it?

Three officers dead.

How many more lives
you plan on ruining?

More the merrier.

Bang.

It is...

...everything in me...

...not to slap you silly.

- Come on.
- No freebies, girl. Now, step off.

- Screw your mother in the ass, Tio.
- Already did twice this morning, bitch.

- Tio, I need another favor.
- You're as bad as her.

- How much money you got?
- A few thou.

Give it to me. I gotta grease a few
wheels. I left my play money at home.

- Come on.
- Can't say I ain't paying my dues.

No, I can't.

Talk to every Boxcar Willie
and bag lady you see.

If our shooters are squatting,
I wanna know where.

- Looks like it'll be raining Jim Beam.
- Make it Thunderbird, it'll go farther.

I'm Sedona Tellez. I heard
there's a problem with the closing...

...on one of my properties.
- Actually, there's not.

Sedona.
I'm Captain David Aceveda.

- Have we met before?
- No.

But I've got lots of questions.

Very nice. Quite a step up
from your place in Farmington.

I've done well lately.

Thanks to your corporation
in the Caymans.

That's quite the shell game.

If you were going to arrest me,
you would've taken me in.

Not back to my place.

Sure you don't want a drink?

How does it work,
this land scheme of yours?

I speculate real estate. It's no scheme
and it's not against the law.

Unless your boyfriend keeps
police resources from there...

...so it stays a slum,
so you could buy it cheap.

Boyfriend?

Then he pours resources back in,
cleans it up...

...and you get to sell your properties
for a killing.

Wow, I should've thought of that.

I'm sure you did.
Seems a bit complicated for Gilroy.

I don't know a Gilroy.

You worked in his office for two
months. I bet you showed him...

...how to park pension funds into your
account to make your purchases.

Yeah.
I made a few calls this afternoon.

Now, let's talk about
your boyfriend's hit-and-run.

- I understand your anger.
- You don't know me.

Your father's a heroin addict,
your mother left when you were 9.

Am I missing
any of the broad strokes?

The two women who were murdered
across the street from you.

Did you know them?

- Saw them sometimes.
- Is that what this is all about?

Revenge?

- No, no.
- What, then? Just for kicks?

Deal with it.

You murdered three of my people.

Twanya knew the women good.
They looked after her.

Benji and me figured the three of us
should do something about it.

The police didn't kill those women.
Wally Forton did.

They called 91 1.

- You all took an hour to show up.
- So you kill three people?

Just cops.

Just like you all killed those ladies.

I don't care how right
you think you are.

I don't care what kind of bad life
you had. What you did was wrong.

It's as wrong as it gets.

Vic, this is Sedona Tellez.

- I've been looking for you.
- I've been right here.

She has a lot of interesting things
to say about our assistant chief.

So much for loyalty, huh, lady?

Ben's in love. I have a future.

Gilroy's not the only one
she implicates.

- Meaning?
- Meaning I was wondering...

...what your trap was
and now I know.

You didn't think I'd find out
about the murder?

- What murder?
- Jesus Rosales.

The witness to Gilroy's hit-and-run.

- That was a gang hit.
- Are you in a gang now?

What, is she saying I killed Jesus?

She says a cop buddy cleaned it all up
for Gilroy. I wonder who that is.

- Not me.
- You wanted me to take down Gilroy...

...before he could take you down.
You're both filthy in this.

Hey, I had nothing to do
with killing that Rosales kid.

So if I checked out your place
I wouldn't find the murder weapon.

- No way in hell.
- All right. Let's find out.

This is a search warrant
for your place.

Gilroy thinks we'll find something.

Ben...

Ben was at my house yesterday.
I thought he was there...

He must've planted the gun there.

And why would Gilroy have a murder
weapon to an unsolved gang hit?

Because he killed Jesus.

- Oh, you are just full of surprises.
- I was in the room when he did it.

I found him. If I said anything,
it would've looked liked I was in on it.

And we all know
how squeaky clean you are.

- Gilroy had you get this warrant?
- That's right.

This warrant is six hours old.
You haven't searched my house?

I talked Gilroy into letting you
catch these cop killers first.

And then we're moving on you.

Yeah.

Hold on, hold on.

Okay, I got it.

Good.

That was Lem.

They know where
the other two shooters are.

Now...

...are you gonna help
Gilroy frame me?

Or are you gonna go with me
and nail these bastards?

You sure the shooter's inside?

- Thunderbird did the trick.
- Couple squatters ID'd them.

Said the guy told them to get lost,
waved a gun around.

Good.

Now, stay close.

I know what I'm doing.

All right, ladies.

They wanna come peacefully, fine.

If not, they killed Rudy,
Patrick and Chris.

Hey, asshole.
One more inch and you're dead!

Now, put your hands on your head!

Okay.

Okay, it's cool. It's cool, it's cool.

Vic!

Don't! Get down on your knees!
Get down!

Hands on your head!
I'm not gonna tell you again!

- Everyone all right?
- Yeah. We got it.

Great work, David.

You got that warrant for Vic's place?

Right here.

You ready to serve it?

He caught three cop killers, cleaned
up your mess, and you can just...

...stab him in the back.
- My mess?

I practically choked
digging through the shit.

- Mackey's just covering his ass.
- The land schemes? The hit-and-run?

You gonna try laying those
at his door too?

Don't come near this, David.
Especially without any proof.

Everyone's gonna know
what you did.

Last time. Don't play with fire.

Get out of my office.

If you won't serve this,
I'll find someone who will.

You're fired.

- Anything?
- No.

Check the den again.

- Nothing in Matthew's room.
- Check the garage.

This gun is nowhere.

- I found it!
- What?

- I found it! I found it.
- Where'd you find it?

It was in the central air vent
in Cassidy's room.

Still loaded.

Sedona!

Come on, we gotta go!

Hi, Ben.

I figured you'd be at your place.

Looking for this, right?

Sit down, you prick.

It was just some insurance, Vic.

Yeah?

You should've taken out
life insurance.

Vic, please.

You planted a murder weapon
in my house.

A loaded gun in my little girl's room.

- She wouldn't have found it.
- I found it.

- Oh, you are so over, man.
- Vic...

I'm really sorry about all this.
I mean...

...there's a way out.
- Shut up, you goddamn drunk!

Vic, just drop me and Sedona off
across the border.

We got some money. We'll disappear.
You'll never hear from me again.

I can't let you walk away
from this, Ben.

I'd be giving up my job, my life.

We got a different price tag
in mind.

Oh, yeah?

- Then kill me!
- You damn right.

Well, come on already!

Just kill me, Vic. Go ahead.

But don't act like
you're better than me.

What things have you done?

What've you done,
then covered those things up?

- I'm not like you.
- Not yet.

Not ever.

If you really believe that,
pull the goddamn trigger!

Do it, man.

Come on, it's time, man. Do it.

Well, you're such a saint.

Pull the trigger.

Look, it's all right, man.

It's all right. You two got history.
It's not easy.

Okay?

All right. Let me do it.
Let me do this for you, Vic.

Please, Vic.

Looks like it's starting to work.

Us.

Yeah.

Of course, you never ask me
about my stuff.

I'm always trying to get you
to open up, but you never pry.

Why is that?

You wanna talk?

You will.

I'll wait outside,
we'll walk out together?

Sure.

Boss, went by the hotel.
Your family's gone, man.

- What?
- They're gone!

Two of the shooters have been
detained, the other is dead.

Captain, can you comment on the
arrest of Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy?

The facts will show that
Assistant Chief Gilroy chose a path...

...that led to tragic circumstances
for the city.

Corrine!

Cassidy!

It's me. I'm really tired.
I don't know where we're going, but...

I know you'll wanna find us...

... but if you still have love for me,
you won't try...

... for a while, anyway.

I'm sorry.

I can't comment at this time
until we have more information.

- One more follow-up question.
- There you are.

- I'm a sucker for a good show.
- Well, for us the show's over.

Husband shot his wife
because she lost his car keys.

He's already in custody.
Wanna pick up some food on the way?

Are you dragging me to that
Chinese place again?

- I got a thing for egg rolls tonight.
- You got it every night.

How about spareribs, roast beef,
anything else?

Oh, no.

Oh, that's okay. Okay.

Oh, God!

Goddamn it!

Do these arrests put you in the front-
running for the City Council elections?

In my experience, people hate being
told who to vote for. I wouldn't...

...declare me the winner quite yet.

I've enjoyed my underdog status
up till now.

No...

But today's events can't hurt, right?

Let's focus on what today's events
really mean.

Three officers gave their lives
in defense of an institution...

...that their boss betrayed
for personal gain.

It's a scandal and an outrage.

The curse of corruption
has left its mark on this department.

Now we start the difficult task
of healing.
