1 
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,875 
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PAST, 
PRESENT AND FUTURE 
 
2 
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,916 IS ONLY A STUBBORNLY 
PERSISTENT ILLUSION. ALBERT EINSTEIN 
 
3 
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:30,416 We trust that time is linear. 
 
                 4 00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:38,125 
That it proceeds eternally, uniformly. 
 
5 
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,500 Into infinity. 
 
6 
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:49,833 
But the distinction between past, present 
 
7 
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,666 and future 
 
8 
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,833 is nothing but an illusion. 
 
9 
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:02,791 
Yesterday, today and tomorrow are not consecutive, 
 
10 
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:09,125 they are connected 
in a never-ending circle. 
 
11 
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:14,708 Everything is connected.

SECRETS 
 
15 
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:49,375 
NOVEMBER 4, 2019 
 
16 
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,833 Fuck. 
 
17 
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,416 Mom. 
 
18 
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,041 Mom! 
 
19 
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,125 
       You'd think by 16, they'd know how to make toast. 
 
20 
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,166 Mom! 
 
21 
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,083 The power's out again. 
 
22 
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,583 Mom! 
 
23 
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,375 Thanks for breakfast. 
 
                24 00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,916 
Coming to the meeting tonight? 
 
25 
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,833 I don't know. 
 
26 
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,916 -Katharina will be there. 
-And I'll be there. 
 
27 
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,666 Yes, you'll be there. 
 
28 
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,208 That's right. 
 
29 
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:11,833 Ulrich. 
 
30 
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,750 I love you. 
 
31 
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,583 You're beautiful. 
 
32 
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,791 
MISSING 
 
33 
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,125 
WINDEN CAVES 0.6 MILES 
 
34 
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:17,708 How was it? 
 
                       35 00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,250 How have you been these last two months? 
 
36 
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,916 
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want. 
 
37 
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,666 
       I read the notes from your therapy sessions. 
 
38 
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,500 
        You did pretty good, especially in the group sessions. 39 
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,458 I still see him. 
 
40 
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,041 In your dreams? 
 
41 
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,875 Why do you think you see him? 
 
                42 00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,958 
As my therapist, shouldn't you tell me? 
 
43 
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,541 Are you taking your meds? 
 
                44 00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,791 
I think he's trying to tell me something. 
 
45 
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,500 
Or maybe I just want him to tell me something. 
 
                46 00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,291 
What do you think that might be? 
 
47 
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,875 What do I think it might be? 
 
48 
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,541 Why? 
 
49 
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,833 Why he left? 
 
50 
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,083 Why like that? 
 
51 
 00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,166 Why he fucking hanged himself? 
 
52 
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,333 
And why he didn't leave a word? 
 
                53 00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,583 
Nothing to explain this fucking crap! 
 
54 
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,333 
DO NOT OPEN 
BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M. 
 
55 
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,541 
The Winden nuclear power plant has a long history. 
 
56 
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:04,625 
Plans to erect the nuclear power plant go back as far as 1953. 
 
57 
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:09,333 
Construction was first authorized in 1960 
after the Atomic Energy Act was passed. 
 
58 
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:13,875 
As part of the government's staggered plan to phase out nuclear energy, 
 
59 
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:18,000 the Winden power plant 
will be taken off the grid in 2020, 
 
60 
      00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:22,958 making it one of Germany's power plants 
with the longest failure-free operation. 
 
61 
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,250 
                  Mikkel, you're not going to school like that. 
 
                62 00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,500 
A good magician needs a distinctive style. 
 
63 
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,583 
Change your clothes. Thank you. 
64 
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,458 These are my work clothes. 
 
65 
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,500 And school sucks! 
 
                66 00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,791 
I'm sure the great Hodini went to school. 
 
67 
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,375 -Houdini! It's not that hard! 
-Come have breakfast. 
 
68 
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,458 
-The greatest magician ever. 
-Are you sure he's not adopted? 
 
                69 00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,333 
-And his name is Houdini! 
-Same crap every morning. 
 
70 
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,250 Mom, where's my black hoodie? 
 
                71 00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,208 
I don't know. Maybe with the jackets. 
 
72 
  00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,166 Magnus, stop trampling like that! 
 
                73 00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,083 
-Morning, Mikkel. 
-Good morning. 
 
74 
  00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,333 Ulrich! Why did it take so long? 
 
75 
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,458 
First day of school. 
A huge line at the bakery. 
 
76 
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,333 
The Apocalypse is upon us. 
You coming to eat? 
 
77 
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,041 It's not with the jackets. 
 
78 
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,291 Ouch! 
 
                 79 00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:14,375 -Then maybe it's in your gym bag. 
-What's going on here now? Magnus? 
 
                 80 00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,125 
-Breakfast. 
-Mom, I'm on hunger strike. 
 
81 
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,916 
I won't stuff my face as long as a child starves to death every ten seconds. 
 
82 
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,166 I will. 
 
                83 00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,750 
The damn hoodie isn't in the bag. 
 
                84 00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,541 
-Did you steal my hoodie? 
-No, I did not! 
 
                85 00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:34,208 -Can't you stop arguing for once? 
-Mom, I didn't do anything. 
 
                86 00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,625 
-Where can it be? 
-Can I please have my lines back? 
 
87 
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,291 
Magnus, maybe it's up in the laundry. 
                88 00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,458 
Martha, starving won't help anyone. 
 
                89 00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,166 
Mikkel, get changed now. Last warning! 
 
                90 00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,666 
-Or we'll be late. 
-Whose idea was it to have kids? 
 
                91 00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,500 
-Can you please open this? 
-You're in the way! 
 
92 
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,291 Did you understand me? 
 
93 
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,166 All right then, Houdini. 
 
                94 00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,916 
One last trick, then off to school. 
 
                95 00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,583 
Fine, then everyone can do as they wish. 
 
96 
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,291 Found it! 
 
97 
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:13,875 Okay. 
 
98 
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:15,791 There... 
 
99 
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,375 and there. 
 
100 
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,666 Amazing! How did you do that? 101 
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,083 
Dad, the question isn't how, 
 
102 
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,208 the question is when. 
 
103 
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,666 Hey! 
 
104 
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,666 Welcome back to the madhouse. 
 
                   105 00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,583 
It was damn boring without you here. 
 
                   106 00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,000 -Hey, what the hell are you staring at? 
-What a freak. 
 
107 
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,833 What idiots. 
 
108 
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,000 Did you tell anyone? 
 
109 
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,833 
          I told everyone you were on a two-month school exchange in France, 
 
110 
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,083 playing hide-the-baguette. 
 
111 
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,166 Relax. Come on. 
 
112 
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,291 It'll be fine. Let's go. 
 
113 
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,208 Come on. 
                114 00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,625 
-What about here? 
-You didn't miss much. 
 
                115 00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,541 
Except for the thing with Erik. 
 
116 
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,666 You don't give a shit! 
 
117 
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,041 Why is nobody doing anything? 
Where is our son? Where is Erik? 
 
118 
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,791 Mr. Obendorf. 
 
                119 00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,875 
No one is unimportant to us here. 
We've done 172 interviews. 
 
120 
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,500 
We've questioned neighbors and friends, combed the entire forest, 
 
121 
  00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,375 searched the houses and basements of nearby residents. 
 
122 
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,583 
23 officers and over 50 volunteers 
 
123 
        00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,625 have been searching for your son for days. 
 
124 
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,791 
We're doing our job. 
And we'll do it better if you calm down. 
 
                125 00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,166 
-You're not doing shit! 
-Hey! 
 
126 
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,291 
Calm down! 
Stop. Calm down now. 
 
127 
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,875 Hey! Come now. 
 
128 
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,791 Listen. 
 
129 
  00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,541 We can't rule out the possibility that no crime has been committed. 
 
                130 00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,916 
-What's that supposed to mean? 
-Maybe Erik left voluntarily. 
 
131 
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,250 He's done it before. 
 
132 
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,416 
        But when he ran away, he always came back after two days. 
 
                      133 00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,000 -He'd sleep in the basement or wherever. 
-It's been 13 days. 
 
134 
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,875 It's been 13 days now. 
 
135 
 00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,208 We'll find your son, I promise. 
 
136 
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,833 Now go home. Okay? 
 
137 
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,625 Go home. 
138 
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,458 Franziska. 
 
139 
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,083 Magnus. 
 
                140 00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,375 
Shouldn't you be with the geeks? 
 
141 
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,541 
       Should the principal's son be smoking a joint on school grounds? 
 
142 
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,083 Especially such bad weed. 
 
                143 00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:15,750 
Assemblies like this are for idiots. 
They need to get rid of them. 
 
144 
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,291 Maybe you did miss something. 
 
145 
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,125 Hey. 
 
146 
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,041 Hey. 
 
147 
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,791 How was France? 
 
148 
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,208 French. How else? 
 
                149 00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,916 
What a nice welcome. Thank you. 
 
150 
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,375 
The reason I've asked you 
to assemble here before class 
 
151 
   00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:13,041 is because I wanted to talk to you 
about something important. 
 
152 
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,916 About Erik Obendorf. 
 
153 
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,750 
You all know Erik has been missing for almost two weeks now. 
 
154 
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,583 
           I want to tell you that if you need to talk to someone, 
 
155 
    00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,666 if you have questions or if you know anything about Erik's disappearance, 
 
156 
 00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,416 you can come to us at any time. 
 
157 
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,375 Come to us, talk to us. 
 
                158 00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,791 
There can be no secrets in this matter. 
 
159 
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,875 Okay? 
 
                160 00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,416 
No one saw him after practice. 
Not a trace, nothing. 
 
                161 00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,166 
-As if he vanished into thin air. 
-Maybe he just doesn't want to be found. 
 
162 
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,625 
The money under the bed? His phone? 
You'd take that if you were running away. 
 
                163 00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,041 
Sometimes people just want to get away. 
 
164 
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,416 
 49 tire tracks on the road between the school and the residential area. 
 
165 
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,708 Two of them are from trucks. 
 
166 
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,875 
There are 21,312 vehicles registered in the district of Winden alone. 
 
                167 00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,958 
-That's all we have. 
-So we've got nothing at all. 
 
168 
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,833 Erik's father drives a van. 
 
                169 00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,125 
You don't think he's involved. 
 
                170 00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,083 
Why are you so certain Erik ran away? 
 
171 
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,125 This is Winden. 
 
                172 00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,791 
-Nothing ever happens here. 
-But that hasn't always been the case. 
 
                173 00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,000 
This has nothing to do with my brother. 
 
174 
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,333 Not a thing. 
 
175 
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,541 
           Oh, your mother called the emergency number again this morning. 
 
                176 00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,958 
Maybe you should pay her a visit. 
 
177 
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,166 
      Do you ever wonder where you took a wrong turn? 
 
178 
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,625 
Where your life became the exact opposite of what you always wanted it to be? 
 
179 
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,791 
FOREST HOTEL WINDEN 
 
                180 00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,916 
Hotel Winden. Regina Tiedemann speaking. 
How can I help you? 
 
181 
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,291 
       I see, but surely there's something we can do. 
 
182 
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,250 
        Temporarily suspend the loan repayments, for example. 
 
183 
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,875 
    Just a slight deferment of payments until things have calmed down again here. 
 
184 
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,916 
I have not miscalculated. 
Are you even listening to me? 
 
185 
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,791 
Who wants to go on vacation in a town where a child has disappeared? 
 
186 
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,375 Would you want that? 
 
                187 00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,833 
I have a family suite available. 
 
                188 00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,083 
A weekend with the little ones? 
They'd love it, wouldn't they? 
 
189 
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,666 
You bankers sit on your piles of money and think you can bully people. 
 
                190 00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,875 
I've built up a business here. 
By myself. Without any help. 
 
191 
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,666 
      My husband and I have been customers of your bank for 20 years! 
 
192 
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,958 
And now you're pulling this? 
You stupid asshole! 
 
                193 00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,125 
I want to speak to your supervisor. 
 
194 
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,458 Hello? 
 
195 
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,458 Hello? 
 
196 
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,583 Shit, shit, shit! 
 
197 
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,875 
A black hole forms 
 
198 
    00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,916 when the center of a star collapses 
into itself after a supernova explosion. 
 
199 
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,791 
   Even new neutron matter cannot prevent the collapse. 
 
200 
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,375 
                You know what I've been wondering for days? 
 
201 
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:59,166 
      If the blackest hole of all is parked in Franziska Doppler's ass. 
 
202 
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,125 
        But, seriously, what I really wonder is this: 
 
203 
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:12,208 
          If Erik didn't run away, but got snuffed out or something instead, 
 
204 
       00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,458 then all his dope is still in the caves. 
 
                205 00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,833 
He kept his entire stash there. 
 
                206 00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,791 
-So? 
-Oh, man! 
 
207 
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,333 We go in there and... bingo! 
 
                208 00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,041 
-That's bullshit. 
-It's awesome. 
 
209 
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,291 
You haven't been here in a long time. 
 
210 
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,416 Where's Dad? 
 
211 
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,625 You could come by more often. 
 
212 
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:46,458 
     Mom, if you want me to stop by then call me, not the emergency number. 
 
                213 00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,958 
I saw something in the forest again. 
 
214 
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,000 This time very clearly. 
 
                215 00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,000 
A dark figure with a gigantic head. 
 
216 
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,833 Mom. 
 
217 
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,208 You don't believe me. 
 
218 
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,333 
There are things out there that our little minds 
 
219 
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,583 will never comprehend. 
 
220 
 00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,458 And I found this in the forest. 
 
221 
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,208 Mads loved those. 
 
222 
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,875 
This business with that missing Erik... 223 
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:32,916 
FOR MOTHER'S DAY 1986 
 
                224 00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,041 
...like with your brother, back then. 
 
                225 00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,750 
Everything's repeating itself. 
 
226 
 00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,791 Everything is just like it was 33 years ago. 
 
227 
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,791 
REST HOME WINDEN 
 
228 
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,666 It's going to happen again. 
 
229 
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,000 It's going to happen again. 
 
230 
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,208 It's going to happen again. 
 
231 
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,833 
Bullshit. 
Then you'll go around selling it or what? 
 
232 
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,000 
No, dude. 
We'll smoke half of it ourselves. 
 
233 
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,333 
And if there are capacities on the market, you don't hesitate. 
 
234 
  00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,500 We'll go there and get the stuff. 
 
235 
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,041 Easy peasy. 
 
236 
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,041 Who's getting what stuff? 
 
                237 00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,083 
We're going to the caves tonight. 
 
238 
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,791 -You turning into boy scouts? 
-Bartosz thinks Erik's dope is there. 
 
239 
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:10,125 
     Fanny told me they once found a dead squirrel with five legs there. 
 
240 
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,041 You'll believe any old crap. 
 
241 
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,708 
Just because you can't see past your nose 
 
242 
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,666 doesn't mean 
there aren't things going on out there 
 
243 
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,916 that the nuclear power mafia 
keeps secret from the public. 
 
244 
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,625 Don't forget to breathe. 
 
245 
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,666 Franziska. 
 
246 
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,208 Magnus. 
 
247 
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,416 
-You got a crush on her now or what? -Shut up. 
 
                   248 00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,916 
-Hey, idiot. 
-Okay, what the hell. 
 
                   249 00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,791 -Let's go to the caves tonight and look. 
-Yeah, dude! 
 
250 
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,541 Come on. 
 
                 251 00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,666 Can't even hold out half a day? 
 
252 
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,666 Impossible. I'm dying. 
 
253 
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,458 You coming later? 
 
254 
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,708 I don't know. 
 
255 
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:03,625 Everyone will be there. 
 
256 
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,125 Gawking at me. 
 
257 
  00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,958 I'll be in Frankfurt this weekend for training, staying in a hotel. 
 
258 
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,625 And... 
 
                259 00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,041 
-Um... Yeah, I thought... 
-You thought? 
 
260 
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,500 
Don't think too long, 
 
261 
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,208 I have various candidates. 
 
                262 00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,750 
-See you later. -Maybe. 
 
263 
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500 Yes, right there. 
 
264 
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,000 It's totally knotted up. 
 
265 
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,666 It's supposed to rain later. 
 
266 
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,000 Scars sense that. 
 
                267 00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,625 
They can see into the future, so to speak. 
 
268 
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,041 
The tissue hardens 
 
269 
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,291 and cramps up. 
 
270 
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,666 Thanks. 
 
271 
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:53,875 
          Maybe the whole thing is getting to me more than I thought. 
 
272 
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,250 In a year, everything here is meant to come to an end. 273 
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:09,833 
Nearly 33 years ago to the day when I came to Winden. 
 
                274 00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,708 
I never thought it would end like this. 
 
                275 00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,333 
But there's a time for everything. 
 
276 
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:17,916 Yes. 
 
                277 00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,291 
There's a time for everything. 
 
                278 00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,625 
I'm sorry. About the thing with Michael. 
 
                279 00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,166 
How are you doing? How's Jonas? 
 
280 
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:36,041 Good. 
 
281 
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,500 We're good. 
 
                282 00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,583 
It's Hannah here. The power's out again. 
 
283 
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:48,083 
I mean, if you want us out of the house, then just say so. 
 
284 
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,375 
              Your grandson hasn't seen you in over three months. 
 
285 
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,083 
Do you think Michael wanted that? 
 
286 
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,541 That's sick. 
 
287 
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:56,041 You're sick. 
 
288 
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:24,083 
DO NOT OPEN 
BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M. 
 
289 
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,416 Hannah! 
 
290 
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,000 How nice. 
 
                291 00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,041 
We haven't seen each other for ages. 
 
292 
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,875 How are you? 
 
293 
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,500 Okay. 
 
                  294 00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,333 Yeah, well, you know... I'm okay. 
 
295 
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,666 Good. 
 
296 
   00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,375 Go inside. I'll be right in, okay? 
 
297 
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,333 Hi.  
298 
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,083 Hi. 
 
                299 00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,500 
Where are Bartosz and the others? 
 
300 
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,625 Late. As always. 
 
                301 00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:27,875 
-The thing with Bartosz... 
-It's okay. You don't need to explain. 
 
302 
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:30,875 But I want to. 
 
                303 00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,083 
I wrote you a text while you were away. 
 
304 
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,666 Not just one. 
 
305 
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,250 But I never sent them. 
 
306 
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:43,000 It all sounded wrong somehow. 
 
                307 00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,000 
What happened between us last summer... 
 
                308 00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,166 
-I... 
-It's really okay. 
 
309 
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:53,916 Something up? 
 
310 
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,916 I think I'm having déjà vu. 
 
311 
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,166 
The light, the forest. 
 
312 
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:04,500 
       As if all of this has already happened before. 
 
313 
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,000 A glitch in the matrix. 
 
314 
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:11,500 What? 
 
315 
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:15,083 
   If the world is a simulation, déjà vu is a glitch in the matrix. 
 
                316 00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,791 
Or a message from the other side. 
 
317 
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,958 I read that somewhere. 
 
318 
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:27,083 I'm glad you're back. 
 
                319 00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:34,666 
-Hey, what the hell? 
-Parents' meeting. 
 
320 
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,291 
Heide's got a stomach bug. 
I'm stuck with him. 
 
                321 00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,458 
Hi, Jonas. Ultimate fist bump? 
 
322 
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:41,291 Take him back now. 
 
                323 00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:44,250 
-You take him back. 
-Relax, guys. 
 
324 
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,500 I'm not a baby anymore. 
 
325 
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,750 What's the idiot doing here? 
 
326 
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,916 Only I can do that, okay? 
 
327 
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,875 Ouch! 
 
328 
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,250 Well, let's go! 
 
329 
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,375 It's going to happen again. 
 
330 
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,375 It's going to happen again. 
 
331 
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,333 It's going to happen again. 
 
332 
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,791 
       You all know that Erik has been missing for 14 days now. 
 
333 
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:28,250 
            At this point, we have no new findings to report. 
 
334 
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:32,333 
       We're also considering that he may have simply run away. 
 
335 
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:38,458 
           If any of your children say anything about Erik or know anything, 
 
336 
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,833 
please inform us. 
 
                337 00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,333 
-Thank you, Charlotte. 
-How long do you want to wait? 
 
338 
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:46,291 
  I'd like to talk about how we interact at school. 
 
339 
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,041 
    And about which measures we can take to boost security. 
 
340 
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,041 What kind of measures? 
 
341 
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:55,041 
You heard her say it's not clear that anything even happened. 
 
342 
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,333 
   But we can't rule anything out, including that Erik didn't run away. 
 
343 
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:01,083 
WILL BE OUTSIDE IN 5 MINUTES 
 
344 
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,916 This alarmist talk is absurd. 
 
345 
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:05,500 
Charlotte, correct me if I'm wrong, but in the region, 
 
                346 00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,166 
Winden has the lowest crime rate. 
 
347 
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,583 
There are no murderers running around here. 
 
348 
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:14,375 
-Statistics only give... 
-But we can't just sit and do nothing. 
 
349 
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,666 
And just wait around until Erik is found dead somewhere. 
 
                350 00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,583 
What do you guys think happened to Erik? 
 
351 
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:30,750 
          Kids in our class are saying someone kidnapped him, 
 
352 
    00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,250 and has him locked up in a basement. 
 
                353 00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,208 
Oh, shut up. He just ran away. 
 
354 
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:40,041 
But it could be that he's locked up somewhere and can't get out. 
 
355 
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:43,833 
Why would someone do that? 
Lock someone else up? 
 
356 
       00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:46,208 It's like the witch in Hansel and Gretel. 
 
357 
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,500 
  When she gets hungry, she has something to eat. 
 
358 
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:53,750 
No. Even if Mom and Dad tell you that most people are nice, 
 
359 
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,666 there are people out there who are anything but nice. 360 00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,000 
-Like your sister. 
-You idiot. 
 
361 
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,833 
My father said good and evil 
are a question of perspective. 
 
362 
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,375 Dead father, bad topic? 
 
                363 00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:10,291 
And if Erik is no longer alive? 
 
364 
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,791 
If he's lying dead somewhere and no one finds him? 
 
365 
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,041 That would be the worst. 
 
                366 00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,541 
Even if you're dead, you want to be found. 
 
367 
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:20,416 
          No one is dead, and no one won't be found, okay? 
 
                368 00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,541 
Can we please change the topic now? 
 
369 
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,875 
The most important thing is that we stick together. 
 
370 
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:28,541 That we pull together. 
 
371 
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:31,541 
        The most important thing is not to blow this out of proportion, 372 
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,958 or we'll have the press 
in town in a few days. 
 
373 
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:37,083 
We know that doesn't quite fit in with your plans, Regina. 
 
374 
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,583 
     If you mean my hotel, this isn't about that at all. 
 
                375 00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:42,666 
-No? What is it about then? 
-It's about our town. 
 
                376 00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,750 
Wrong. This is about a missing child. 
 
377 
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,916 
Who probably just ran away. 
You just heard it yourself. 
 
378 
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:52,791 
Maybe you should just worry about your own problems. 
 
                       379 00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:57,500 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 
380 
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,583 It's going to happen again. 
 
381 
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:09,958 Helge! 
 
                382 00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,708 
-What are you doing here? 
-Is it already too late? 
 
383 
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:14,916 
Helge. 
 
384 
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:16,750 It's me, Charlotte. 
 
385 
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,166 I'll take you back now, okay? 
 
386 
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,833 It's going to happen again! 
 
387 
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,250 I'm bored. 
 
388 
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:45,541 
-Can we please go home now? 
-Nonsense, we're nearly there. 
 
389 
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,166 Jonas! 
 
390 
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,125 Come on! 
 
391 
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000 ATTENTION! 
 
392 
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,791 Over there. 
 
393 
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,458 In the armchair. 
 
                394 00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,583 
-And? 
-Fuck, dude. 
 
                395 00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,791 
-It was here! 
-Looking for this? 
 
396 
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,791 
-What's she doing here? 
-That's mine. 
 
397 
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:58,750 
The definition of ownership says 
 
398 
        00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:02,208 that possession is nine-tenths of the law, so it's mine for now. 
 
399 
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,458 
But I'm selling. 
What'll you give me for it? 
 
400 
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,541 A kick in the ass. 
 
                401 00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500 
What's in here is easily worth 500. 
 
402 
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,625 
It's yours for 200. 
Daddy's got plenty of money. 
 
403 
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,500 Stop the bullshit. 
 
404 
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,000 Just give it to me. 
 
405 
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,458 Jackpot! 
 
406 
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,416 What's that? 
 
407 
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:32,458 Someone's there. 
 
408 
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,000 Oh, shit! 
 
409 
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,416 Holy shit! 
 
410 
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,625 Shit. 
 
                411 00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,958 
-Damn flashlight! 
-What is this? 
 
412 
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,250 What's that? 
 
                413 00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,625 
-Run! 
-Move! 
 
                414 00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,375 
-Run! -Go! 
 
415 
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,583 Come on. 
 
416 
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,416 Mikkel? 
 
417 
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,541 Mikkel! 
 
418 
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,416 Jonas. 
 
                419 00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,666 
What the fuck, man! What was that? 
 
420 
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,625 No idea. Shit! 
 
421 
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,916 
Man, what was that? 
 
422 
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:23,791 Where are Jonas and Mikkel? 
 
423 
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,208 Where is Mikkel? 
 
424 
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,458 Where is Mikkel? 
 
425 
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,791 Why isn't he with you? 
 
426 
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,416 He was with you! 
 
427 
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,750 Shit! Mikkel! 
 
428 
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,250 Mikkel! 
 
429 
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,541 Too late. 
 
430 
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,208 We're too late. 
 
431 
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,125 Mikkel! 
 
432 
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:39,500 Mikkel! 
 
433 
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,291 Mikkel! 
 
434 
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,291 Mikkel! 
435 
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,625 Mikkel! 
 
436 
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,041 Mikkel? 
 
437 
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:02,875 Mikkel! 
 
438 
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,833 Mikkel! 
 
439 
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,458 Do you have anything? 
 
440 
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:18,916 Okay. 
 
441 
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:23,708 Yes? 
 
                442 00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,291 
-Have you found him? -Nothing. 
 
443 
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,916 No trace of Mikkel. 
 
                444 00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,416 
-How's Franziska? -Sleeping. 
 
445 
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:38,041 Charlotte, I... 
 
446 
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,916 Can we... 
 
447 
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:45,125 
I have to tell you... 
448 
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:47,541 Charlotte? 
 
449 
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,833 I have to go. 
 
450 
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:50,458 Okay. 
 
451 
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,333 Okay. 
 
452 
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:04,166 
God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, 
 
453 
      00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,291 the courage to change the things I can, 
and the wisdom to know the difference. 
 
454 
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:12,000 
God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, 
 
455 
      00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:16,041 the courage to change the things I can, 
and the wisdom to know the difference. 
 
456 
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:33,291 
Calling all units. 
At the forest edge at Neuweiher, 
 
457 
  00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:37,375 elevation F026, two-mile marker, 
a child's body has been found. 
 
                458 00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:40,125 
I repeat, a child's body has been found. 
 
459 
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:21,041 I'm sorry. 
460 
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:27,166 That's not Mikkel. 
 
461 
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,500 That's not Mikkel. 
 
462 
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:47,958 
We fall through the time stream 
Then awaken from a dream 
 
463 
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:56,541 
But a brief blink of an eye 
And then returns the night 
 
464 
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:06,166 
Somehow the future starts somewhere 
Sometime 
 
465 
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,583 
I won't wait for long 
 
466 
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:14,208 
Love is created through bravery 
So don't think about it twice 
 
467 
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:18,916 
We ride on fiery wheels 
Towards the future through the night 
 
468 
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:09,541

TRUTHS 
 
6 
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,416 
Winden. Another missing person's case shocks the town. 
 
7 
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,208 
         A nine-year-old boy was reported missing this morning. 
 
8 
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,125 
MISSING 
 
9 
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,916 
  Police officials have yet to comment on the situation. 
 
10 
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,125 
But it can be assumed, that this case, too, 
 
11 
  00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,500 is connected to the disappearance 
of two other children in Winden. 
 
12 
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,625 
The last case of a missing child happened only three days ago. 
 
                13 00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,791 
You know what happened to Erik and Mikkel? 
 
14 
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,500 That they disappeared? 
 
                15 00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,375 
The same thing happened to Yasin. 
 
16 
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,875 My Yasin? 
 
17 
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,125 
Today he left home to go to school alone, and he disappeared on the way there. 
 
18 
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,458 
If you know anything at all, 
 
                19 00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,916 then you have to tell me now. 
 
20 
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,041 This Noah... 
 
21 
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,541 
What did he look like? 
Can you describe him? 
 
22 
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,541 Can you describe him? 
 
23 
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,000 He was tall. As tall as Dad. 
 
24 
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,625 He had a hat on. 
 
25 
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,583 And blue eyes. 
 
26 
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,500 Did Noah steal Yasin? 
 
27 
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,833 I don't know. 
 
28 
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,041 I'll send somebody by. 
 
29 
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:34,375 
     And you will explain to him exactly what this Noah looked like. 
 
30 
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,291 Okay? 
 
                31 00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,708 
Every little detail is important. 
 
32 
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,583 
       What was that? You don't talk to your eight-year-old daughter that way! 
 
                33 00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,416 
Where were you the night Mikkel vanished? 
 
34 
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,750 At the office. 
 
                35 00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,958 
-I told you that. 
-For how long? 
 
36 
 00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,458 Until you called me. 11:00 p.m. 
 
                37 00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,666 
I know you weren't in the office. 
 
38 
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,958 
If you have anything to do 
with Mikkel's disappearance, 
 
39 
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,250 or with Erik's or Yasin's, then tell me now. 
 
40 
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,833 
I don't even want to know where you were, 
 
41 
     00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,000 or what you were doing, or with whom. 
 
42 
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,958 
          But I want you to look into my eyes right now 
 
43 
       00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,708 and assure me that you have nothing to do with all of this. 
 
44 
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,500 You're nuts. 
 
45 
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,750 This is for you. 
 
                46 00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,416 
Don't you finally want to talk to me? 
 
47 
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,250 
Is there maybe someone I should tell that you're okay? 
 
48 
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,791 Your parents, they... 
 
49 
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,833 They must be worried. 
 
50 
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,583 
You don't have to say what happened to you if you don't want to, but... 
 
51 
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,375 
If you want, 
 
52 
     00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,791 no matter what it is, you can tell me. 
 
53 
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,833 It's safe with me. 
 
54 
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,750 I promise. 
 
55

                63 00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,250 
-Hello, Martha. 
-Hello. 
 
64 
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,375 I wanted Katharina to have... 
 
65 
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,541 Hannah. 
 
66 
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,500 
I... I figured you weren't in the mood to cook right now. 
 
67 
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,750 With all of this. 
 
68 
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,000 And... 
 
69 
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,333 I thought... 
 
70 
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,750 Thanks. 
 
71 
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,375 Do you want to come in? 
 
72 
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,500 How are Martha and Magnus? 
 
73 
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,875 And Ulrich? 
 
74 
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,416 I don't know. 
 
75 
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,375 Where is he? 
 
76 
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,000 In the shower. 
 
77 
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,791 Hannah. 
 
78 
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,708 What are you doing here? 
 
79 
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,625 I... 
 
80 
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,083 Hannah brought us some food. 
 
81 
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,291 I have to go to the station. 
 
82 
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,500 Could you give me a ride? 
 
83 
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,208 I came by bike. 
 
84 
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,666 It's raining so hard. 
 
                85 00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,125 
-Only if... 
-Of course Ulrich can give you a ride. 
 
86 
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,875 Shall we? 
 
87 
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,125 Hannah? 
 
88 
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,500 Thanks for the food. 
 
89 
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,666 Sure. 
 
90 
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,125 
           And, really, if you need anything, call me. 
 
91 
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,791 Yes. No, I understand that. 
 
92 
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,791 
 Still, on such short notice we have to charge the full cancellation fee. 
 
93 
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,750 Yes, well I'm sorry. Goodbye. 
 
                94 00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,458 
Could you deliver this for me? 
 
                95 00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,875 
-Here, locally. 
-Are you leaving us already? 
 
                96 00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,208 
I have to go away for a few days. 
 
                97 00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,083 
But I'd like to keep the room if I can. 
 
                98 00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,916 -Certainly, that's no problem. 
-It needs to be delivered by this evening. 
 
                99 00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,916 
-It's important. 
-Yes, of course. 
 
100 
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,500 
Where were you this morning? 
I tried to reach you all morning. 
 
101 
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,125 Therapy. 
 
102 
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,833 Have you heard from Martha? 
 
                103 00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,291 
She's not calling me back and... 
 
104 
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,666 
  I don't know what she needs, the whole thing is so fucked up. 
 
                105 00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,541 
She'll get in touch when she's ready. 
 
106 
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,500 
Yeah, you're probably right. 
Come on, let's play. 
 
                107 00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,583 
-I follow you? 
-Yeah, watch the corridors ahead. 
 
108 
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,125 Can I trust you? 
 
109 
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,958 If I tell you a secret. 
 
                110 00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,791 
Can I trust you not to tell anyone else? 
 
111 
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,583 Yeah, sure. 
 
                112 00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,375 
I'm in contact with Erik's dealer. 
 
113 
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,333 And I'm meeting him tonight. 
 
                114 00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:38,041 
-You're doing what? 
-Watch it! Shoot! Triangle! No! 
 
115 
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,041 No!  
                116 00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,541 
I'm going there tonight in any case. 
 
117 
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,583 And I want you to come along. 
 
118 
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,375 Can I count on you? 
 
119 
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,000 Yeah, sure. Always. 
 
120 
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,416 
FOR CHARLOTTE 
 
121 
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,833 I'm Noah. 
 
                122 00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,541 
I'm a priest at St. Christopher's Church. 
 
123 
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,500 Ines called me. 
 
124 
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:41,958 Do you believe in God? 
 
                125 00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,750 
How do you believe the world came to be? 
 
126 
     00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,833 Who created all the beautiful things? 
 
127 
        00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,416 The world came to be through the Big Bang. 
 
128 
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,041 
13.8 billion years ago. 
 
129 
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,458 
That's how space, time and matter came to be, 
 
130 
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,291 and Earth as well. 
 
131 
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,000 The rest is evolution. 
 
                   132 00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,291 And what was there before the Big Bang? 
 
                   133 00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,458 
Nothing can arise from nothing. 
 
134 
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:17,125 
Maybe the Big Bang is nothing more than God's act of creation. 
 
135 
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,791 
       My father says religion is the brainwashing of the masses. 
 
136 
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,625 
I'm sure your father knows a lot, 
 
137 
 00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,000 but he doesn't know everything. 
 
138 
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,833 
It's good that he raised you to question things. 
 
139 
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,958 
   But every now and then, it's good to question those who question things. 
 
140 
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,000 
God has a plan for every human being. 
 
141 
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,791 Including you. 
 
                142 00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,625 
I want you to stop calling me. 
 
143 
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,958 Okay? Just stop. 
 
                144 00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,125 
-I can't do this anymore. 
-Is that what I am to you? 
 
145 
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,833 Some damn affair? 
 
146 
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,666 
    It's not something you can just switch off. 
 
147 
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,208 I can't. 
 
148 
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,083 And neither can you. 
 
149 
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,541 Look at me. 
 
150 
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,625 Look at me! 
 
                151 00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,375 
And now tell me there's nothing there. 
 
152 
    00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,333 That this doesn't mean shit to you. 
 
153 
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,583 
No matter what you need, I'm here for you. 
 
154 
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,416 What I need? 
 
155 
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,541 Don't call me. Don't come by. 
Just leave us alone. 
 
156 
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,541 Okay? 
 
157 
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,541 Get lost! 
 
158 
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,208 
              Don't think that I'm just going to let you go. 
 
159 
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,041 
And then she says, 
"When you grow up your heart dies." 
 
160 
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:36,041 
That line hits you, bam! 
Right in your face, you know? 
 
161 
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,708 
           And in the end you think they've become friends 
 
162 
       00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,958 because that created a bond between them. 
 
163 
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,000 
But in the end, they're all stuck in their little pigeonholes. 
 
164 
      00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,458 Maybe you want to see it again with me? 
 
165 
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,208 Hey! 
 
166 
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,666 Are you even listening to me? 
 
167 
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,083 Yeah. 
 
168 
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,791 Let's talk later, okay? 
 
                169 00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,708 
Hey, girls, what are you up to? 
 
170 
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,125 
-Want to go out for a smoke? 
-Good idea. 
 
171 
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,250 Are you sure? 
 
                172 00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,375 
We don't have to if you don't want to. 
 
173 
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,875 
I'd rather do it with you than some other guy. 
 
174 
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,500 But you'll get condoms. 
 
                175 00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,791 
I don't want AIDS and I don't want kids. 
 
176 
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,041 No way, okay? 
 
                177 00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,541 
-Yeah. 
-I'm not joking. 
 
178 
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,583 No kids. 
 
179 
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,750 Never. 
 
180 
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,250 I promise. No kids. 
 
181 
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,000 
  Child Protective Services will assume custody for now. 
 
182 
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:33,000 
     So until we find his family and can assess the situation better, 
 
183 
   00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,750 he'll be put in a children's home. 
 
184 
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,541 A children's home? 
 
185 
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,333 
Can't he stay here in the hospital for a while? 
 
                     186 00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,750 No. Unfortunately that's not possible. 
 
187 
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,541 
     But I can assure you that the people in the children's home 
 
188 
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,375 will be able to attend 
very specifically to his needs. 
 
189 
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,958 It's best for him. 
 
190 
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,916 Do you have children? 
 
191 
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,708 No.  
192 
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,208 
             I had a son who died just after he was born. 
 
193 
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,291 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 
194 
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,125 
       I'm certain his family will be in touch sooner or later. 
 
195 
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,000 Or his school. 
 
                196 00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,000 
We'll find out where he belongs. 
 
197 
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,208 Well, then. 
 
198 
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,583 He's a peculiar boy. 
 
199 
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,041 Really very sensitive. 
 
200 
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,291 Don't worry. 
 
201 
 00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,500 I'll come get him on Wednesday. 
 
202 
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,250 
POLICE 
 
203 
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,625 
Do you know why I became a policeman? 
 
204 
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:55,500 
 When my brother vanished back then, they made every mistake in the book. 
 
205 
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,541 
The chief investigator was a drunken moron. 
 
206 
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,958 And I... 
 
                207 00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,291 
I swore I'd do everything differently. 
 
208 
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,583 That I'd do things right. 
 
209 
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,541 
        That I wouldn't become an incompetent asshole pig like him. 
 
210 
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,208 That was 33 years ago. 
 
211 
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,875 And now look at me. 
 
212 
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,000 I'm a joke. 
 
213 
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,458 I cheat on my wife. 
 
214 
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,125 
My son has vanished. 
I can't do anything. 
 
215 
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,166 Thirty-three years. 
 
216 
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,333 Everything is the same. 
 
                217 00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,250 
Just that now I'm the incompetent asshole. 
 
                218 00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,041 
Have you ever heard of the 33-year cycle? 
 
219 
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,208 
  Our calendars are wrong, a year isn't 365 days long. 
 
220 
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,708 
We're always a bit "out of sync," so to speak. 
 
221 
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,833 
        But every 33 years everything is just like it was. 
 
222 
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:06,125 
The stars, the planets, the whole universe returns to the exact same position. 
 
223 
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,416 The lunar-solar cycle. 
 
224 
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,583 
My grandpa was obsessed with such things, the Big Bang and the Big Crunch. 
 
                225 00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,750 
Nietzsche's eternal recurrence. 
 
226 
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:23,666 
    When I was little I always felt that something was wrong with Winden. 
 
227 
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,208 
I have that same feeling again. 
 
228 
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,583 That everything's repeating. 
 
                229 00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,583 
That this has all happened before. 
 
230 
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,916 Like a massive déjà vu. 
 
231 
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,916 
WINDEN BOY MISSING 
 
232 
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,833 You look like him. 
 
233 
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,250 Your father. 
 
234 
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,583 Do we know each other? 
 
235 
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:22,541 No.  
236 
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,250 But I knew your father. 
 
237 
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,958 It was a long time ago, but I remember him well. 
 
238 
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,416 He saved my life back then. 
 
                239 00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,000 
But I only understood that much later. 
 
240 
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,000 Life is a labyrinth. 
 
241 
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:44,000 
         Some people wander around their whole lives looking for a way out, 
 
242 
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,250 but there's only one path 
and it leads you ever deeper. 
 
243 
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:51,125 
     You don't understand it until you've reached the center. 
 
244 
00:23:56,583 --> 00:24:00,583 
   Death is incomprehensible, but you can make peace with it. 
 
245 
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,333 
Till then you should ask yourself each day if you've made the right decisions. 
 
246 
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,875 
DRY CLEANING 
 
247 
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,625 This will take a while. 
 
248 
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,625 Half an hour or so. 
 
249 
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,875 Hey? Everything okay? 
 
250 
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,458 Okay. 
 
251 
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:34,375 
I AM NOT AFRAID 
 
252 
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,000 Do you think I'm pretty? 
 
253 
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,041 Well, great. 
 
                254 00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,708 
Know what I sometimes imagine? 
 
255 
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,250 That I can do magic. 
 
                256 00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:10,958 
I imagine that I want something. 
Really badly. 
 
                       257 00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:14,000 And then it happens, because I imagine it. 
 
258 
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,416 Like moving that bottle cap. 
 
259 
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,083 Do you know Houdini? 
 
260 
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:23,541 Who? 
 
261 
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,583 
              Harry Houdini, one of the world's greatest magicians. 
 
262 
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,958 
There is no such thing as magic, just illusion. 
 
                263 00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:39,458 
Things only change when we change them. 
 
264 
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,958 
But you have to do it skillfully, 
 
265 
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,541 in secret. 
 
266 
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,208 Then it seems like magic. 
 
                267 00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,375 
-Where did you learn that? 
-I'm from the future. 
 
                268 00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,125 
-You're cool. 
-No, I'm Mikkel. 
 
                269 00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,958 
Hi, Mikkel, boy from the future. 
I'm Hannah. 
 
                270 00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:46,291 
My mother told me about the old world. 
 
271 
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,208 Before the flood. 
 
                272 00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:52,291 
She said it had been of a different kind. Foul. 
 
273 
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:56,041 
   She would braid my hair and recount harrowing tales, 
 
274 
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,875 of my father 
and of demons from the underworlds. 
 
275 
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,166 
She said all is forgiven but nothing forgotten. 
 
276 
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,333 
Then the darkness in her eyes was greater than usual. 
 
277 
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,666 
And her words flowed like waves. 
 
                278 00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,750 
She said all was well now the way it was. 
 
279 
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:13,708 
MISSING 
 
280 
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:17,583 
  That all occupied its own space, in the past as in the here and now. 
 
281 
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:21,833 
When she spoke in this manner, something would overcome her. 
 
282 
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,625 
She would pull my braids tightly 
 
283 
  00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:27,208 as if to punish me for something 
that dwelled in a place deep within her. 
 
284 
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,375 
Something that tugged at her from the center, 
 
285 
        00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,375 like a hunger that could not be satisfied. 
 
286 
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:36,666 
          She spoke of yesterday as though it were before her very eyes. 
 
287 
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,208 
As if today was but a veil 
 
288 
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,750 that shrouded in shadow 
all that was real to her. 
 
289 
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,583 
The old world came to haunt her like a ghost 
 
290 
    00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:52,625 that whispered to her in a dream how 
to erect the new world, stone by stone. 
 
291 
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,458 From then on, 
I knew that nothing changes. 
 
                292 00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:00,625 
That all things remain as before. 
 
293 
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,875 
The spinning wheel turns, 
 
294 
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,458 round and round in a circle. 
 
295 
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,375 One fate tied to the next. 
 
296 
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:14,375 
       A thread, red like blood, that cleaves together all our deeds. 
 
297 
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:17,333 One cannot unravel the knots. 
 
298 
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,708 But they can be severed. 
 
299 
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,500 
He severed ours, 
 
300 
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:23,875 with the sharpest blade. 
 
301 
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,125 
Yet something remains behind that cannot be severed. 
 
302 
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,250 An invisible bond. 
 
303 
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:48,500 
CALL ENDED 
 
304 
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,166 Fuck. 
 
                305 00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:01,416 
On many a night, he tugs at it. 
 
306 
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:05,458 
   And then I wake with a start, knowing that nothing ceases to be. 
 
307 
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,916 That all remains. 
 
308 
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:54,833 That was great. 
 
309 
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,208 You were great. 
 
                310 00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:01,750 
-What are you doing here? 
-I wanted to tell you something. 
 
311 
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,208 I wasn't in France. 
 
312 
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,166 I was in the nuthouse. 
 
                313 00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,708 
They call it post-traumatic stress. 
 
314 
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,750 -Why didn't you say anything? -I didn't want you to think I was a freak. 
 
315 
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:27,875 
What happened between us last summer, that wasn't just nothing, was it? 
 
                316 00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:32,833 
I mean, if my father hadn't... 
 
                 317 00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:38,250 -If this all hadn't happened... 
-It's okay. 
 
318 
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,875 
Why did you call me this morning and not Bartosz? 
 
319 
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,041 I'm Bartosz. 
 
320 
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,083 I know. 
 
321 
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,458 I'm Noah. 
 
322 
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,333 Don't you want to get in? 
 
323 
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,291 Are you cheating on me? 
 
324 
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,541 Where did you get that idea? 
 
325 
    00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,791 I'm only going to ask you this once. 
 
326 
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,375 Are you cheating on me? 
 
327 
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:36,166 I'd never do that. 
 
328 
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:53,708 Dad? 
 
329 
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:00,666 
If you've seen something you shouldn't have... 
 
330 
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,083 What do you mean? 
 
                  331 00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,291 Well, something that's not right. 
 
332 
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:10,750 Not right in what sense? 
 
333 
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,750 
Well, 
 
334 
     00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:18,000 if someone does something with someone and it's wrong. 
 
335 
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,458 What did you see? 
 
336 
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:29,041 
Ulrich touched her breasts and laid on top of her. 
 
337 
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,875 And she didn't want it. 
 
338 
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:39,083 
  You're going to tell me exactly what you saw, okay? 
 
339 
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,625 
And then he laid down on top of her 340 
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:50,583 and held her mouth shut. 
 
341 
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,333 Like this. 
 
342 
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,791 Did she resist? 
 
                343 00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:01,000 
She yelled "stop" and struggled. 
 
344 
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,458 But he was on top of her. 
 
345 
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,000 Did he see you? 
 
346 
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,083 What did he do then? 
 
                  347 00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:19,625 
-Did he...? 
-He choked her and she went all red. 
 
                  348 00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:27,208 -Then he pulled down his pants and... 
-You don't have to continue. 
 
349 
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,625 You did the right thing. 
 
350 
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,708 You were very brave. 
 
                351 00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:42,833 
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M. 
 
352 
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,125 
"Dear Jonas, 
 
353 
    00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,041 by the time you read this everything 
will have happened, irrevocably. 
 
354 
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,750 It can no longer be changed. 
 
355 
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,875 
        I would have liked to explain things to you sooner, 
 
356 
 00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:06,083 but I hope once you understand 
how everything is connected, 
 
357 
  00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,125 you will understand my decision. 
 
358 
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,875 
I AM NOT AFRAID 
 
359 
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,708 The truth is a strange thing. 
 
360 
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,041 
You can try to suppress it, 
 
361 
 00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,833 but it will always find its way back to the surface. 
 
362 
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:23,583 
We make a lie into our truth in order to survive. 
 
363 
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,750 We try to forget. 
 
364 
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,208 Until we can't anymore. 
 
365 
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:35,041 
                 We don't know even half of the mysteries of this world. 
 
                366 00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,666 
We are wanderers in the darkness. 
 
367 
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,500 This is my truth. 
 
368 
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:46,041 
On November 4, 2019 
 
                369 00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:50,625 
I traveled through time to the year 1986. 
 
370 
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,125 
The boy from the future stayed, 
 
371 
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,250 and in time he became a man. 
 
372 
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:59,208 
Mikkel became Michael, 
 
373 
  00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,333 who never knew where he belonged. 
 
374 
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:07,083 By the time you read this I'll already be gone. 
 
375 
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:09,750 Mikkel? 
 
376 
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:13,166 Both as a boy and as a man. 
 
377 
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,166 I hope you can forgive me. 378 
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,000 Everything is connected.

Michael." 
 
381 
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:41,541 
THIS BOOK BELONGS TO MIKKEL 
 
382 
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,458 Can I help you? 
 
                383 00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:16,500 
I'd like to talk to you about time.

1 
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:15,041 
THE DAY OF MIKKEL'S DISAPPEARANCE 
 
2 
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,666 
       God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, 
 
3 
      00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:58,791 the courage to change the things I can, 
and the wisdom to know the difference. 
 
4 
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,791 
       God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, 
 
5 
       00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,000 the courage to change the things I can... 
 
6 
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,041 
SCHOOL ID - MADS NIELSEN 
 
7 
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,000 Tronte! 
 
8 
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,833 I... 
 
9 
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,916 It's me, Peter. 
 
10 
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,666 I... 
 
11 
     00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,291 There's something here you should see. 
 
12 
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,916 It's to do with your son. 
 
13 
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,666 No, not Ulrich. 
 
14 
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,000 Mads. 
 
15 
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:42,916 How... 
 
16 
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,833 That's impossible. 
 
17 
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,250 That's impossible. 
 
                18 00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,000 
He was just there all of a sudden. 
 
19 
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,333 Mads. 
 
20 
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,666 Mads. 
 
21 
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,166 Someone's coming. 
 
22 
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,000 Tronte. 
 
23 
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,291 Claudia? 
 
24 
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,166 Peter. 
 
25 
  00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,833 There's a lot I have to explain. 
 
26 
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:15,500 
    But first we need to take Mads to the place where he is to be found. 27 
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,708 We don't have much time left. 
 
28 
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:55,541 
ALPHA AND OMEGA 
 
29 
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,208 I'm sorry. 
 
30 
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,708 I really fucked up. 
 
31 
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,708 Since Mikkel disappeared... 
 
                32 00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,166 
I don't recognize myself anymore. 
 
33 
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,500 It doesn't matter, okay? 
 
34 
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,083 Everything's okay. 
 
35 
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,375 Everything's okay. 
 
36 
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,166 You know how he is. 
 
                37 00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,250 
He usually comes back after a few hours. 
 
                38 00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,625 
He's never been gone this long. 
 
39 
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,583 
Was my colleague Ulrich Nielsen here again? 
 
40 
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,458 
No. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. 
 
41 
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,916 
          Only on Saturday, when he lashed out at Mr. Doppler. 
 
42 
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,583 
      As if your father-in-law had something to do with the case. 
 
43 
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,541 Did you know? 
 
44 
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,208 Did I know what? 
 
45 
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,166 The boy from the future. 
 
46 
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,875 You knew. 
 
47 
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,500 This is for you. 
 
                48 00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,500 
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M. 
 
                49 00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,208 
-That's impossible. -What? 
 
50 
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,416 I burned it. 
 
51 
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,000 How long have you known? 
 
52 
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,333 I've always known, really. 
 
53 
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,041 
When your father came to me, 
 
54 
 00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,750 he was a disturbed little boy. 
 
55 
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,083 
           I just thought he had an overactive imagination. 
 
56 
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:27,458 
That something bad must have happened to him, something he couldn't bear. 
 
57 
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,541 He told me... 
 
58 
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,291 he came from the future. 
 
59 
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,625 I didn't believe him. 
 
60 
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,458 If you knew... 
 
61 
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,208 why didn't you stop it? 
 
62 
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,166 
           I didn't know that he would take his own life. 
 
63 
  00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,916 But you could have saved Mikkel! 
 
64 
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,583 
       Now I have another grandma and she's the principal of my school! 
 
65 
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,541 
    Her husband, who's fucking my mom, is looking for his son, who's my father! 
 
                66 00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,875 
A few days ago I kissed my aunt. 
 
67 
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,333 And the crazy thing is... 
 
68 
      00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,375 there's nothing wrong with any of them. 
 
69 
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,166 They're okay. 
 
70 
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,875 I'm what's wrong. 
 
71 
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,291 I think things... 
 
72 
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,458 no matter how abnormal 
 
73 
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,750 or strange they seem to us, 
 
74 
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,458 happen for a reason. 
 
75 
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,250 Who are we to play God? 
 
76 
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,291 What's past is past. 
 
77 
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,208 But you... 
 
78 
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,916 live in the here and now. 
 
                79 00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,958 
Who knows what the future will bring. 
 
80 
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,708 I just want everything to go back to normal. 
 
81 
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,291 
As a kid, all that Houdini dreamed of was becoming a magician. 
 
82 
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,833 Do you have the same dream? 
 
83 
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,583 Yes. 
 
                84 00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,208 
But the magic I want to do is impossible. 
 
85 
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,250 Which is what? 
 
                86 00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,416 
I just want to finally wake up. 
 
                        87 00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,333 Have you heard of Master Zhuang's paradox? 
 
88 
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,166 I dreamt I was a butterfly. 
 
89 
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,666 
          Now I've woken up and no longer know if I'm a person 
 
                90 00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,541 who dreamed he's a butterfly, 
 
91 
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,958 
or if I'm a butterfly who's dreaming 
 
92 
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,958 it's a person. 
 
93 
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,666 What are you? 
 
94 
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,875 A person or a butterfly? 
 
95 
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,250 Maybe I'm both. 
 
96 
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,625 My name is Egon Tiedemann. 
 
97 
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,291 
    Maybe we can just start with you telling me your name. 
 
98 
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,416 Tiedemann? 
 
99 
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,000 Egon, yes... 
 
100 
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,125 Of course. 
 
                101 00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,750 
-Are you a Satanist? 
-A Satanist? 
 
102 
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,750 No, I'm a cop. 
 
103 
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,375 A cop? 
 
104 
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,583 
It's a song from the 80s. 
 
                105 00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,958 
I can tell you now, you won't like it. 
 
106 
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,208 Look into the camera. 
 
                107 00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,375 
Why did you kill the children? 
 
108 
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,458 
I didn't kill the children. 
I tried to save them. 
 
109 
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,958 What did you do to Helge? 
 
110 
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,250 He's still alive. 
 
111 
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,625 
He must be. 
Or the children wouldn't be dead. 
 
112 
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,208 Where is Helge now? 
 
                113 00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,541 
-Where is he? 
-I can change it all. 
 
114 
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,708 
 I can change everything that's going to happen, but you have to let me go. 
 
                115 00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,833 
-Look into the camera. -Please! 
 
116 
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,166 
Look into the camera! 
117 
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,833 
    You know what we do with child murderers here? 
 
118 
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,458 You stupid asshole. 
 
119 
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,083 
      You're just as small-minded as everyone else in this shitty town. 
 
120 
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,583 Let me go! 
 
121 
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,666 
Are you already drinking, or will you start after your wife leaves you, 
 
122 
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,041 and you realize 
how pathetic and pitiful you are? 
 
123 
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,250 Let me go! Let me go! 
 
124 
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,291 Leave me! Let me out! 
 
125 
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,000 
I need to get to my son. 
I have to find my son! 
 
126 
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,541 I waited for you. 
 
127 
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,708 On Thursday. 
 
                128 00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,416 
-Yes, fuck... 
-What do you mean "fuck"? 
129 
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,375 
   I didn't tell anyone you were in the nuthouse. 
 
130 
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,166 I lied for you. 
 
131 
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,875 France, baguettes... 
 
132 
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,958 Blah, blah, blah... 
 
                133 00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,166 
Turns out you lie pretty well yourself. 
 
134 
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,583 You don't even need me. 
 
135 
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,500 Martha told me everything. 
 
                    136 00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:52,083 -It just happened. I really didn't... 
-What didn't you want? 
 
137 
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,666 To blow me off? 
 
138 
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,041 To lie to me? 
 
139 
 00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,666 To make out with my girlfriend? 
 
140 
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,250 You're a sick piece of shit! 
 
141 
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,000 Just like your dad. 
142 
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,583 What are you doing? 
 
143 
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,833 Have you lost it? 
 
144 
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,333 Don't ever come back here! 
 
145 
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,583 Get the hell out of here! 
 
146 
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,833 You repaired it. 
 
147 
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,833 That one's yours. 
 
148 
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,083 And this one's mine. 
 
149 
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,958 I built it many years ago. 
 
150 
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,208 
It's the same device, 
 
                151 00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,416 but in a different condition. 
 
152 
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,000 You see. 
 
153 
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,708 
It's as if 
 
154 
      00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:19,916 one could look at the beginning and end of something at the same time. 
 
155 
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,666 Wait a moment. 
 
156 
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,333 
This thing here 
 
157 
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,708 it sends a kind of signal. 
 
158 
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,791 An electromagnetic impulse. 
 
159 
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,166 
      As if it were trying to communicate with something. 
 
160 
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,916 And look at this. 
 
161 
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,541 This part has never moved. 
 
162 
  00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,416 It was included in the blueprint, but I never knew what it was for. 
 
                163 00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,750 
This thing communicates with the device. 
 
164 
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,916 
   It's not just the past that influences the future. 
 
165 
    00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,625 The future also influences the past. 
 
166 
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,625 You see. 
 
167 
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,291 
If you hadn't shown me what the device looks like in the future, 
 
                168 00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,333 
I wouldn't have been able to build it. 
 
169 
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,666 A paradox. 
 
170 
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,375 
These openings 
 
171 
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,000 didn't exist either. 
 
                172 00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,916 
I have no idea what their purpose is. 
 
173 
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,625 What's that? 
 
174 
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,583 Cs-137. 
 
                175 00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,958 
A radioactive isotope of Cesium. 
 
                176 00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,416 
The device generates a Higgs field. 
 
177 
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,000 
It increases the mass of the Cesium, 
 
178 
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,416 
An electromagnetic impulse causes it 
 
                179 00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,500 to implode into a black hole. 
 
180 
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,041 
    The same thing must have happened during the nuclear power plant incident. 181 00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,666 
Why did you decide to help me after all? 
 
182 
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,375 Why? 
 
183 
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,208 That's a big word. 
 
184 
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,208 
Why do we decide for one thing and against another? 
 
185 
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,958 
          But does it matter whether the decision is based upon 
 
186 
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:35,208 the consequence 
of a series of causal links? 
 
187 
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:39,875 
    Or whether it stems from an undefined feeling inside me? 
 
188 
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:47,791 
That perhaps everything in my life boils down to this one moment. 
 
189 
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,750 That I'm part of a puzzle. 
 
190 
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,791 
One that I can neither understand 
 
191 
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,541 nor influence. 
 
192 
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,125 Will you tell me... 
 
193 
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,791 what the future's like? 
 
194 
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,791 
      I'm hoping that by tomorrow, it'll already be different from today. 
 
195 
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,375 Yes? 
 
                196 00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,000 
Your father was kidnapped as a kid, right? 
 
197 
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,458 Do you remember when exactly? 
 
198 
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:33,916 I... 
 
199 
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:35,958 Can we talk? I... 
 
                 200 00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,500 -I have to tell you something... 
-When exactly? '53? '54? 
 
201 
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,791 Fall of '53. 
 
                202 00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,000 '53. 
 
203 
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,041 Exactly 66 years ago. 
 
204 
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,833 Two times 33. 
 
                205 00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,041 
-It's all connected. 
-Listen, Charlotte, I... 
 
206 
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,041 I have to talk to you. 
 
207 
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,416 Later, okay? I've got to go. 
 
208 
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,458 Can I help you? 
 
209 
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,250 Were you looking for me? 
 
210 
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,625 You have to stop. 
 
211 
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,458 What do I have to stop? 
 
212 
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,500 He's using you. 
 
213 
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,708 All of his promises are lies. 
 
214 
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,958 
I think you're mistaking me for someone else. 
 
215 
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,666 
I think you're mistaking me for someone else. 
 
216 
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,041 I've said that before. 
 
217 
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,458 
Everything Noah says 
 
218 
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,750 is a lie. 
 
219 
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,875 He's not the chosen one. 
 
220 
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,458 You're not the chosen one. 
 
221 
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,291 
        He doesn't want to save the world from evil. 
 
222 
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,250 He is evil. 
 
223 
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,125 Today is the day. 
 
224 
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,625 The beginning and the end. 
 
                225 00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,041 
Don't make the same mistakes I made. 
 
                226 00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,750 
Don't make the same mistakes I made. 
 
227 
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,500 You have to stop. 
 
228 
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,500 You have to stop! 
 
229 
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,416 I have to stop. 
 
230 
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,875 What happened to you? 
 
231 
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,083 I got into a fight. 
 
232 
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:27,708 What? 
 
233 
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,541 With whom? 
 
234 
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,208 It doesn't matter. 
 
                235 00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,583 
What do you mean, it doesn't matter? 
 
236 
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:45,625 Everything will be fine. 
 
237 
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,541 I left something at school. 
 
                238 00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,541 
Don't worry. Everything will be fine, Mom. 
 
                239 00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,750 
Charlotte asked me about the cabin. 
 
240 
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,791 And Helge. 
 
241 
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,208 About what happened in '53. 
 
                242 00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,833 
A few more hours, and it'll be over. 
 
243 
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,625 Mads will live. 
 
244 
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:31,916 Do you believe her? 
 
245 
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:38,541 
  Everything she said would happen has happened in the last eight days. 
 
246 
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,166 Just as it's written here. 
 
247 
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,791 
Then why have half of the pages been torn out? 
 
248 
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,458 What happens after today? 
 
249 
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,583 After today... 
 
250 
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,416 everything will be new. 
 
251 
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,750 
But if there is no God, 
 
252 
  00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,125 then why do we believe in a lie? 
 
                253 00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:15,541 
Because we prefer any lie to the pain. 
 
254 
    00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:20,708 Years ago, I was still a little boy. 
 
255 
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,333 A stranger came to us. 
 
                256 00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,083 
He looked as if he'd been in the war. 
 
257 
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,541 Didn't talk much. 
 
258 
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,416 
There was this sadness in his eyes. 
 
259 
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,875 The kind you sometimes see in those who want to die, 
 
260 
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,083 but life won't let them. 
 
261 
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,916 He took a room in our house. 
 
                262 00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,333 
The bedroom right next to mine. 
 
263 
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:45,250 And... 
 
264 
       00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,500 sometimes I heard him talk in his sleep. 
 
265 
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,041 Confused words. 
 
                266 00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,125 
But one night, he was suddenly very clear. 
 
267 
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,416 
He stood in the hallway, 
 
268 
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,333 
his eyes wide open, and said... 
 
                269 00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,458 "Nothing is in vain. 
 
270 
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,166 Not a single breath. 
 
271 
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,333 
Not a single step, not a single word. 
 
272 
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,458 Not pain. 
 
273 
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:17,000 
An eternal miracle of the One." 
 
                274 00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,208 
I didn't understand any of his words. 
 
275 
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,291 
Only years later, when I felt the pain, 
 
276 
 00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,708 did I understand what he meant. 
 
277 
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:36,041 
 That none of the horrible things that befall us should be in vain. 
 
278 
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,458 That's my son! 
 
                279 00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:40,500 
That they make us what we are. 
 
                280 00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,541 
That they give us our strength. 
 
                281 00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:49,916 
Your pain made you who you are, Helge. 
 
                282 00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,666 
But it no longer has power over you. 
 
283 
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,833 Who is next? 
 
284 
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,208 Jonas Kahnwald. 
 
285 
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,458 He'll be fine. Don't worry. 
 
                286 00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,166 
You can always come and visit him. 
 
                287 00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,291 
I'm taking you to your new home. 
 
                288 00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,958 
There are lots of other children there. 
 
                289 00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,125 
-Can you hear me? -Come. 
 
290 
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:00,416 Come. 
 
                291 00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:12,333 
You know, I've made a decision. 
I want to adopt him. 
 
292 
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:16,000 
     And to take provisional custody of him during the adoption procedure... 
 
293 
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,375 I'm afraid it's not so easy. 
 
                294 00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,333 
I have references. I own a home. 
 
                295 00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,083 
-I... 
-It's a very complicated process. 
 
296 
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,166 I know. 
 
297 
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,000 
It may seem somewhat rash. 
 
298 
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,291 But it isn't. 
 
299 
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,333 
-I can't just decide here... 
-The boy likes me. 
 
300 
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,083 He trusts me. 
 
301 
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,750 
     I'm the only person he lets close to him, and... 
 
302 
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,125 And I... 
 
303 
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,458 I like him, too. 
 
304 
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,125 What day is it today? 
 
                305 00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,500 
-The 12th. 
-What year? 
 
                306 00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,416 '86. 
 
307 
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,000 Are you from here? 
 
308 
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,833 What are you doing here? 
 
309 
    00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,875 Bringing someone back from the dead. 
 
310 
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,250 How does that work? 
 
311 
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,375 It's very hard to explain. 
 
312 
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,125 Can you bring these back? 
 
313 
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,083 
No, you have to find them when they're younger. 
 
                314 00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:45,000 But then they're not dead yet. 
 
315 
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,541 
That doesn't change the fact that they will die. 
 
316 
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,000 You're crazy. 
 
317 
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:56,291 Maybe. 
 
                318 00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:11,708 
"Helge Doppler. Nine years old. 
 
                319 00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:14,000 
Went missing on November 10, 1953. 
 
320 
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:17,208 
The kidnapping is being linked to an unknown person." 
 
321 
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:20,750 Page five. 
 
322 
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,166 IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER? 323 
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,375 Let me go. Please! 
 
324 
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,000 Please, let me go. 
 
325 
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:07,333 Where is Helge? 
 
326 
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:16,791 You don't want to talk? 
 
327 
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,333 I'll teach you how to talk. 
 
328 
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,500 Who are you? 
 
                329 00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,958 -There's no need to be afraid. -Hey! 
 
                330 00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,750 
Hey! What's this supposed to be? 
What is this? 
 
331 
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,791 Why did you lock me in here? 
 
332 
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:04,833 It wasn't me. 
 
333 
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,250 It was Noah. 
 
334 
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,625 Who's Noah? 
 
335 
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,250 
Where am I? What is this? 
336 
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,625 
This is a kind of prototype of a time machine. 
 
337 
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:15,166 You're the guinea pig. 
 
338 
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:18,583 
     The passage in the cave lies directly under this bunker. 
 
339 
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:21,041 
               If opened, the energy flows through this room. 
 
340 
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,833 But it needs to be increased. 
 
341 
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,833 No DeLorean. 
 
342 
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,416 No hissing or steam. 
 
343 
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,250 
    The first time machine is a bunker with four walls. 
 
344 
  00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,125 But it still doesn't quite work. 
 
                345 00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,208 
-Let me out of here. -I can't. 
 
346 
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,375 
It's the only way for things to be normal again. 
 
347 
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,791 Who are you? 
348 
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,791 You don't know? 
 
349 
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,541 The letter. 
 
350 
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,583 You burned it. 
 
351 
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:53,041 And yet it still exists. 
 
352 
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:59,125 
You'll carry that letter for almost 33 years before you pass it on. 
 
353 
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:01,958 To yourself. 
 
354 
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,833 I am you. 
 
355 
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:13,333 My name is Jonas Kahnwald. 
 
356 
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,333 I sent the letter to you. 
 
357 
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,750 Or should I say, to me. 
 
358 
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:21,416 
Everything you're experiencing, I've already experienced. 
 
                359 00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:28,916 
I burned the letter, just like you. 
I got it back from our grandmother. 
 
360 
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,958 
I've already had this conversation. 
 
                361 00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:32,875 
But I was on the other side then. 
 
                362 00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,458 
We think we're free, but we're not. 
 
363 
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,458 We follow the same old path. 
 
364 
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,333 Again and again. 
 
365 
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:41,791 That's crazy! 
 
366 
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,708 It doesn't make any sense! 
 
                367 00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,250 
You can decide to let me go now. 
 
368 
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,166 Come on, let me out! 
 
                369 00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,958 
I thought it was crazy for a long time. 
That I'm crazy. 
 
370 
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:00,625 
But I can't let you out because then you won't become what I am today. 
 
371 
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:03,958 If I now change my past, 
I will change who I am right now. 
 
372 
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:07,250 
        And then I won't be able to destroy the hole once and for all. 
 
373 
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,833 Why did you kiss Martha? 
 
374 
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:17,583 
      We're not free in what we do, because we're not free in what we want. 
 
                       375 00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,750 -We can't overcome what's deep within us. 
-Stop it. 
 
376 
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:21,666 Stop. 
 
377 
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:26,583 Please stop. 
 
378 
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,833 I have to bring Mikkel back. 
 
                379 00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:32,000 
I want everything to go back to normal. 
 
                380 00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:38,083 
I want all this sick shit to stop! 
 
381 
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,541 You still do. 
 
382 
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,208 
Thirty-three years later. 
I still want that. 
 
383 
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:45,083 But Mikkel... 
 
384 
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:48,750 
Our father is just a small part of a sprawling sickness. 
 
385 
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,375 
I've seen things 
that no one should ever see. 
 
386 
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:56,958 I'm sorry. 
 
387 
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:02,875 Wait. 
 
388 
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,500 Hey! Hey! 
 
389 
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,625 Stop! 
 
390 
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:09,916 Hey! 
 
391 
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:44,041 
But a brief blink of an eye 
And then returns the night 
 
392 
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:53,666 
Somehow the future starts somewhere 
Sometime 
 
393 
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,083 
I won't wait for long 
 
394 
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:02,291 
Love is created through bravery 
So don't think about it twice 
 
395 
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:06,750 
We ride on fiery wheels 
Towards the future through the night 
 
396 
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:37,125 
THURSDAY, NOV 13, 1986: 
SEVERE ACCIDENT AT INTERSECTION 
 
397 
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:47,000 COME TO THE CABIN. 
WE NEED TO TALK. PETER. 
 
398 
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,500 WHAT DOES NOAH WANT? 
 
399 
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:07,458 Everything is about to begin. 
 
400 
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,125 
        The older Jonas will destroy the hole, but... 
 
401 
        00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,250 he doesn't realize that he will be the one 
 
402 
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:22,250 to trigger its existence. 
 
403 
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,083 A paradox. 
 
404 
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,916 
The cesium in his useless machine 
 
405 
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,541 
won't destroy the hole forever. 
 
                      406 00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:34,333 It's what creates it in the first place. 
 
407 
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:37,416 He thinks he's the savior. 
 
408 
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,791 But Claudia lied to him. 
 
409 
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,583 
  Most people are nothing but pawns on a chessboard. 
 
410 
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,333 
Led by an unknown hand. 
 
411 
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:54,166 
              Their lives exist only to be sacrificed for a higher goal. 
 
412 
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,208 
Jonas, Mikkel, the children, 
 
413 
  00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:01,416 they're nothing but unfortunate, 
yet necessary chess moves 
 
414 
       00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:05,583 in an eternal war between good and evil. 
 
415 
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:12,541 
 There are two groups out there fighting to control time travel. 
 
416 
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:14,000 Light and shadow. 
 
417 
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,291 We belong to the light. 
 
418 
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:18,500 Don't forget that. 
 
419 
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:23,333 
Even though some of what we do is of a dark nature. 
 
420 
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,083 
But no victory is ever won without sacrifice. 
 
421 
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,916 
As long as we're in this time loop 
 
                422 00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,541 we who know have to make sure that every step will be repeated 
 
423 
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,625 exactly as it was before. 
 
                424 00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:38,125 
No matter how inhumane it seems to us. 
 
425 
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:41,250 
No matter what sacrifices it demands of us. 
 
426 
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,916 
But believe me, 
 
427 
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:47,083 the others are the ones who are truly inhumane. 
 
428 
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:51,708 
They have lost all humanity. 
They belong to the shadow. 
 
429 
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:55,916 
Your grandmother, Claudia, belongs to the shadow. 
 
430 
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:58,291 Never trust her. 
 
431 
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:00,291 No matter what she says. 
 
432 
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,375 
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME 
 
433 
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:05,375 
  Jonas trusted her before and he will trust her again. 
 
434 
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,708 
Jonas thinks he will change everything... 435 
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:11,083 but he's just her puppet. 
 
                436 00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:13,833 
He doesn't deserve any better. 
 
437 
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,541 Time is an infinite field. 
 
438 
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:31,458 
Millions and millions 
of interlocking wheels. 
 
                439 00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:36,416 
We have to be patient to be victorious. 
 
440 
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,625 But our time will come. 
 
                441 00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:47,666 
We will free humanity from its immaturity. 
 
442 
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,250 From its pain. 
 
443 
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:54,041 But you must be strong. 
 
444 
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:56,333 Can you do that? 
 
445 
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:02,291 Yes. 
 
446 
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,458 It's time. 
 
447 
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,666 
FOR MOTHER'S DAY 1986  448 
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,333 One, two... 
 
449 
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,791 One, two, three. 
 
450 
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:53,541 Hey, you. Hands up! 
 
451 
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,083 On the ground! 
 
452 
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:00,041 Who are you? 
 
453 
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,000 Where am I? 
 
454 
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:16,416 What year is this? 
 
455 
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,916 
Welcome to the future.
