Yeah, that is some detail.
That is some Western detail right there.

Western detail. Attention to detail.

He's even got spurs on the back
of his boots and they're sharp.

- Love it.
- They are.

The clock is gone on this piece,
Christine, so...

- Oh, my goodness
- Well, let's just move on.

Well, from time to time,
people make mistakes, that's okay.

This is our first Renoir of the evening.

This is a heliogravure,
which is an etching...

...it was hand pulled from a copperplate
in Paris in 1919.

We know this because
that's what it says on the back...

...where the certificate of authenticity
is located. Just as lovely as can be.

Look at the soft, delicate shading,
very feminine.

This is a limited edition.

This is what you're looking for
if you are a Renoir fan.

One hundred, oh, my goodness.
Right at the buzzer.

Good.

The few exceptions
is the African pancake tortoise...

...which has a flat, flexible shell
that allows it to hide in rock crevasses...

Big swath of light to moderate snow
from the Broken Bow area...

...down toward Kearney, Hastings,
Grand Island.

That is all moving in our direction,
so I do think around 7 to 8:00...

...the snow will become pretty steady
here across the region...

...with all this moving on top of us...

...and that's really gonna
knock down visibility.




And again, snow-covered roads are
gonna be definitely likely this evening...

...making it even slippier...
More slippery.

Than it is out there at this time.

There's that winter weather advisory
in effect...

...till very early tomorrow morning.

The bitter cold weather
helped break up the compactions...

...we created this fall in our fields.

Don't let false allegations bully you
into an unfair fight.

Hi, I'm Saul Goodman,
and I will do the fighting for you.

No charge is too big for me.

When legal forces have you cornered,
better call Saul.

I'll get your case dismissed.
I'll give you the defence you deserve.

Why? Because I'm Saul Goodman,
attorney at law.

I investigate, advocate, persuade,
and most importantly, win.

Better call Saul.

Do you feel doomed?

Have opponents of freedom
wrongly intimidated you?

Maybe they told you you're in serious
trouble and there's nothing you can do.

I'm Saul Goodman, and I'm here
to tell you that they're wrong.

It's never too late for justice.
Better call...

I think...

...your brain is just not all there yet.

If we were all held responsible
for what we did when we were 19...

I remember what it was like to be a kid.
Think back.

It's all... Judge, what would you say?

These boys, 19, I can't... I don't...

These three young men, just like you.

Just like...

Oh, to be 19 again.
You with me, ladies and gentlemen?

Do you remember 19?

Let me tell you, the juices are flowing,
the red corpuscles are corpuscling...

...the grass is green and it's soft,
and summer's gonna last forever.

Now do you remember? Yeah, you do.

But if you're being honest,
I mean, really honest...

...you'll recall that you also had
an underdeveloped 19-year-old brain.

Me, personally...

...if I were held accountable...

...for some of the stupid decisions
I made when I was 19, oh, boy, wow.

And I bet if we were in church right now,
I'd get a big "amen."

Which brings us to these three.

Now, these three knuckleheads...

And I'm sorry, boys,
but that's what you are.

They did a dumb thing.
We're not denying that.

However, I would like you to remember
two salient facts.

Fact one, nobody got hurt. Not a soul.
Very important to keep that in mind.

Fact two...

Now, the prosecution keeps
bandying this term "criminal trespass."

Mr. Spinauzo, the property owner,
admitted to us...

...that he keeps most portions
of his business...

...open to the public
both day and night.

So trespassing?

It's a bit of a reach, don't you think,
Dave?

Here's what I know.

These three young men,
near honour students all...

...were feeling their oats
one Saturday night and they just...

...went a little bananas.

I don't know. Call me crazy,
but I don't think they deserve...

...to have their bright futures ruined
by a momentary, minute...

...never-to-be-repeated
lapse of judgment.

Ladies and gentlemen...

...you're bigger than that.

- Kenny, are you rolling?
- Yeah, wait a minute.

- Yeah, baby. Yeah.
- Tone it down. Chill out, would you?

Hey, Miss Watson's fourth period
biology class, this one's for you.

- Watch and learn, losers.
- Oh, yeah.

- Oh, God.
- Dude, where'd all the blood go?

He's dead.
They suck it all out, dumb-ass.

- Awesome.
- Where do they put it?

All right, I'm through
the neck bone now, dude.

- Kenny, get over here.
- I'm getting it.

- Get a shot of this.
- Fine, fine.

- Let me do it.
- I got it.

All right.

- All right.
- Oh, my God.

You're sawing like a pussy. Let me do it.

Would you get off? Chill out.

- All right.
- Wait, wait. Okay. Wait for it. Wait.

Yeah.

- Come on. Yeah, baby. Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

I dare you to stick your wang
in the throat hole.

I will if you will, loser.

All right, all right.

- What the hell kind of math is that?
- Seven hundred per defence.

No, no, no. "Defendant." "Dant."

Three defendants, 2100.

Which, by the way, bargain.
What I did for them...

They going to jail, ain't they?

So since when does that matter?
They had sex with a head.

Look, didn't nobody tell you
to try all three of them together.

- One trial, $700.
- You're gonna miss me.

You are gonna miss me
because it'll be a cold day in hell...

...before I do any more PD work
for this shitty court. Sayonara, baby.

You have yourself a nice day.

Law offices of James McGill,
how may I direct your call?

Yes, Mrs. Kettleman,
so good of you to return.

Actually, I don't have Mr. McGill
at the moment, but I know he...

Oh, splendid.

Unfortunately,
our offices are being painted...

...and the fumes are quite horrid.

Could he meet you and your husband
at, say, Loyola's Café on Central?

Four o'clock it shall be. Cheers.

Three dollars.

I'm validated. See the stickers?

Well, I see five stickers. You're one shy.
That's $3.

They gave me... Look,
I'm validated for the entire day, okay?

Five stickers, six stickers,
I don't know from stickers because...

...I was in that court back there
saving people's lives, so...

Gee, that's swell.

And thank you for restoring my faith
in the judicial system.

Now, you either pay the $3...

...or you go back inside
and you get an additional sticker.

Son of a bitch.

Fine. You win. Hooray for you.

Backing up. I have to back up.
I need more stickers.

Don't have enough stickers.

Thank you. Thank you. Very nice.

Employee of the month over here.

Yeah. Hooray. Give him a medal.

Don't do anything, guys.
Just relax, all right?

Well, I'm just fuzzy as to why
you think he needs a lawyer.

I mean, Craig...

...the way you run your office
is beyond reproach.

- Beyond reproach.
- Yeah.

- I'm a stickler, you know...
- He is. He's a stickler with the money.

- He's definitely a stickler.
- Yeah. Yeah.

- He's certainly not guilty of some...
- Certainly not.

He's innocent of any wrongdoing,
that's abundantly clear to me.

And frankly, I don't go looking
for guilty people to represent.

I mean, who needs that aggravation,
right?

Right.

Look, all I know is
what I read in the paper.

And typically when money goes missing
from the county treasury...

- And the number here is 1.6 million?
- Well, that's an accounting discrepancy.

It's a discrepancy, absolutely.
But typically when that happens...

...the police look at the treasurer.

And since that person is...

I just think a little proactivity
may be in order.

I just think I'd look guilty
if I hired a lawyer.

Yeah.

Actually, it's getting arrested
that makes people look guilty...

...even the innocent ones.

And innocent people
get arrested every day.

And they find themselves
in a little room...

...with a detective who acts
like he's their best friend.

"Talk to me," he says.
"Help me clear this thing up."

"You don't need a lawyer,
only guilty people need lawyers."

And, boom,
hey, that's when it all goes south.

That's when you want
someone in your corner.

Someone who will fight tooth and nail.

Lawyers, we're like health insurance.

You hope you never need it,
but, man, oh, man, not having it? No.

How would we proceed
if we decided to...?

Well, this is a letter of engagement.

It's very simple, straightforward.
Please, read it closely.

But if you sign it...

...I can get started
on that defence strategy of ours...

...this very afternoon.

Craig...

...I think maybe we should sleep on it.

Sure.

- Don't you think, Mr. McGill?
- We should sleep on it.

Oh, please, call me Jimmy.

Absolutely. I mean, there's no rush.

Oh, and you know, Craig,
we gotta pick up the kids.

- At the...
- Right.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Well, we will be in touch.

Thank you for the coffee,
and for the advice.

You're very, very welcome.

Here. Take this.
It's got my phone number on it.

- Yeah. Okay.
- Got it.

The number is 9456, 0054...

...4896, 0643,
and the expiration is 11, '04.

Okay, and the key word here
is "classy," all right? Super classy.

Use only flowers that look expensive,
but, you know, aren't.

And the note should say:

"Dear Betsy and Craig.

Best wishes from your stickler
for justice, James McGill."

Okay? And McGill is spelled M-C...

Well, run it again.

Well, no, no, no. It's paid up.
Run it again...

Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

Oh, my God, Cal. Cal. Look at me.

Buddy, look at me. Are you okay?
Say something.

What did you do?
What did you do to my brother?

- Why don't you look where you're going?
- He came out of nowhere.

You freaking hit him, man.
You ran him over.

You ran over my brother.

- I got the whole thing on video.
- It was an accident.

It was an accident. He didn't...
He didn't mean to. Look, let me just...

- It's broke. Is it broke?
- It's my leg.

- You broke his leg.
- It's my leg.

Why you driving around
and not looking?

Driving around breaking people's legs.

- Okay.
- Somebody call the cops.

- Don't call... Don't call the police.
- Police.

Don't call the police.
Don't call the police.

Call them myself.

- Don't call the police.
- Don't call the cops?

- No.
- How you gonna fix this?

What are you gonna do
to make things right?

I don't know, fellas.

What can I do to make it right?

I don't know.

Five hundred dollars.

Five hundred bucks? Yeah?

Yeah.

- What the hell, man?
- Listen, Starlight Express.

I'm gonna give you a 9.6 for technique,
0.0 for choice of victim.

I'm a lawyer.

Furthermore,
does this steaming pile of crap...

...scream "payday" to you, huh?

The only way that entire car
is worth 500 bucks...

...is if there's a $300 hooker sitting in it.

Now, let's talk about
what you owe me for the windshield.

I'll take a cheque.

Chào cô, ladies.

Chào cô, Mrs. Nguyen.
My, don't you look...?

My mail?

You work for people
who have sex with chopped-off head?

- Was it in the paper?
- I heard it from my cousin.

Why? Why you work for these people?

Just lucky, I guess.

Cucumber water for customer only.

You have zero messages.

Brenda, looking good.

Nice 'do. Where's Lord Vader?

- He's not quite ready for you yet.
- South conference room.

- How about you wait out here?
- How about I don't?

Oh, Sir Francis.

- James.
- Well groomed, as always.

- Okay.
- All right.

Keith, Karen. Yes.

You have meddled with
the primal forces of nature, Mr. Hamlin...

...and I won't have it.

- Do you want me to call security?
- It's okay, Brenda. We got it.

- Hey, Jack. Hey, Nate. Hey, Aaron.
- What can we do for you, Jimmy?

I'm sorry, it's this table.

Something just comes over me.

You can tell me what this
26,000 is supposed to be for.

That's money for Chuck.
Isn't that what you wanted?

A measly 26 grand? Jesus,
you're like Peter Minuit with the Indians.

Throw in some beads and shells
while you're at it.

It's just a start, there'll be more.

Unless you're gonna
just tear them all up.

And why was it made out to me?
Why not Chuck?

Can he make his way to the bank?

I just assumed it was best
to have the money go through you.

We can do it any way you want.

This isn't going away, Howard.

What Chuck did for this firm,
and damn near single-handedly...

...one-third of this place belongs to him.
Yeah.

What have you got, 12 chairs here?
Four of these chairs are Chuck's.

You got five of these
light thingamajigs...

...one and two-thirds are Chuck's.
Yeah.

How many Danishes? Six Danishes?

- You can have all the Danish you want.
- No, no. They're Chuck's Danishes.

And Chuck isn't greedy,
so he'll just take two...

...plus $17 million. In that ballpark.

I mean, we'll know once we get
the accountants poking around here.

Until then, no more penny ante cheques
designed to make it look...

...like Chuck still works here.
He doesn't. He never will again.

It's time to do right by him,
and cash him out.

So these are Chuck's own wishes
that you're conveying?

This is what's best for him.

So he personally told you that
it's his wish to withdraw from the firm?

See, that would surprise me.

It's been nearly a year
since he set foot in here.

I'm just doing...

- ...what's in his best interests.
- So am I.

And I, for one, believe
he's gonna lick this thing.

Until then, his office is just as he left it.
His secretary is still on payroll.

If Chuck can call this an extended
sabbatical, then so can we.

He's that important to us.

You know what?
Let's let a jury figure it out.

Yeah. They're gonna love you, Howard.

You're so down to earth and relatable.

And you will atone.

It's Ned Beatty from Network.

For chrissakes, guys.

Jimmy.

I almost forgot. This month's filings.

You can save me the postage.

Weren't you listening in there?
Chuck doesn't work here anymore.

Think I'm gonna help you
establish a paper trail?

- Jimmy...
- Stop trying to pawn that shit off on him.

Jimmy.

You know, Jimmy,
sometimes in our line of work...

...you can get so caught up
in the idea of winning...

...that you forget to listen to your heart.

Give Chuck my love, would you?

Oh, there you are. Betsy, Craig.

Hi.
Oh, Craig, you need your own purse.

- Did it work out?
- Yeah.

It was very nice.

- You look lovely today.
- Oh, thank you so much.

- Couldn't you just...?
- You know I can't.

Son of a bitch.

- You ground yourself?
- Yes, I grounded myself.

You gotta stop
putting bacon on the list.

That cooler's looking like
a trichinosis stew.

Perfect timing.

Professor Brans Vogelson?

University of Helsinki?

Yeah, you're gonna
have to get that translated.

- Into Swedish?
- Finnish.

Finish translating into...?

I'm sure there's someone at UNM
who can do that.

You do know I'm trying
to start a legal practice?

Vogelson's been working
on the effects...

...of electromagnetic fields
on zebrafish and...

Financial Times.

Yeah, I knew you missed it,
so I figured, what the heck?

Thank you. I know it's expensive here.

- That's not...
- I don't expect you to go out-of-pocket.

Go ahead, reimburse yourself.

Thanks.

Hey, Chuck,
can you not read that for a second?

Can we talk?

Are you all right? You look peaked.

I'm fine. Please, just sit.

You're not in trouble?

You gotta cash out.

- You gotta.
- Again? Really?

There's no other way.

I know that you don't wanna hear it,
but you've got to.

You know I'm going to beat this.

You know I'm going to get better.

Yeah, sure.

Well, then there's nothing more
to talk about.

I will beat this.
Ergo, a falsis principiis proficisci.

- Meaning...
- That's not...

- Meaning...
- That's the one about false principles...

You proceed from false principles.

Your argument is built on quicksand,
therefore it collapses.

Yeah, you're not listening.

Fine. Let's take this
to its logical conclusion.

In order to pay out my share...

...suppose my partners are forced
to liquidate the firm.

- Then what?
- That's their problem.

My clients are out in the cold.

My cases are scattered to the winds,
126 people lose their jobs.

What happens to your cronies
in the mailroom?

The assistants, paralegals,
the janitorial staff...

...all of them out on the street.

Your friend Kim, a promising career,
over and done with.

Hamlin owes you everything.
You built that place singlehandedly...

...while he was at Four Hills
working on his bunker shot.

- Let's not exaggerate. I helped.
- You helped.

All the more reason not to tear it down
just for a little bit of cash.

Chuck, I'm going under. Okay?

For the third time,
with these bull-crap contract counsel...

- Bull crap?
- Bull crap, pissant, PD cases...

...at 700 bucks a shot.

Public defender work is some
of the best experience there is.

I just had a case, Chuck,
with three clients.

Arraignment, voir dire, jury trial,
the whole nine yards.

You know what I took home?
Seven hundred bucks.

I might as well head down to skid row
and sell plasma.

You're representing people
who have nowhere else to turn.

Money is beside the point.

Money is not beside the point.
Money is the point.

I keep telling you, have patience.
There are no shortcuts.

- Do good work and the clients...
- The clients will come. Yeah, I know.

Okay.

Hand to God, I wasn't gonna say this,
but you are broke.

I can't carry both of us.
I've been trying like hell, but I can't.

You're saying, what,
you think you have to provide for me?

- I never asked you that.
- You didn't have to ask, okay?

I've been doing my damnedest,
but the day of reckoning is here.

Soon, Chuck,
you're gonna be out on the street...

...with all the electromagnetism
in the world raining down on you.

Now, please, please, picture that...

...then tell me
that money is beside the point.

- This is what has you all worked up?
- Yeah.

Jimmy, there's nothing to worry about.

- Here.
- What is this?

A stipend.
There's gonna be one every week.

Eight hundred and fifty seven dollars
from Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

I'm gonna pay him back. Every penny.

I didn't wanna take anything,
but Howard was very insistent.

And I'm gonna pay you back too.

- Hamlin was here?
- It's not like I'm a recluse.

- He put his cell phone in the mailbox?
- He understands the situation.

- He grounded himself?
- Of course.

And the two of you agreed that since,
as everybody knows...

...you're going back to work
any day now...

...the firm should help you
make ends meet?

That's correct, minus the sarcasm.

Hamlin's making you a chump.

I'm going to get better.

I'm gonna go back to work,
and I'm picking up where I left off.

Sorry.

Sorry, Chuck.

I understand that
you're trying to look out for me...

...but you're missing the bigger picture.

I got it.

Speaking of which...

Howard brought this.

- He's concerned.
- What?

You have to admit,
it could be confusing.

Hamlin Hamlin McGill. James M. McGill.

- That's my name, I was born with it. I...
- Still.

How about "Vanguard Law"?

Or "Gibraltar." Ple...

Wait, so I'm not supposed
to use my name on Hamlin's say-so?

What's he gonna do, sue me?

Nobody wants to create
an adversarial situation.

I'm sure Howard would gladly pay
the cost of new matchbooks and so on.

It's simply a matter
of professional courtesy.

Chuck, whose side are you on?

There are no sides.

But, Jimmy...

Wouldn't you rather
build your own identity?

Why ride on someone else's coattails?

You wanna dance, Howard?

Let's dance.

Yeah, backside on it.

Go.

You can get closer than that,
you bitch. Come on.

All right, here it comes.

There you go. Better.

- How was that?
- It's all right. Here, take a look.

- So tighter. Everything...
- Tighter? What...? Tighter what?

I don't know, just stand tighter.
You know what I mean?

I don't know what you mean.

That's a... We can call that
a stylistic choice, I guess.

Hey, fellas. We got business.

How did you find us?

I know. Eerie, right?

Whoa, come on. Give me 30 seconds.

Could be the most profitable
30 seconds of your lives.

Let me tell you about a young guy.

Actually, he's about your age.

He lived a long way from here...

...in a town called Cicero, Illinois.

And in Cicero, he was the man.

I mean,
when he strolled down the street...

...all the corner boys
would give him the high five.

All the finest babes
would smile at him...

...and hope that he would smile back.

They called him Slippin' Jimmy...

...and everybody wanted
to be his friend.

Slippin' Jimmy.

What the hell kind of name is that?

Well, I'll tell you now.
Winters in Cicero are murder.

You guys, growing up out here
in the Golden West, you don't know.

Okay? I'm talking cold that'll freeze
the snot right in your nose.

I'm talking wind
that'll cut through your jacket...

...and carve you up like a Ginsu knife.

In fact, most folks in Cicero
were scared of winter.

But not Jimmy.

Jimmy would wait around all summer...

...and when September
finally rolled around...

...and he'd feel that first cold wind
come sweeping off Lake Michigan...

...he knew it was coming.

Was it Christmas? Was it Kwanzaa?

Better. It was slip-and-fall season.

As soon as it was cold enough,
he'd find a nice, smooth patch of ice.

State Street was good,
Michigan Avenue was better.

He'd pick his spot,
wait for it to get busy...

...then he'd walk out on the ice
and boom.

He would biff it so hard...

...people would come running
from five blocks away.

Yeah, but did he collect?

"Did he collect?"
Slippin' Jimmy had it dialled in.

One good fall, he'd clear 6, 8 grand.

That'd keep him in Old Milwaukee
and Maui Waui right through Labor Day.

- Eight grand?
- Eight grand.

Now, see, I look at you guys,
I see potential.

The skateboard's a nice wrinkle,
that makes it a year-round gig.

Clearly, you know how
to take a header. Right?

But I gotta ask you...

...your best day ever,
how much did you clear?

- Six hundred and thirty.
- Six hundred and thirty.

Six hundred and thirty bucks?
Was that for one fall?

- Two.
- Two falls in one day?

- Even at your age, that's gotta hurt.
- True that.

All right. Well, I got a job for you.

How's 2 grand sound?

Two grand for one hit?

One hit.

Plus you get to learn from the best.

- Nice boat.
- Yeah.

Discreet,
like a stripper pole in a mosque.

Forget the boat. Look at the car.
You know what that is?

- I don't know, a station wagon?
- It's a Mercury.

A 1988 Mercury Sable wagon.

Remember it. Burn it into your brains,
you got it?

It's a Mercury Sable wagon, sure.

Close your eyes. What colour is it?

- Brown.
- Brown.

No, it's medium sandalwood.

Keep your eyes closed.
How does the license plate start?

- Four.
- Give those gentlemen a gold star.

Betsy Kettleman's her name.

Every weekday between 2:25 and 2:50
she comes through here...

...on her way to pick up her kids
at Kit Carson Elementary.

You need a place where
she's gonna slow down, right?

- Yeah.
- All right. Well, there you go.

She slows down, she hangs a right...

...you come shooting out of there
and do what you did to me.

You go ass over teakettle,
you make it a blue-ribbon special.

When she gets out of the car,
you're suffering Saint Sebastian, right?

You're the hammer. You get in her face,
you scare the bejeezus out of her.

Give me your phone.

- It's kind of busy here, don't you think?
- Yeah. Witnesses are good.

Witnesses are pressure, all right?

Now, once you've got her
good and rattled...

...then you call for an ambulance,
but really you're calling for me.

I'm number one on your speed dial,
next to your weed dealer.

You call me, I hotfoot it over here.
I just "happened" to be driving by.

I stop to see what the trouble is,
and this is the important part...

...you don't know me.
We've never met. You got it?

- Sure.
- Okay.

Now, I'm Mrs. K's white knight.
We go mano a mano.

You light into me, okay? Get nasty.

No touching, leave the hair alone...

...but otherwise,
you know, open season.

Yell, stomp, call me a douche bag.

I'm gonna play it cool,
give you back some of the razzmatazz...

...and once she's seen the fireworks,
you fold like a lawn chair. Happy ending.

- When do we get our money?
- After.

- "After."
- After.

You get paid when I get paid.

I'm the rising tide
that raises all dinghies.

Now, pop quiz. What's the car?

- Mercury Sable wagon.
- Baby-poop brown.

- Okay, do you know me?
- No.

Damn straight. Go with God.

Well, I'm just glad
I happened to be passing by.

Happy to be of help, Betsy.
May I call you Betsy?

Please, call me James.

Oh, the kid will be fine. Don't worry.

He just got his bell rung a little.
I'll handle that.

Oh, no.

Oh, no, no. I wouldn't think
of taking your money for this, so...

The embezzlement case?
Yes, I'd be happy to talk it over.

Oh, shit.

Two-minute warning.
Two-minute warning.

Got it.

Oh, my God.

What happened?

Call 911.

Oh, my God. Cal. Cal.

Look at me. Are you okay?
Buddy, say something.

Cal, look at me. Come on already.

What is she doing in there?
She making a sandwich?

Where's her sense of responsibility?

- What?
- What?

Hey. What the...?

Funny to run into you, Betsy.
I was just strolling the neighbourhood.

You were in an accident? Oh, that's...

Come on.

- Yeah.
- She took off on us.

- She what?
- It was textbook, man.

We were diamonds.
But then she just took off.

Okay, wait. She hit and run?

That's what I'm saying.
She bailed and wailed.

Okay, just stay where you are.
I'll come get you.

No, no, no. Screw that, man.
We're following her.

You're... How are...?
You're following her how?

We got our ways, yo.

Okay, okay, okay.
New plan. New plan.

You do know me. I'm your lawyer.
You got that? I'll meet you at the school.

No, she's way past the school.

She hooked a left on Juan Tabo,
now she's coming into Holiday Park.

Okay, stay with her.
When she gets where she's going...

...wherever that is, don't do anything.

- Wait for me.
- Wait for what?

You haven't been right even once.
Slippin' Jimmy my ass.

You fell into the honeypot, kid.
You get it? Hit-and-run is a felony.

- So what?
- "So what?" So more money.

He says we fell in the honeypot.

- He says more money.
- So, what do we need him for?

Cal, Lars, whoever...

Oh, damn it.

Come on, come on.

- Do it, do it, do it.
- Son of a bitch.

Come on. Come on.

- Hey, your leg.
- Oh, I'm gonna do this one.

Okay. Hey. Hey. Yo, hold up.

Hey, yeah, you.
What is the matter with you?

- You hit and run.
- You ran him over.

You felonied my brother.

- Habla English.
- We call... We call la policia.

- La policia gonna be pissed.
- I see you hit him.

You see that windshield? You did that.

- I did that.
- You did that.

- You did that to me.
- Now you pay.

Make with the dinero.

Sí, righteous dinero.

- Okay.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

Okay.

Let's go.

- Is that money?
- Yeah.

Watch the step. Watch the step.

Watch it. Watch the step.

Where are you?

Holiday Park.

Mrs. Kettleman, Betsy,
what are you doing here?

Hit-and-run? That's very serious.

I can mediate.
I represent their parents, so...

Come on, come on.

Open up, officer of the court.

Open up in the name of the law.

Good afternoon, this...
Albuquerpue police. Hello?

We'd like to talk with you for a minute.
Could you open the door, please?

We know you're in there.

You're casting a shadow
through your peep hole.

All we wanna do is talk.
Would you please open the door?

I'd prefer not to, officers.

Sir, come on and open up.

I have a condition.

I can't go outside
or be exposed to what's out there.

You were able to steal
your neighbour's newspaper.

I didn't steal it. I left $5.




The cover price is 50 cents.

Did your neighbour consent
to sell you her paper?

She...

Isn't...?

Officer, let's talk about something
called "probable cause."

As I'm sure you know,
in New Mexico...

...there is a two-part test
to determine whether police...

...have an objectively
reasonable basis...

the situation as Mincey v. Arizona
pointed out...

...create an event...

Hey, Tommy,
come around here, would you?

And that's why the Tenth Circuit
Court of Appeals...

...ruled that a coercive order...

Requiring an individual
to leave his house is seizure.

And therefore protected
under the Fourth Amendment.

Right?

Whole lot of camp stove fuel.

- Guy sure sounds like a tweaker.
- See what he did to the breaker box?

Is he coming out, or are we going in?

You got ten seconds to open this door
or it's coming down, you hear me?

- Final warning.
- Okay, I'll let you in.

But leave your electronic
devices outside.

No phones, no walkie-talkies,
no flashlights.

Definitely, definitely no Tasers.

I can't emphasise that enough. Deal?

Or... Look, look, I'll give the paper back.

Yeah?

James McGill
to see Mr. Richard Sypes.

Ricky. Call me Ricky.

Come on in.

This is my assistant's car.

My Mercedes is in the shop.

Yeah, I ought to give him a raise.
You're right.

Jim, I saw you on the TV.
That billboard thing?

And I had me a pair of insights.

Insight the first:
You ain't afraid to put yourself out there.

And insight the second:
You believe in the real America.

Freedom. Self-sufficiency.

I do. I...

I really do.

When I see a man like you driving
that foreign shitbox of a car...

Well, see, actually...

it's a sign a good man
can't get ahead today.

It's a travesty, that's what it is.

Well, that may be, Ricky.

But I refuse to consider myself a victim.

You know, we are once again
at a point in our history...

...where the fly-swatting hand
of government...

...is crushing the spirit
of entrepreneurship.

Taxes, OSHA requirements.

The INS poking their big fat nose
into every mother-loving hire.

It's damned oppressive.

It's tragic.

It's un-American.

Jim, I think you are just
the lawyer I need.

Because I got me a case.

Major. I say, a major case.

Are you ready to clear your calendar?

Ricky, I'm all ears.

I want to secede
from the United States.

Now, I got 1100 acres of property here.

Self-sustaining
with solar power and wells.

A sovereign state immune
to the business-killing regulations...

...of the country
in which it geographically lies.

We are going to be America's
Vatican City.

Ricky...

...I'm your man.

Yeah. Let's do this.
Let's show them all.

Yes, we are doing this.

Now, it's not gonna be easy.

The government is gonna fight us
tooth and nail.

We could end up in the Supreme Court.
I'm talking thousands of man hours.

I mean, years of effort.

Are you ready for that?

Me?

I say bring them on.

Let's talk turkey.

What's your rate?

Four hundred and fifty an hour.

To hell with hourly.

I want you on retainer.

How about one million even?

Five hundred up front...

...and 500 when we're done.

A million? That seems...

...fair.

Would you like that in cash?

Tax-free and backed
by the full faith and credit...

...of the sovereign Sandia Republic.

It's...

Son.

You are getting in on the ground floor.

Mr. McGill, hi.
Thanks so much for coming.

Roland Jaycox. Roland.

Hey, Roland. Great to meet you.

- You can call me Jimmy.
- Jimmy, absolutely. Hello.

- Please, come on in.
- Well, thank you.

What was it like climbing that billboard?
Must've been pretty scary, huh?

Guy needed help, that's all.

You know? If I can do it, anybody could.

Well, my hat is off to you.

So here we are.

And patent law is something you...?

Oh, yeah. I do so many patent cases...

...I should probably just go ahead
and specialise already.

So, what do we got?

- I feel silly asking this.
- Yeah.

Before I show you my invention...

...you mind signing
a non-disclosure agreement?

You got it. No problem.

It's my idea of a lifetime. If Fisher-Price
or Playskool got their hands on this...

No worries.

You ready?

I may have seen one of these before.

Not like this.

This one has this little unit I've added.
This is my invention.

- Do you have children?
- No.

My wife and I have two boys, 4 and 6.

And let me tell you. Toilet training them?
Nightmare.

Both times. They just didn't
wanna use the commode.

So I wired a motion sensor
to a voice chip.

Well, no sense getting all technical,
but it's all about positive reinforcement.

Meet Tony the Toilet Buddy.

And when you sit down
to do your business...

...this is how he works.

Oh, yeah. That's the way.

Gosh, you're big. You're so big.

My goodness, look at you.

Fill me up, Chandler. Put it in me.

Chandler's my youngest. Loves it.

Give it to me, Chandler. I want it all.

Anyway, it goes on from there.
You get the picture.

Yeah. I...

Yeah.

So, what do you think?

It's a little sexual maybe?

Sexual? What does that...?

Suggestive, maybe?
Maybe that's a better word.

Look, I'm not saying this thing
won't make you rich.

Some wealthier Pacific Rim nations,
they'll love this.

The crazy bastards.

I created this for children.

- Children. Understand?
- Hey.

Viagra was originally invented
to treat hypertension.

Look how that turned out.

You're completely disgusting.

Buddy,
you're the one with the sex toilet.

Get off my property!

Know what?
I hope you do make a fortune.

Because Chandler's gonna need it
to help pay for his therapy.

I found the Alpine shepherd boy.

No, no, you just stay put.

I'll be right over.

Now, where were we?
Oh, would you like some more tea?

No. No, thank you. I'm fine.

Now, the shepherd boy Hummel...

...that's gonna go to your nephew
Clarence?

As long as he finishes college.

If he drops out, it goes to my niece
Raylene.

But then Raylene doesn't get the girl...

The girl with the geese, I know.
That would go to your cousin Helen.

So long as she never
remarries Frederick?

- Exactly.
- Yeah.

And no matter what,
I want the towheaded twins...

...to go to Reverend Laurence's
grandson.

Don't you mean Reverend Haynes?

Reverend Laurence's grandson
is going to get the lute-playing angel...

...because he was in the choir.

Very sharp, Mr. McGill.

And here I thought
all lawyers were idiots.

No, only half of us are idiots.
The other half are crooks.

- Aren't you a spicy one.
- Well...

If I were 40 years younger,
I'd have you buy me a piña colada.

Well, if you want me to draw up a DNR...

...I'll bring a blender
and some pineapple.

I knew I'd like you when I saw...

...how you saved that poor man
on the television.

Moxie is in such short supply
these days.

Yeah, well, I pride myself on my moxie.

Now, I hate to do this, but I do need
to bring up my payment.

And I'm sorry,
but I can't accept S&H Green Stamps.

Now, my fee is $140.

A hundred and forty.

I'll gladly accept 70 today...

...and 70 when I come back
with the completed documents.

Twenty, 40...

...sixty, 80...

...a hundred...

...and 20...

...forty.

Okay.

- Shall we continue, Mr. McGill?
- Yes.

Yes, we shall, Mrs. Strauss.

Put it on the nail, not the skin.

I can't help it if your toes are too small.
They should all be the same size.

Size of the big toe. That one I can do.

Yeah, that would be attractive.

So.

How's it go again?

"You're huge, Chandler.

You're a big, big boy.

Oh, where does it end?"

"Oh, don't stop, Chandler.

Don't stop!

Here it comes."

"Oh, what is that?
Is that a piece of corn?

No, no.

Did you eat corn?

- Is that a niblet I see?"
- Stop. Disgusting.

- No.
- Too much?

Hey, good times.

Even your lousy days are more
interesting than my good ones.

Yeah, we should definitely
do something about that.

Seriously, don't ever try
to make a living at this.

- Stick with the law.
- Yeah.

Because I'm really...

...lighting the world on fire
in that department.

Did two wills today.

Two wills, and I started a living trust.

Old people love me.

Maybe you got a future in elder law.

You think I could handle
all that glamour?

No, I'm serious.

I've thought about getting into elder law
myself.

I watched my grandmother at the end.

It's awful what people have to deal with.

Insurance companies.

My scumbag cousin stealing her savings
and her pain meds.

Getting old sucks.

Seniors need someone on their side.

- It's Howard.
- What the hell does he want?

Hi, Howard.

No. I mean, I haven't...

Oh, my God, when?

Yeah, okay.
I'll see if I can track Jimmy down.

I'll call you back. Sure.

It's Chuck.

Chuck. Chuck, you with me?

Chuck, hey, buddy, it's me!

Hey, can you talk to me?

Crazy sons of bitches.

Hey, hey, sir.

You can't do that.
All of this needs to stay on.

No, no. No electricity, you understand?

No, it needs to be on.
I'm getting security.

No, wait, wait. Wait, wait.
No, wait, wait.

- Why isn't that one going out?
- Stop.

- Damn it.
- Jimmy.

Just... Jimmy, wait a second.

Jimmy, think. What's the plan here?

Sir, sir?

Sir, I need you to get down.

What kind of torture chamber
you running?

- He's allergic to electricity.
- You heard the doc. Get down.

You might as well throw him
into a microwave. Don't touch me.

He is this patient's brother.
Please, listen to him.

- Now, hey.
- Let's go.

Hold on, hold on a second, Edwin.
Sir.

- You ready to calm down?
- His name's Jimmy.

And he is gonna calm down.

- Say the words, Jimmy. I need to hear it.
- I'm calm, okay? I'm calm.

Why don't you go wait in the hallway?

I'll call if we need you.

Okay, so tell me about the electricity.

Look, I know how it sounds,
but it's real. Oh, shit.

My phone. Stuff.
Anything with a battery in it.

- He can't have it near him.
- Hang on.

There's my phone. Okay, that's it.

Thanks.

Okay. What the hell happened?
Why is he here?

It started when Charles
stole his neighbour's newspaper.

What? He never leaves the house.

I don't have all the details.

Police found him
in a very agitated state.

He was confrontational
and incoherent.

How come you didn't call me?

Why did I have to hear about this...

...through my brother's
prick of a law partner?

The only contact information
we could find was a business card.

Jimmy, in my opinion...

...Charles should be committed
for 30 days of psychiatric observation.

As a family member, you can submit
a petition for him to be evaluated.

There's an excellent facility
in Las Cruces.

He can be there tomorrow.

I'd rather not.

Hey, buddy. Hey, I'm right here.

- Oh, hey, Chuck.
- Excuse me.

Mr. McGill, my name is Dr. Cruz.
Do you know why you're in the hospital?

The police kicked in my door.
No warrant.

No cause.

I wasn't incoherent.
They just weren't listening.

They Tasered me, Jimmy.

Oh, Jesus.

Kim?

- I'm sorry, I can give you privacy.
- No, no, no, that's all right. Stay.

Howard called me.
He's very concerned about you.

How are you feeling now, Mr. McGill?

Do...? Do you have a phone
or a pager...

- ...or anything with a battery?
- I don't think so. I...

Yeah.

Oversight. Sorry about that.

Can you tell me a little more
about your...

- ...situation?
- It's not a situation.

It's a condition.

Electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

For reasons unknown, my nervous
system has become sensitized...

...to certain frequencies
of electromagnetic radiation.

Your brother called it
an allergy to electricity.

Well, it's an oversimplification.

But it's essentially correct.

Electronic devices create
their own electromagnetic fields.

The closer I am to such devices...

- ...the worse my symptoms.
- Which are?

Burning sensation on my skin...

...a sharp, cold pain in my bones...

...muscle fatigue, heart palpitations...

...blurred vision...

...tinnitus...

...vertigo, nausea, shortness of breath.

- A general...
- It hurts.

Yes, it hurts.

When did you first experience
these symptoms?

- Must have been...
- You left the office 18 months ago.

Well, in that case,
must have been almost two years.

Two years? That's a...

That's a long time
to live with discomfort.

Well, there it is.

You think I'm crazy.

I never said that.

No, you didn't,
because you're very polite.

But you think it.

Otherwise you wouldn't
be talking about commitment.

- You find that idea distressing?
- Who the hell wouldn't?

I find it inappropriate for a person...

...suffering from a physical condition.

Anyone who's spent more
than a few minutes with me knows...

...that this isn't some kind of delusion.
Wouldn't you agree, Kim?

- Of course she does.
- Well, I'm not a doctor.

You've known me for a decade.

Have you ever seen me exhibit any sign,
any sign whatsoever, of mental illness?

See? If I thought for one second...

...you could cure me, believe me,
I'd jump at the chance.

All due respect,
psychiatry doesn't have the answers.

I'd very much like to try.

Section 43-1-11, part E3.

"The proposed commitment
is consistent...

...with the treatment needs
of the client...

...and with the least drastic
means principle."

Do you think subjecting me to this pain
for a month is the least drastic means?

Might as well spend a month
in a wood chipper.

I understand your frustration. I do.

You're obviously
a highly-intelligent man...

...in difficult circumstances.

May I ask you a question?
Just for my own interest.

Yeah.

How do you meet
the needs of daily life?

What do you do for light?

How do you prepare food?

I use white gas lanterns.
For cooking, I have a camp stove.

I have a large cooler
I keep filled with ice.

It's not ideal, but I make do.

I see.

Well, thank you.

Would you mind if I took a moment
to speak with your brother?

Make sure you still have your wallet
when you're done.

Funny guy.

Jimmy?

I wanna go home.

That was a dirty trick.

That wasn't a trick.
It was a demonstration.

This allergy to electricity isn't real.
It's a manifestation of something deeper.

I'm not saying it's 100 percent real,
but Chuck is smarter than you and me.

So we're not talking him out of this.

And I'm not sending him
to a rubber room.

No one is talking about rubber rooms.

- There are specialists...
- He's seen specialists.

The best doctors.
None of them helped. Not one.

So you're ready to give up?

Who's giving up, huh? I'm...
I'm the one doing the heavy lifting here.

That white gas?
Who do you think brings him that?

And milk, bread, toilet paper
and ice and every other thing he needs.

Is that helping or enabling?

If you testify in a custodial hearing,
he can get help. That's in your power.

To be committed involuntarily,
he has to be a danger to himself.

- Or others.
- And he is.

Coleman lanterns indoors?
A camp stove?

He could burn his house down,
or the entire neighbourhood.

And then you're looking
at a commitment of 10 to 20 years.

What if...? What if he just hurts himself
in a household accident?

How does he call for help?

You have the power
to help your brother.

Truly help him.

Ignoring this won't make it go away.

What would you do?

All I know is...

...he needs help.

Untie him.
I'm getting him out of here.

The nurse will bring you release forms.

Oh, boy.

- Jimmy? Kim?
- I found him.

- I thought I'd wait till you got here.
- Great.

- How's he doing?
- Better. Resting.

Good.

Jimmy, I want you to know
that I've talked to the DA...

...and he absolutely will not sign off
on any commitment papers.

This is a physical condition,
not mental.

Chuck is of sound mind.
I think we can all agree on that.

You're a real peach, Howard.

Of course you don't want
Chuck committed.

No, I don't. Why would I?

If Chuck were committed,
I'd become his legal guardian.

- And I'd cash him out of HHM.
- Jesus, Jimmy. Now?

You wanna hash that out here?

The tanning bed must have
melted your brain if you think...

- Guys, Chuck, that's why we're here.
- Yes.

Let's stay on point.

We're talking about the well-being
of a man whom we all love very much.

There's many factors.

- Spite doesn't have to be one of them.
- I was on the fence till you showed up.

Thanks for helping me decide.
Wave bye-bye to your cash cow...

...because it's leaving the pasture.
I'm committing him.

Jimmy... Ji... Wait.

Jimmy, wait. Jimmy...
Jimmy, can you wait?

Jimmy, wait a second.
Listen, I agree that Chuck needs help.

And maybe it's the right thing to do,
but you can't do it like this.

I just wanna see
that son of a bitch sweat.

It's so obvious what he's afraid of.

I'm taking my brother home.

There you go, buddy.

Yeah, there you go. Okay, some steps.

One and two, and there you go.

Hey, you're home.

All right?
Everything's gonna be all right.

You want something to eat?

Some tea? Cup of tea?

Coffee.

Coffee. Coffee it is.

Jimmy, I'm gonna need my...

I don't... I... I...

Oh, it's...

Yeah.

Wanna talk about this?

Nothing to talk about.

You took the paper,
you saw this, you got sick.

What's your point?

Chuck, I think you got sick
because you saw this story.

Whenever you think
I've done something wrong...

...something questionable,
you get worse.

I didn't get sick because
I read about you in the paper.

I got sick...

...because I went out of my house
to retrieve the paper...

I'm too tired for this argument, Jimmy.

I've had it too many times.

You think this is the return
of Slippin' Jimmy, but it's not.

All right.

You think the billboard thing
was unethical.

But it was promotion.
It was advertising, that's all.

Which wasn't even allowed
until five Supreme Court justices...

...went bonkers
in Bates v. State Bar of Arizona.

But in any event...

...it's legal. If you wanna advertise,
that's your business.

"Business" being the operative word.

Because I have gotten business
off of this.

Legit business. Wills, trusts.

I'm kind of starting to specialise
in elder law.

- Elder law?
- Yeah.

The things the elderly have to deal with.
I mean...

...relatives coming after their savings,
telemarketers...

...reverse-mortgage scams.
I mean, getting old sucks.

Seniors need someone on their side,
so you're looking at him.

Oh, that sounds promising.

But it has nothing to do
with my condition.

Chuck, I'm gonna make you
a promise right now.

Not necessary, not requested.

Okay. The billboard
was a one-time thing.

I'm a good lawyer.
I just needed some razzmatazz.

You know, to get the ball rolling.
Some showmanship.

That's all it was. It's done now.

- It's over.
- All right.

From here on out,
I'm gonna play by the rules.

- As any lawyer should.
- Exactly.

There are clients out there
who need me.

I'm gonna give them the best
representation I know how to provide.

I'm on the up-and-up, okay?
I will be good.

Slippin' Jimmy, he's back in Cicero.
Dead and buried.

Okay.

We'll see.

Where you going?

Somebody's gotta make that coffee.

I'm sure the truth will come out...

...if indeed that's
what we're all interested in.

I know everybody in this courtroom...

...has strong feelings
about Nicholas Baron's past...

...but I submit he is not on trial here
for his past.

He is on trial for the murders
of Donald Kovack and Eddie Alonzo.

Single-breasted.

Light blue or cream.

It's blue.

Linen.

Simple. Single pocket.

Thank you.

Hello there.
James McGill, attorney at law.

- How are you this fine morning?
- I'm just fine. How about you?

Oh, very good. Play fair.

Oh, what do we got here? I see...

...a piece is trying to get away here.

Enjoy the Jell-O.

Get to the bottom.
Wait, who's the banker here?

That's the only one I wanna talk to.
There he is.

- How are you?
- Hey. I'm good.

Whoa, what a grip, young man.

Watch out, that's my will-writing hand.

- I'm quite strong, you know.
- Okay.

Hello, ladies. You look beautiful today.

All right over there?

Very good. Play fair.

No betting.

Wait a second, is that Veronica Lake?

Give me a hug, beautiful.

Yes. You look great today.

All right. No cheating,
no hiding the tablet.

Oh, what do we have here?

Hey, there he is. The man in the booth.

John Wilkes Booth. Booth Tarkington.

What you reading there?

The Complete Annotated Book of Rules
for Parking Validation?

No.

The rules for parking validation
are actually pretty simple.

Most people get it on the first try.

Well, you'll be pleased to know
I have the requisite stickers.

Be still my heart.

And...

...you can have this as well.

I'm doing elder law now.

"Need a will, call McGill."

So give me a call if you...

If you happen to know any elders.

- Good night.
- Couldn't have a bad one if I tried.

- Good night.
- Good night.

Have a good one.

He drove in from El Paso,
but he made good time.

Pick it up on pancakes.

- Eggs over-medium.
- Hash browns.

Eggs over, pick it up.

Don't be so silly.

- There's nobody around.
- You never can tell.

- Then I'll come in.
- I wouldn't.

- We're going to be late.
- Don't be bashful, Lucy.

I'm not bashful,
but I've never kissed you before.

And I don't think this is the place.

Gosh, if you knew how crazy I am about
you, you wouldn't hesitate. I can't sleep.

- Why don't you take some hot milk?
- I must be in love because I started...

Long way from home, aren't you?

You and me both.

Jesus.

It can't be done.

You sure about that?

There's a trick, huh?

There's gotta be. This guy wouldn't
put money on it unless there's a trick.

I'm telling you, it can't be done.

So you give up?

Yeah. All right.

Let's see it.

- Wait, what?
- No way.

- Show me that again.
- Sure. You got another 20?




Screw this.

Don't go away mad.

Oh, hey, guys.
You wanna buy a Rolex?

Whoa, whoa, hold on.
How much for that cheap piece of crap?

- Look what the wind blew in.
- Hey.

Holy crap. Jimmy, my man.
I said you would beat the rap.

- Hey, Merna. Set him up.
- No thanks. I'm good.

No, go on. He don't mean it.
You just got out of jail. Come on.

You're not gonna have a drink?
That'll be the day.

Settle down. I'm in a rush.
My brother's outside in a taxi.

- The meter's running.
- What, Chuck's outside?

Tell him to pull that broomstick
out of his ass and get in here.

No. We got no time.
We're catching a plane.

I came here to say goodbye.




I'm moving to Albuquerque,
New Mexico.

Mexico? You skip bail?

New Mexico. You know, like Bugs Bunny
and the Road Runner.

Okay, yeah.
What are you gonna do there?

I'm gonna work at his law firm,
like in the mailroom. To start, anyways.

Now you're talking crazy. You just got
out of jail. Now you wanna go back?

- Working for him, that's all that is.
- Marco.

I was done, you understand?
I didn't beat the rap.

Chuck flew in and saved my ass.
It's time to make some changes.

Hey. Listen to me.
You're Slippin' Jimmy.

What do you got to change, huh?

Everything. It's time to grow up.

- Yeah, according to who? Chuck?
- The same goes for you, man.

You want to spend the rest
of your life on that stool?

I mean, come on, Marco.
Look at yourself.

All right, that's him. I gotta hit it.

- Jeez. His master's voice.
- Really?

Come on. Go outside. Tell Chuckles
that you got some business you forgot.

- Marco.
- Come on.

You gotta have one last blowout.

We'll do the watch thing again.

But maybe we'll pull that tar-money
scam you were talking about.

Get some girls.

- I made a promise.
- Yeah, you made a promise.

But it was... What do you call it?
under duress.

Look, he got you out of jail, okay?
But he's your brother.

- I mean, what else is he gonna do?
- Marco. Listen to me, all right?

Chuck's not making me do this.

He's giving me an opportunity
and I'm grabbing it.

Gee, it's like watching Miles Davis
give up the trumpet.

What? What does that even mean?

It's just a waste, is all I'm saying.

Look, I'm gonna fly out there.
I'm gonna get settled.

And I'll call you, okay?

All right, Jimmy.

Hey, have a safe flight, all right?

Hey.

Hey.

What's up?

Just waiting to talk to Howard.

Can I ask about what?

I'm taking your advice.
I'm giving the case to HHM.

Why?

The fact
that Chuck doesn't want me here...

...has something to do with it.

I'm so sorry.

- Why didn't you just tell me?
- I just...

I didn't want you hating
your own brother.

How'd you find out? Did Kim tell you?

I figured it out on my own.

It's about time, right?

I brought the Sandpiper stuff with me.
It's down in my car.

I figure your guys
could do the outreach.

If any of those geezers
don't wanna sign with you...

...just give me their names,
I'll talk them into it.

You know, Jimmy,
I never wanted it to go this way.

- If it had been up to me, we would have...
- Howard, I get it.

Your brother's very important
to the firm.

Sorry I called you a pig fucker.

Well...

We owe you some money, don't we?

The of-counsel fee.

I think we discussed 20,000.

That and whatever the common-fund
proceeds of Sandpiper...

...ultimately adds up to,
you'll receive 20 percent of that.

Should be a very nice payday for you
when it comes.

Yep.

I've got something for you too.

It's a shopping list for Chuck.

He's doing better,
but he still needs deliveries every day.

I think he'd be more comfortable
with someone else doing it.

I see.

You don't have to do it personally.
It just needs to get done.

It's pretty straightforward.
The ice is a pain in the ass.

But he needs it. I usually sneak
into a motel and fill a garbage bag.

But you can have whoever you hire
just buy it.

Most important thing
is the newspapers.

The New York Times.
The Wall Street Journal. They're a must.

There's a newsstand on Eubank
that has both of them at 6 a.m.

Which is good. He's an early riser.
The Albuquerque Journal gets delivered.

But somebody still has to bring it in
for him.

You've been doing all of this
every day?

For over a year?

- You'll take care of this?
- Absolutely.

I'll get it done and done right.

I always liked you, Jimmy.

Remember?
I used to call you Charlie Hustle.

Yeah, I remember that.

I'm sorry I yelled at you.

That was nice.

You sure you're all right?

- It's not a crime to let it out.
- There's nothing to let out.

Chuck's a sick man.

That's no excuse.

He's my brother.
He thinks I'm a scumbag.

There's nothing I can do
to change that.

What else is there to say?

Wow, that's mature.

Dalai Lama's got nothing on me.

O-64. As in "Oh, to be 64 again."

O-64.

All right. Next up, we got N-32.

N as in "Nancy Reagan,"
First Lady with a lot of style.

Anybody else seen
Hellcats of the Navy?

All right. No winners yet?

Okay. Here's B-2.

Just like the B-2 bomber,
the Stealth.

Probably one taking off
over at Kirtland right now.

We would never know
because it's stealthy.

Still no winners?

No?

Here we have...

...B-4. Another B.
How about that. As in:

"Before too long,
we're gonna have another winner."

No? Nobody? Okay.

All right.

And here comes...

Hey, it's our old friend B. B-12.

B as in...

B as in...

..."betrayal."

Benedict Arnold
betrayed the United States.

Still no winners?

No?

Okay.

Here it is.

Oh, what are the odds?

Four B's in a row. That's...

B-7.

B as in...

B as in...

..."brother."

Brother.

B-7. Seven brides for seven brothers.

I'm sure a lot of you have brothers.
It's not like mine though.

Any winners yet?
Take another look, okay? I'll wait.

I'm gonna say if it's another B,
we could have a real problem here.

And...

Hey, it is another B.

B-5, as in:

"Boy, this B thing is really
starting to tick me off."

B as in "battleship."
B as in "bourbon." B as in "Belize."

Beautiful place, so I've heard.

I would love to go there, but let's face it,
that's never gonna happen.

None of us is ever leaving
this godforsaken wasteland.

Sorry.

Scratch that.

Moving on?

I mean, what is it with this place?

It's like living
inside an Easy Bake Oven.

I mean, look out that window.

It's like a soulless, radioactive
Georgia O'Keeffe hellscape out there...

...crawling with coral snakes
and scorpions, and...

You ever see the movie
The Hills Have Eyes? It's a documentary.

God forbid, your car breaks down,
you have to walk 10 steps.

You have melanoma the size of a
pineapple where your head used to be.

So you ask, "Why?" Why, if that's
how I feel, why do I live here? Why?

Excuse me.

- Are you gonna read that number?
- Yeah. I'm gonna read your number.

It's another B.

It's another freaking B.
Of course. Why not? Why not?

And the next number...

Quick question. Who here knows
what a Chicago Sunroof is?

Anybody? You, sir? No? Okay.

True story. Back home,
there was this guy named Chet.

Now, Chet was a real asshole.

He might have owed me some money.
He might have slept with my wife...

...before she became my ex-wife.
The details don't matter.

Suffice it to say, I was wronged.

All right. So one summer evening...

...I was out having a few drinks,
one or two, maybe three.

You get the picture.
And who do I see? Chet.

He drove up and he double-parked
outside a Dairy Queen...

...and went in to get some soft serve.
Now, Chet drove...

And this will give you an idea...

...of exactly what kind
of a douche bag this guy was.

Drove a white pearlescent BMW 7 Series
with white leather interior.

So I saw that thing
and I had had a few, like I said.

And...

...I climbed up top and I may have...

...defecated...

...through the sunroof.

Not my finest hour, I'll grant you that.

But that's what a Chicago Sunroof is.
Now you know.

It's a real thing. I didn't make it up.

I'm not the first person to do it.
There's a name for it.

Guy wanted some soft serve,
I gave him some soft serve.

I did not know that his children
were in the backseat.

There was a level of tint on the windows
that I'll maintain to this day...

...was not legal
in an Illinois licensed vehicle.

But somehow, that's on me, I guess.

Who leaves two Cub Scouts...

...in a double-parked car
with the engine running?

Come on.

Now, Chet was connected, see?
Like Cicero, connected.

So usually I'd be looking
at malicious mischief...

...public intoxication,
disorderly conduct, maybe.

But he's got the DA saying
indecent exposure.

Calling me a sex offender. What?

One little Chicago Sunroof,
and suddenly I'm Charles Manson?

And that's where it all went off the rails.

I've been paying for it ever since.
That's why I'm here.

I don't...

You know what?

Any of this stuff you want, come get it.

Kitty-cat notebooks for everybody.

- What can I get you?
- Old Style.

- Make it two.
- You got it.

- What happened to Merna?
- Merna?

She's doing all right.
She's my stepmom.

She don't come in much anymore.

Tell her Slippin' Jimmy says hello.

- Slippin' Jimmy?
- She'll know.

I'll tell her. That'll be 5.50.

Marco.

You gorgeous hunk of a man.

How long will you keep me waiting?

Wake up, you fat son of a bitch.

Bought you a beer.

Jimmy?

In the flesh.

- Come here.
- Hey.

So I'm not dark enough for you, huh?

No, I'm just saying,
I don't see any colour.

I mean, 10 years in a desert,
you should look like...

...Anthony Quinn
in Lawrence of Arabia.

"Turks,
they paid me in golden treasure."

"Yet, I am poor.
Because I am a river to my people."

Hey, I'm Irish, okay?

I spend my time staying out of the sun.

Speaking of pale sons of bitches,
how's your brother doing?

Chuck's fine.

Still working for him?

Sometimes.

What about you? I mean,
besides falling asleep on a bar...

...at 4:00 on a Wednesday afternoon.

- Lake Michigan Standpipe? What's that?
- My brother-in-law owns the company.

Hold it. You got married?

No. No. No.
My sister Angie's husband.

- So, what the hell's a standpipe?
- You know what a standpipe is.

- I don't think so.
- The fire department comes.

Stick one end of the hose
on the hydrant...

...the other on the standpipe.

Water goes out the standpipe,
through the sprinklers.

And then douses the flames.
It's important stuff.

- So that's what a standpipe is, huh?
- Well, it's a dry standpipe.

- There's also the wet standpipe.
- What's the difference?

I don't know if I could explain it
to a layman.

Excuse me. How's your mom?

She passed away
about three years ago.

That's too bad. A great lady.

- Yeah.
- From Wisconsin, right?

Yeah.

The funeral out there?

No, it was here.

Here?

Yeah, well, we were only
in town for a few days, so...

You're in town, you didn't look me up?

Chuck was in the middle
of a big case.

And we couldn't stay around. So...

- Can I get you guys anything else?
- I'm good. Want anything?

Your change here for you.

- Hey.
- Thank you.

How's my Cutlass running?

Gets me around.

Well, it's a classic.

A little bodywork, a paint job,
really be something.

So, what you gonna do
while you're here?

I don't know.
See the sights, you know?

Catch a Cubbies game
from the bleachers.

Get a hot dog at Henry's.

Yeah.

All right.

I'm gonna see them tomorrow.

Yeah, both of them.

Okay.

Okay. Bye.

Is he a regular?

No.

You're buying. I'm selling.

All right, then.

All I'm asking is that you take a look.

I'm sorry, buddy. No offence. I'm just...
You know, I'm not interested.

Come on, man.

What's it gonna hurt to take a look?
It'll take you two seconds.

All right. All right.
Show me what you got.

Boom.

Okay.

You see it?

I see a Kennedy half-dollar.

Which way is he facing?

JFK is facing left.

Exactly.

Which way is he supposed
to be facing?

Right. He's supposed
to be facing right.

Okay. So why is this one facing left?

November 22nd, 1963.

Kennedy is assassinated, right?

The whole nation goes into mourning.

They start naming everything
in sight after him.

The mint wants in on the act.

So in '64, they decide
to change the Lincoln half-dollar...

...into the Kennedy half-dollar.

When they design it, they put
Kennedy facing right, facing east.

Just the way they had Lincoln.
You know why?

East symbolizes the dawn.

That's why pretty much every grave
everywhere faces east.

You know, so the spirit
of the dead person faces the sun.

So that thing. It's a burial thing.

But there's one technician
in the Denver mint, right?

This guy, he believed
in the New Frontier...

...Camelot, the whole deal.

So the assassination,
it just destroyed him.

When he sees that coin
with Kennedy facing east...

...facing the American past,
it pissed him off.

And so he went rogue.

Without telling anybody,
he flipped things around...

...so that Kennedy was facing west
towards the New Frontier, the future.

Now, the mint struck about 3000 of these
before they figured it out.

They canned the guy.

About 1000 of them
made it out into general circulation.

They managed to get most of them back,
melt them down.

But there's still 200 plus
floating around out there.

What's that? I didn't catch that.

I didn't say anything.

You mind, buddy? We're having
a private conversation here.

This one's not in perfect condition.

But on the open market,
I'd say it's worth 6 or 800 bucks.

- Eight-hundred dollars?
- Yeah.

I'm hard up so I'll take $100 for it.

You want me to give you
$100 for a half-dollar?

I want you to give me $100
for an $800 coin.

Yeah, I don't know, man.

I'm gonna go drain the snake.
Think about it.

This guy's playing me, right?

- Definitely.
- Slick son of a bitch.

You know, I should...

You know,
I know this guy on Wabash.

Coin dealer, a friend of my uncle's.

Hey, Joey, can I use your phone?
Local call.

Keep it short.

Let's see.

I'm gonna call this guy.

When he tells me this is a scam,
know what I'm gonna do?

I'm gonna call the cops.

And get this scumbag thrown in the can.
You're my witness, okay?

Facing west.

My hairy ass.

Hey.

How you doing?
Yeah, it's Alvin, Dave Tanner's nephew.

Yeah.

Yeah. That's right.

Hey, this is gonna sound
like the beginning of a bad joke.

But I'm in this bar, and I got this guy
spinning this cock-and-bull story...

...about this 50-cent piece
he's trying to sell me.

He says... He says Kennedy's supposed
to be facing west or something.

Yeah?

Yeah.

- At the tone, the time will be 5:11 p.m.
- Yeah.

That's what he said. Denver.

Jesus, no kidding?

Look. Listen. I gotta go. All right.
Thank you. Yeah, I owe you one.

Thanks, Joey.

- So, what'd he say?
- Yeah, he didn't really know much.

I'll tell you what. I'll give you $50 for it.

Fifty dollars?
I'm taking a bath at $100.

All right. Okay. Look.
I got like $64 right here.

It's an $800 coin, okay?
I'm not gonna sell it to you for $64.

If you wait for me, I'll get you 100 bucks.

I don't know.

Hey, buddy. I got 75 bucks right here.

Hey, I... Sorry. I need a hundred.

Hey, slick, nobody's talking to you.

Mind your own business, okay?
Come on.

Cash money, $80.

Look, if you give me a chance,
I'll be back with $100...

- How long will that be?
- I don't know. Catch a train. Come back.

This guy was getting ready
to call the cops.

- No, I was not.
- Why would you?

- This guy is making shit up.
- Hey, I got 110 here.

- Sold.
- No, no, no.

- This guy's got the cash.
- Don't do that.

- Take care of that. It's history there.
- Hey, you can't do that.

- Money talks. You lost. It's over.
- No, it's not over.

That's crap.
Where do you think you're going?

Back off, dude.

I'll back off
when you give me the JFK back.

Call the cops.
This guy just tried to rip me off.

This guy's a liar.
I did not rip anybody off.

Yes, you did. You come back in here,
your ass is grass. I got friends, buddy.

You hear me?
You double-dealing bastard.

I got friends!

You are so beautiful.

Hey, everybody. Next round's on us.

All right. You listening?

Can you keep a secret?

Yeah. Absolutely.

Okay, his name is Idi Abbassi.

He's 27 years old.
He's a Nigerian prince.

He's worth, conservatively,
$400 million.

The dictatorship
of Equatorial Uqbar Orbis...

...is detaining him
on trumped-up charges.

Now, the Abbassi family,
they're going crazy.

They will reward whoever helps them
get their boy back.

The hitch is
the banks have frozen their...

assets.
I'm talking Irish Sweeps tickets...

...a whole trunk full of them.

They're just sitting at O'Hare,
impounded in customs.

Now, I know what you're saying,
"So what?"

I can leave this as security.

But you got to understand,
this violin is my livelihood.

It's a valuable antique.

What do you mean it doesn't belong
to you? I'll pay 900 bucks for this.

- Cash on the barrel.
- I don't know. I hate to part with it.

- Been in my family for years.
- You can keep a secret?

- Yeah. Absolutely.
- You need a good front.

So you're gonna have the
most return on your dollars.

But I know this customs officer.

- Make it an investment.
- If the price is right.

I'm all about investments,
all about what's coming next.

Hey, kid, help me get my wife's car
out of this bad neighbourhood.

Sir, sir, could you help me?
Tell me, are these today's numbers?

Now, none of this
was strictly legal, right?

And the import taxes
would have been a killer.

He had to find a way to get money into
the country without anyone knowing.

He coated the cash
with this black stuff, vectrol paste.

And the only way to get it off
is with this special chemical.

- It's not cheap, but the upside?
- The upside is huge.

Can you keep a secret?

You know,
the guy in Dances With Wolves?

A guy like you,
who's got some money.

- Got some money to throw around.
- I know, "Who cares?"

No matter which one wins,
we're gonna get a piece.

- He's got a gambling problem.
- Nobody can come after you.

- You get the profit.
- The price is right.

It's a win-win for you.

- It's a lose-lose for everybody else.
- You tell the guy you've got a 14.

- He checks, realises...
- Why we're getting a consortium.

It's just gonna be a piece of the pie.

But you're gonna own
a full mountain range, guaranteed.

- Can you keep...
...A secret?

- Because I really...
...Really shouldn't...

Be telling you this.

Hey.

Hey.

You are not Kevin Costner.

I was last night.

Jesus.

Asshole.

I mean, seriously?

- Oh, Lucianne? Lucianne.
- What?

- He's not Kevin Costner.
- What? So who's this guy?

Not Kevin Costner's manager.

- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay, okay.

Come on.

Get the hell out of this dump.

So are you sure he's not a manager?

Yes, Luci, I am sure.

- He said he was gonna give me his card.
- Does this look like a manager's place?

Can I interest you ladies
in some mimosas?

At least stick around long enough
to get dressed.

- Screw you.
- If you build it, I will come.

- Luci, come on.
- Okay.

Bye.

- Come on.
- That door sticks.

- Yeah, okay. I got it.
- Okay.

- Go. Go.
- Okay.

You have 15 messages.

This is Greta Muller.
I wanted to check to see if my will...

My name's Gary Albert Arnold.
I'd like to discuss making a...

Hi, Mr. McGill.
I'm calling on behalf of my mother.

She's in assisted living and...

Yes, Mr. McGill.
This is Manny Hollinger again.

- Hey, Mr. McGill.
- So, what's it gonna be today, pal?

I'm up for anything and everything.

Marco, I'm sorry. I gotta go back.

What?

It's been great.
And I appreciate your hospitality.

But a week's gonna have to do it.
I gotta go home.

I already called in sick.

Come on, man. This is home.
You hate it out there.

What do you got to go back to?

My clients.

What clients?

What are you,
like a gigolo or something?

Marco.

I'm a lawyer.

What?

Honest to God. I do elder law,
which is like wills and estates.

- So you're ripping off old people?
- No, I'm not ripping off old people.

I'm not ripping off anybody.

Holy crap. Slippin' Jimmy's a lawyer?

No wonder you wanna go back.
I mean, you got to be king of the desert.

Driving around town
in a white Caddy making bank.

I'm not making bank.
I'm making a living, more or less.

A living?

All due respect, you're a lawyer
and you're not making bank...

- ...you're doing it wrong.
- I'm building something. Takes time.

You're gonna build something,
build it here.

- Lawyers in Chicago make plenty.
- I don't know what to tell you, Marco.

- Chuck's in Albuquerque.
- Again, all due respect...

...Chuck's a stuck-up douche bag.

I hate to break it to you,
but he doesn't even like you.

He's my brother.

Okay. I get it.

Family. You gotta go back.

But...

Remember this?

The Rolex thing. Whatever happened
to the guy who used to sell us those?

Jin Kang? He got deported.
This is the last one.

I say we go for it.

- No.
- Come on. Last time, we did what, 600?

The hot streak we're on,
I bet we'd break a grand.

- I could lend you some cash.
- I don't need the money, Jimmy.

I need this.

Come on. You say you're happy
doing wills or whatever.

Good for you, man. Seriously.

But I gotta tell you,
standpipes ain't cutting it for me, man.

I got nothing, Jimmy.

Give me this.

Give me this, man.

- I can't do it.
- Come on. Give me this.

- Marco.
- Give me this. Come on.

- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

- Hey.
- One last time. Come on.

I'm not being hypnotised.

- Okay. Come on. One more time.
- I can't do it.

- Just one more. One more.
- Hey, listen to me.

I'm listening. Come on.

Yeah.

- It's gotta come from the gut.
- Yeah.

Yeah.

Oh, that's crazy.

Just like a wolf. Go ahead.

No, deeper, deeper.

Yeah, and you do that right
at the moment of, you know, pure joy.

- Yeah.
- And it will escalate it...

- ...ten times. There's something...
- Hey.

- It's prehistoric.
- Hey. Hey. Look.

Fifty, two-hundred, four-hundred.

- Whose is it?
- I don't know.

There's gotta be 1000 bucks in here.
Somebody must have...

Oh, damn.

- Is he...?
- I don't know.

Hey, buddy, you with us?

Look, the guy's just had too many.
I say we move on.

You wanna split this?

Marco, you okay?

Marco?

- What, do you know this guy?
- Hey, call 911.

Call 911.

Hey.

I need an ambulance.
My friend's having a heart attack.

We're in an alley southeast
of LaSalle and Shermer.

No, I don't know.
He was like this when I found him.

Hey, hold. Marco?
Marco you with me? You with me?

- I screwed up.
- No, you did good, buddy.

Just hold on, all right?
They're on their way.

They'll be here in a minute.

- Jimmy, you know what?
- Save your breath. You're gonna be fine.

This was the greatest week of my life.

Hey.

Hey, hey, hey. Hang in there. Hey.

Hey, hey. Hey, wake up, man.

Come on. Marco, buddy.

Help!

Anybody.

Marco.

- Hey, Jimmy.
- Oh, hey, Bud.

Can I bum one?

Is that his?

Yeah.

- His mom gave it to me.
- I thought it looked familiar.

I figured I'd wear it today.

But I don't know.
I'm not a big ring guy, so...

Still. Could be worth
a couple of bucks.

Better head back.

See you inside.

- Hey.
- Is this Ferris Bueller?

Speaking.

I don't want to interrupt your big day off.
Just checking in. What are you up to?

- You know, burning down the place.
- I wouldn't expect any less.

So whatever it was,
did you get it out of your system?

- Yep, all gone.
- Good.

I want to run something by you.

The Sandpiper case,
it's getting too big for HHM.

Howard's decided to partner
with another firm.

Davis and Main, you heard of them?

- Sure, up in Santa Fe.
- Right. Well, they've heard of you too.

And they're interested.

They want to make an offer
contingent on an interview.

- They've got a partner-track position.
- Wait. What?

Partner track?
What are you talking about?

There's an office in Santa Fe
with your name on it.

Or there could be.
And you'd be working on your case.

Well, I... I don't even...

- Chuck wouldn't like it.
- Chuck has no say in this.

You wouldn't be working for HHM.

And Chuck can't tell
Davis and Main who to hire.

Why me? Is this like a tax write-off or
a charity thing? What's the angle, huh?

Jimmy,
we've been talking to your clients...

...the Sandpiper residents.

And they ask about you
every chance they get.

I don't know what it is,
but you have a way with them.

Hey. Old people love me.

So sounds good?

Kim, I can't imagine what you did
to make this happen. Thank you.

I didn't do anything much.

And believe it or not,
Howard's been pushing this too.

Good old Howard.

Listen, we're gonna be down in
Judge Murray's court on Thursday at 11.

The Davis and Main people
will be there.

It'd be the perfect chance
for you to meet them.

Thursday at 11. All right.
I'll be there. Thanks, Kim. Really.

I'll see you then.

All the originals
need to be copied and filed.

See, I've written right here
on the box, "copy and file."

- That's to make it as clear as possible.
- Got it, Mr. McGill. Anything else?

Well, on the grocery front,
almost everything was right this time.

- Great.
- Almost.

It's a small thing, but to my taste, the
Granny Smith apples are a bit too tart.

- Those are the green ones, right?
- Right. I prefer the red ones.

But not Red Delicious.
Those are generally tasteless.

Fujis should be in season.
It's not a major issue, but...

Fuji apples. Okay.

Oh, and I'd like to try soy milk.
So maybe a half gallon of that.

You got it.

Well, thank you, Ernesto.
I appreciate your attention to detail.

Do you need to write
any of this down?

Because it's okay if you do.

You know, just to be sure.

So Fuji apples.

- Hey, Ernie.
- Hey, how you doing, man?

Good. Good. So Howard's got you
looking after Chuck, huh?

- Yeah. It's a few extra bucks, you know?
- How's he doing?

Seems okay, like usual.

I'd say we could grab a beer, but they're
waiting on paperwork at the office.

- You know how it is.
- Don't I though?

See you, Jimmy.

See you around, Ernie.

You done business with him before?

Right.

Yeah. I'll be there.

Davis and Main and McGill.

Great to meet you.
Nice to meet you, gentlemen.

It's good to meet you.

Nice.

Well, that was quick. No charge.

Help me out here.

Did I dream it or did I have
$1,600,000 on my desk in cash?

When I close my eyes, I can still see it.

It's burned into my retinas
like I was staring into the sun.

No one on God's green Earth
knew we had it.

We could have split it 50-50.

We could have gone home
with $800,000 each, tax free.

Your point being?

Why didn't we? What stopped us?

I remember you saying something
about doing the right thing.

I don't even know what that means.

You want to know
why I didn't take that money?

Is that what you're asking?

Yeah, that's what I'm asking.

Me, personally,
I was hired to do a job. I did it.

That's as far as it goes.

Yeah. Well, I know what stopped me.

And you know what?

It's never stopping me again.
