Hello, friend.

Hello, friend?

That's lame.

Maybe I should give you a name, but that's a slippery slope.

You're only in my head.

We have to remember that.

sh*t.

It's actually happened, I'm talking to an imaginary person.

What I'm about to tell you is top secret, a conspiracy bigger than all of us.

There's a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world.

I'm talking about the guys no one knows about, the guys that are invisible.

The top 1% of the top 1%, the guys that play God without permission.

And now I think they're following me.

[brakes screeching]

This is about last night.

I should've gone to Angela's birthday party.

Instead, I went to...

woman: Hey, Ron.

There you go.

You're Ron.

But your real name is Rohit Mehta.

You changed it to Ron when you bought your first Ron's Coffee Shop six years ago.

Now you got 17 of 'em with 8 more coming next quarter.

May I help you with something?

I like coming here 'cause your Wi-Fi was fast.

I mean, you're one of the few spots that has a fiber connection with gigabit speed.

It's good.

So good, it scratched that part of my mind, part that doesn't allow good to exist without condition, so I started intercepting all the traffic on your network.

That's when I noticed something strange.

It's when I decided to hack you.

Hack...

I know you run a website called Plato's Boys.

Pardon me?

You're using Tor networking to keep the servers anonymous.

You made it really hard for anyone to see it, but I saw it.



The onion routing protocol, it's not as anonymous as you think it is.

Whoever's in control of the exit nodes is also in control of the traffic, which makes me... the one in control.

I must ask you to kindly leave.

I own everything. All your emails.

All your files.

All your... pics.

Get out of here right now, or I'll call the...

Police?

You want them to find out about the 100 terabytes of child pornography you serve to your 400,000 users?

Personally, man, I was hoping it was just gonna be some BDSM stuff.

You realize how much simpler that would have been?

I did not hurt anyone.

I never did.

That's my... personal life.

I understand what it's like to be different.

I'm very different too.

I mean, I don't jerk off to little kids, but...

I don't know how to talk to people.

My dad was the only one I could talk to.

But he died.

I'm sorry to hear that.

How did he pass, may I ask?

Leukemia.

He definitely got it from radiation at the company he worked at, though I couldn't prove it.

Now he's dead.

Company's fine, though.

[sobs]

Oh... hey.

It's okay, Rohit.

You don't have to worry anymore.

I don't understand.

Are you blackmailing me?

So that's what this is about... money.

That's all you care about, huh?

No.

If I pay you now, you'll want more and more.

No matter how much I give.

You will inform the police anyway.

I won't pay you, sir.

Remember, you also broke the law.

Actually, you're right.

Partly.

See, I usually do this kind of thing from my computer, but this time I wanted to do it AFK.

In person.

Trying to work on my social anxiety.

But there's always the threat of you fleeing after I call you out.

You'd tell your sys admin to take your servers down, wipe all the data.



So I made sure to include the current time and... and location on my anonymous tip.

Wait. Hold on. I'll give you the money.

I'll pay you.

How much do you want? I'll pay you.

That's the part you were wrong about, Rohit.

I don't give a sh*t about money.

Elliot: Now I'm being followed.

The higher ups don't like someone with my powers.

In three short minutes, I destroyed a man's business, life, existence.

I deleted him.

Hey!

Hey, you. Hey, kiddo.

What's happening?

Exciting time in the world right now.

Exciting time.

Elliot: But I'm only a vigilante hacker by night.

By day, just a regular cyber security engineer, employee number ER28-0652.

man: Elliot!

In here.

What's up?

El.

[overlapping chatter]

All over the price... Yeah, I can totally... I can totally handle it.

They were hacked again last night.

Gideon...

Elliot: That's my childhood friend Angela.

She can be a bit high strung sometimes, but trust me... she's one of the good ones.

What am I looking at?

Is this the log file?

This was a RUDY attack.

This is awesome.

Gideon, will you answer me?

Awesome?

You think this is awesome? This is k*lling us, Elliot.

Gideon, I'm not...

Angela!

Let's just see how this meeting goes today.

Their networks are getting attacked every week.

Who knows if they'll still even be a client.

They're coming in?

Hey, what did we say about the dress code?

All right, now, look over those logs.

And be ready this afternoon in case they have any questions.

Okay?

Okay.

Start smoking again?

Did you not get my texts last night?

I sent you exactly 13 of them.

Yeah, I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.

You promised me that you were gonna try this time.

[muffed pop music]

♪ ♪

Stop thinking about something else when I'm talking to you.

I hate when you do that.

Sorry. I was thinking about work.

Maybe that's why Gideon loves you so much.

He thanks me all the time for bringing you in.

But for some reason, I think you secretly hate it here.

Elliot: She was right. I liked most of the people, but our business, a cyber security firm that protects corporations... I can't think of anything I hate more.

No, I love it here.

[both chuckle]

I'm sorry. I'm just in a bad mood.

I'm late on my last two student loan payments, and I can't get Gideon to give me a raise.

Hey...

Hi.

Yo, buddy. Missed you last night.

Where were you?

Gotta go. Big meeting today.

Did you find out what happened?

Yeah.

He said he was working.

Oh, come on. You gotta talk to him.

We're gonna be late for the staff meeting.

He can't stand me. And you know why.

Angela, I can't have that kind of negativityin my life.

That's exactly what I'm talking about.

woman: What are you thinking about?

Nothing.

You want to know what I'm thinking about?

First time you came to me.

Elliot:I didn't exactly come to Krista.

I was forced here. But I do like her.

Hacking her was simple. Her password: Dylan 2791.

Favorite artist and the year in which she was born, backwards.

Though she's a psychologist, she's really bad at reading people.

But I'm good at reading people.

My secret: I look for the worst in them.

I know she went through a divorce four years ago.

I know she was devastated by it and has been dating losers on eHarmony ever since.

Her most recent foray... Michael Hansen.

I searched for him online, but nothing came up.

No LinkedIn, no Facebook, nothing.

Something about him bugs me, scratching that part of my mind again.

But I'll hack him soon enough. I always do.

I know you're not yelling like before, which is good.

But I can tell you're still holding on to it.

And we need to work on your anger issues, Elliot.

You're angry at everyone, at society...

Elliot: F... society.

I know you have a lot to be angry about, but keeping it to yourself and staying quiet like you're doing... it's not going to help you.

There's pain underneath. That's where our work needs to go.



What is it about society that disappoints you so much?

[tense music]

Oh, I don't know.

Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man, even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children?

Or maybe it's that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit.

The world itself's just one big hoax.

Spamming with our running commentary of bullshit masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy.

Or is it that we voted for this?

Not with our rigged elections, but with our things, our property, our money.

I'm not saying anything new. We all know why we do this, not because Hunger Games books makes us happy but because we wanna be sedated.



Because it's painful not to pretend, because we're cowards.

F... society.

[Krista, echoing]

[normal voice] Elliot. You're not saying anything.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Don't be frustrated.

Why shouldn't I be?

You're different than most.

You at least try.

You at least understand.

Understand what?

What it's like to feel alone.

You understand the pain.

You want to protect people from it.

You want to protect me from it.

I respect that about you.

Why do you think I know what it's like to feel alone?

Elliot: sh*t! From her emails!

Elliot?

I don't know.

Let's talk about last night.

Did you go to Angela's birthday party?

[pop music playing]

Yeah. It was nice.

Did you try to talk to anyone?

Sure.

I got a girl's number.

You did?

[chuckles]

She's cute.

She likes The Hunger Games.

You're hiding again, Elliot.

When you hide, your delusions come back.

It's a slippery slope.

Let's talk about the men in black you've been seeing.

Are they still there?

No, I... told you they're gone.

The meds you gave me Yo, man.

Do you wanna, uh... you wanna do lunch today?

Uh, yeah...

I got other plans.

Other plans. Right.

That's... what you said the last three times I asked you.

Look, bud, you... and Angela have been close for a long time, and that's even more reason why I want us to be on good terms.

I... I just... I feel like things have been awkward between us.

Don't you?

I'm okay with it being awkward between us.

[laughs]

Um, yeah. I... I'm... I'm not okay with that.

Um... look, man, I love Angela, and I want us to... to get along for her sake. I mean, that's what I'm... that's what I'm here for. I just, I...

I don't normally do stuff...

Elliot: Am I crazy not to like this guy?

Among some of his Facebook likes are George W. Bush's Decision Points, Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, and the music of Josh Groban.

Must I really justify myself any further?

I'm working on that sh*t, you know?

His was the easiest to hack. Password was 123456Seven.

I witnessed his first "I love you" with Angela over Gchat, then I witnessed the first of many infidelities with Stella B.

I've never done anything like this before...

I've thought about telling Angela, but she has shitty taste in men, and I'm not quite ready to see what comes after this just yet.

You like music. I like music.

Maroon 5.

Plus I can manage Ollie easier than the others. for now, anyway.

And that's all I mean. [sighs]

I just want you to know that.

I like you, bro, and...

I want you to like me too.

I understand.

I'll try harder.

That's cool, man.

Hey, whenever you're ready, I'd love to just... chill.

Oh... forgot about your... no touching thing.

Truth is, I shouldn't hate Ollie; he's not that bad a guy.

He's too dumb to be bad.

In fact, when I think about the really bad people...

[tense music]

E Corp, the largest conglomerate in the world... they're so big, they're literally everywhere.

A perfect monster of modern society.

The E might as well stand for Evil.

woman: And all of life's necessities...

Elliot: In fact, after a thorough, intensive self-reprogramming, that's all my mind hears, sees, or reads when they pop up in my world.

woman: That was have to offer.

Together, we can change the world, with E...

Elliot: Evil Corp.

Krista would have a sh*t fit if she knew I did that.

But that's what they are... a conglomerate of evil.

And now I have to help them.

There are six on-site engineers on your account.

Plus a few off-site...

There he is, Terry Colby, the CTO.

Even though he's the head technology guy at one of the biggest companies in the world, he owns a Blackberry.

So this is it right here.

But also looks like he doesn't see a terminal very often He's not a techie. He's a moron.

An arrogant moron. The worst kind.

[keys clicking]

Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick.

I'm Senior Vice President, Technology.

Elliot. Just a tech.

Don't be so humble.

You know, I started out exactly where you are, and... to be honest, you know, my heart is still there.

So I see you're running Gnome.

You know, I'm actually on KDE myself.

I know this desktop environment is supposed to be better but... you know what they say.

Old habits... they die hard.

Elliot: An executive running Linux with...

Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

I'm an executive. I mean... why am I even running Linux?

Again... old habits.

It's gonna be fun working with you.

I should join the rest of the group.

Bonsoir, Elliot.

Sometimes I dream of saving the world.

Saving everyone from the invisible hand, one that brands us with an employee badge.

The one that forces us to work for them...

The one that controls us every day without us knowing it.

But I can't stop it.

I'm not that special.

I'm just anonymous.

I'm just alone.

If it weren't for Qwerty, I'd be completely empty.

I hate when I can't hold in my loneliness.

This crying has been happening too often, every other week now.

What do normal people do when they get this sad?

They reach out to friends or family, I think.

That's not an option.

I do morphine.

The key to doing morphine without turning into a junkie is to limit yourself to 30 milligrams a day.

[inhaling] Anything more just builds up your tolerance.

I check every pill I get for purity.

I have 8 milligram Suboxone for maintenance in case I go through withdrawals.

sh*t! I'm out again.

On the house.

No, Shayla. Not doing that.

Okay? This is just a regular drug deal like it always is.

Fine.

Worst DDoS attack I've ever seen.

Did you reconfigure the DNS?

Yes!

Gideon: What's the status update?

Is here. I thought we set up security protocols so that this doesn't happen.

[keys clicking]

Where's the attack coming from?

Everywhere, obviously.

The USA, Finland, Thailand, Kuwait...

Start restarting the services, load sharing, redirect the traffic. Call Prolexic for help.

Wait. What?

I don't think this is just a DDoS attack.

I think they got a rootkit sitting inside the servers.

What's a rootkit?

It's like a crazy serial r*pist with a very big d*ck.

Jesus, Lloyd.

Sorry. It's malicious code that completely takes over their system. It can delete system files and stop programs. Viruses, worms...

How do we stop it?

That's the thing.

It's fundamentally invisible... you can't stop it.

All of their servers are timing out.

None of them are coming back up.

That's because every time we restart the server the virus replicates itself during boot up and crashes the host.

How are we supposed to bring up the network if we can'trestart the servers?

We can't.

Which is what they wanted.

By defending ourselves, we ended up spreadingthe virus everywhere.

Only thing we can do is we've gotta take the whole system offline, wipe the infected servers clean, then bring them back up.

Yeah.

You're gonna frame him? No one's gonna believe that.

I met him, he's a moron.

So are the FBI.

Even if they don't believe he did it, they'll believe he gave someone access to it.

Yeah, he'll just go to jail.

What good will that do?

You don't take down a conglomerate by shooting them in the heart.

That's the thing about conglomerates, they don't have hearts.

You take them down limb by limb.

And as they unravel, their illusion of control unravels.

Who are you?

That'll come later.

Right now, you have a lot to think about.

You have to change the dat file and put Colby's IP in there.

You do that, you have set in motion the largest revolution the world will ever see.

So, what do we got?

So, if you'll take a look at the first page of your agenda...

You're the one who stopped the hack.

Colby: You know, the gals in analysis said this was a tough one.

All things being equal, it should have shut us down for days, so... you did good.

Okay.

Gideon: We should start with our account executive, Angela.

Okay, we first noticed the breach at 2:07 A.M. Eastern Standard on Friday night.

You mean, Saturday?

Sorry, yes, technically, Saturday morning.

Yeah, okay, Angela, that's what we're here for.

The technicals.

Right.

Yes. Anyway, he arrived at the office at 2:35 and I instru...

Okay, wait, wait, wait.

So that's almost a half hour after the initial breach.

Why didn't anyone pipe in from their laptops?

It's not protocol...

It wouldn't have been secure if someone terminaled in on this.

It was the smarter move to have someone come in so they can log in on a secure line.

Exactly.

Then Lloyd was able to...

Just... just actually, just one second.

[indistinct whispering]

Yeah.

Colby: You know, I, uh, I always loved this view.

Colby: Now that that's taken care of, let's pick it up where we left off.

What happened to Angela?

She knows more about what happened.

She's not going to work out for us, not on this level.

We need to stick to the more tech savvy here.

Now, let's get to the heart of this thing because I can't sit here and look through a packet for the next 20 minutes.

All right, just who did this? Is it that hard?

Who did this?

I found the configuration file of the rootkit with a pattern of IP addresses.

Once you decrypt it, you'll know where the hack came from.

Elliot: 19 days.

No news, no arrests, no revolution.

No FBI, Colby, Evil Corp.

No Mr. Robot.

No fsociety.

I need to take my mind off things.

[phone trilling]

Michael: Hello.

Hi, this is Sam from Bank of E security fraud department.

Unfortunately I have to inform you that your account's been compromised.

Michael: What? What happened?

First before I can answer any questions, I need to verify some information.

Are you still at 306 Hawthorne Avenue?

Michael: Yes. Apartment 2C.

Great. And your security question, favorite baseball team?

Michael: Um, Yankees.

I don't remember this being a security question.

And lastly, your pet's name?

Michael: Um, Flipper.

Who am I speaking to? Can I get your name and number?

Elliot: With those details plus a dictionary brute-force attack, it'll take my program maybe two minutes to crack his password.

What I wouldn't give to be normal.

To live in that bubble, the reality of the naive.

That's how I justify this.

To keep their optimism intact.

To protect them.

[computer beeping]

How? He's too old to have a complicated password.

It had to have been a combination of these things.

I'm missing something, I'm missing something, I'm missing something.

Michael Hansen isn't his real name.

Come on. Get over here.

Elliot: Lenny Shannon?

Michael Hansen?

Which one are you playing tonight?

Elliot: You're going to stop seeing Krista.

What the f...

You're going to break up with her. You're never going to see her again.

You're the guy that used my phone.

You cheated on your current wife with seven different women.

I got digital proof of all of it.

Ashley Madison, online escorts, fake Facebook pages.

I own it all.

And if you don't stop seeing her, your wife will know everything along with the police.

The police?

Yeah, one of the escorts was 15.

Elliot: That 15 part I made up, but he did have a proclivity for young escorts that helped the lie.

But I'm not gonna do any of that as long as you break up with Krista.

Tonight.

Done.

You're also gonna tell her the truth.

That you're married, cheat on your wife, you hire hookers.

That you never had any intention of being serious with her.

Why?

That would destroy her.

She thinks that...

We're in love.

Elliott: Exactly. Krista needs to avoid dickheads like you in the future.

Her radar needs fixing.

I'll know if you skip any detail.

So don't.

And one more thing...

I'm gonna need something from you.

Come on.

We're trying to penetrate a data security facility whose tagline literally is...

Nothing is actually impenetrable.

People always make the best exploits.

I've never found it hard to hack most people.

If you listen to them, watch them, their vulnerabilities are like a neon sign screwed into their heads.

Mobley's a glutton.

He lacks discipline from his urges.

I don't want to get bugs. They spread disease.

Elliot: Romero is a know-it-all and a hypochondriac.

Mobley: Bill Harper is our first exploit.

He isn't gonna give the search much scrutiny.

He'll get us to Level 1, but Bill is not gonna be able to get us to Level 2.

And we need to get to Level 2.

You're gonna ask to speak to his supervisor, Wendy.

She'll get us to exactly where we need to be.

Then we'll be able to get rid of her from the van.

After that, you connect the Raspberry Pi to the climate control system, and Bob's your uncle.

Elliot: My father picked me up from school one day, and we played hooky and went to the beach.

It was too cold to go in the water, so we sat on a blanket and ate pizza.



When I got home, my sneakers were full of sand, and I dumped it on my bedroom floor.

I didn't know the difference.

I was six.

My mother screamed at me for the mess, but he wasn't mad.

He said that billions of years ago, the world shifting and the oceans moving brought that sand to that spot on the beach, and then I took it away.

"Every day," he said, "we change the world," which is a nice thought until I think about how many days and lifetimes I would need to bring a shoe full of sand home until there is no beach, until it made a difference to anyone.

Every day, we change the world, but to change the world in a way that means anything, that takes more time than most people have.

Among the countries are Lithuania, Croatia, Ukraine, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Estonia.

Where's Tyrell?

We made a deal that helped us both.

Tell me where he is!

You're starting to attract some attention.

I recommend you get one of those Bluetooth headsets.

That way people just think you're the local douche.

Tyrell disappeared.

No one knows where he is.

But you know.

The dramatic repercussions of the recent financial meltdown are not relegated to developing nations.

The United States has also witnessed a disruption of order and peace.

All right, go.

Why me?

Why am I really here?

I know you know who I am.

He was not a very good person.

He had a gambling problem.

He drank too much.

Most notably, he was weak.

His instincts left a lot to be desired.

Oh, I despise people like that.

In fact, I felt... the world was a little better off knowing he wasn't in it anymore.

Oh, I believe even his family will benefit from this in the long run.

Real? You want to talk about reality?

We haven't lived in anything remotely close to it since the turn of the century.

We turned it off, took out the batteries, snacked on a bag of GMOs while we tossed the remnants in the ever-expanding dumpster of the human condition.



We live in branded houses trademarked by corporations built on bipolar numbers jumping up and down on digital displays, hypnotizing us into the biggest slumber mankind has ever seen.

You have to dig pretty deep, kiddo, before you can find anything real.

We live in a kingdom of bullshit, a kingdom you've lived in for far too long.
