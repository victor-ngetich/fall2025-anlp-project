Open the bloody door!
What in the world?
This is Lyra and Pantalaimon.
Asriel, I hereby invoke the privilege of Scholastic Sanctuary!
Scholastic Sanctuary?!
Jordan College is a place of learning, it's not suitable for a child!
Outside of the college, she is not safe.
I have no choice.
I have no choice!
You keep her safe!
Lyra, the rules are simple.
We know the rules, Pan.
You don't obey the rules.
It doesn't mean I don't know 'em.
We need to win this time.
Just count us down.
Three, two... one.
Oi! Cheat!
Lyra!
Sorry, Mrs Woodbridge!
I'll help you clean it later!
( Mouse squeaks )
Mind yourself!
Lyra!
Lyra! Class!
Phys-ed, Master! Sharpen the body, sharpen the mind!
( They laugh ) Roger! This way. I know a short cut!
Are you sure?
Lyra! Lyra, will you wait?
That's the last time I listen to you, Salcilia!
Lyra!
Cheat! You know I hate it down here!
Lyra?
Lyra?
Boo!
( He gasps, she laughs ) These coffins have got skeletons in them.
All coffins have got skeletons in them, Roger, that's sort of the point!
Yeah, but I can see these skeletons!
Only the ones with the open caskets.
Makes you wonder what's inside the ones that are closed.
I wasn't thinking that. No. Why do daemons disappear when you die?
And yet humans leave these nasty skeletons behind?
Do you ever think about what animal Pan will settle as when he stops changing form?
I think about it.
Pan and I talk about it.
Pan thinks he will be a lion.
I don't!
I think he'll settle as a sloth, or a guinea pig.
You said you wanted something cunning, like a fox.
And you? What do you think Salcilia will settle as? Oh. A house marten or a house cat?
Then let's drink on that.
Drink?
Lyra!
Lyra!
We should go, the storm is upon us.
Not yet.
We should have enough time.
I need one more!
We have to find us a way off the mountain.
Pack up. Quickly.
Yes, yes, all right!
Favour your right side down the face.
Thorold! This is the one! I think we've got it!
I know the Magisterium have never ventured this far north, but really, I feel we are... We're pushing our luck here. Jordan College are going to take some convincing.
I have to be certain of what we have before I stand in front of them.
Come on. Here we are.
Are your hands clean?
Yes, sir.
There we go.
We'll let the storm blow itself out.
It's finally time for us to put on a show for the scholars.
Online TV streaming services
We'll head south in the morning.
But we're taking a friend. If I can't convince them, he will!
Eyes will be opened and your daemons will assume their true form and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. Lyra, if you could try to stay awake?
I am. I'm listening, I'm listening.
I'm a god, knowing good and evil.
"As" gods, Lyra.
The Magisterium wouldn't approve of blasphemy.
I thought we were protected by Scholastic Sanctuary?
Yes. A privilege we had to earn and one we must not abuse.
Without Scholastic Sanctuary, you wouldn't be here and nor would I.
You would do well to remember that, Lyra.
Lyra! It's your uncle.
Now then, where were we.
Ah, yes.
Finally, I'll get to go to the North with him. Lyra, don't do anything stupid. Librarian, will you read me that fascinating piece on the serpent's motivations in the Garden of Eden again?
I don't exist to entertain you, Lyra.
And the Magisterium wouldn't approve...
Please.
Where is it? Ah, yes.
We put it up here, didn't we?
Now, where is it?
Ah, there we go.
Ah, thank you, Serena.
There you go.
Lyra?
Lyra!
( Knocking ) So, this isn't stupid?
All right, you've had your fun.
Not yet I haven't.
He's here.
Asriel... it's time.
No, Lyra, don't! The Retiring Room is expressly forbidden.
Not for family reunions.
All right, that was close.
Is this the Tokay?
Yes, Master.
The 1938, as you ordered.
Lord Asriel was most partial to that, as I remember.
Good. Now leave me, please.
Um...
Do it!
Now!
Pan.
We don't know what he put in it.
If it was innocent, why did he send the butler away?
The Master's a good man.
He's always been kind to us.
He's poisoning my uncle, Pan.
The Master ordered it decanted especially for you, my Lord.
Ren, I wasn't expecting to be disturbed!
There are only three dozen bottles left of the '38.
All good things pass away.
Oh.
( Animal growls ) Oh. My Lord.
We should rest.
If this evening goes as expected, we won't sleep for a while.
( Lyra gasps ) Lyra? Lyra, what the hell are you doing?
Let go of me and I'll tell you.
I will break your arm first.
The wine was poisoned!
I saw the Master poison your wine!
You saw him?
Yes.
He added white powder and...
Pan thinks it's me being dramatic, but...
You see? I ain't lying.
Why would the Master poison you?
I thought he was our friend?
( Pan squeals )
That was clumsy, wasn't it? Yes.
Someone tries to kill you and you just destroy the evidence?!
Keep your voice down!
Someone probably tries to kill me and, yes, I destroy the evidence.
Surely you should be doing something.
I am doing something.
I'm wondering why the Master would want to do that to me.
I'm sure he had a good reason.
To be honest with you, if I were him, I'd be afraid of me.
I have waited for over a year to see you!
For nothing.
You're infuriating!
And you're tenacious. At least you used to be.
Now, do you want a job?
No! You might find it a little bit cramped in there.
I don't want a job.
I want you to spy on the Master.
Everything he does.
But particularly whenever Dust is mentioned.
Do you think you can do that?
But...
Quickly, someone's coming. Good girl.
Come on, quickly now!
If you make a noise, I will not save you. You're on your own.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Bit of an accident, I'm afraid.
Such a shame.
Only three dozen bottles left, apparently?
Whatever we discuss this evening will remain private.
          ALL Hear, hear.
Even from the Magisterium.
Jordan College will not become a channel for gossip, rumours and dangerous controversy.
The pursuit of knowledge and our academic freedom is too precious to risk.
          ALL Hear, hear.
Lord Asriel. Thank you, Master.
As some of you already know, I set out for the North some 12 month ago on a diplomatic mission to the King of Lapland.
At least, that's what I was pretending to be doing.
In actual fact, my real aim was to go further north still, right on to the ice, to try and discover what had happened to the Grumman expedition. This is the first of the discoveries I made.
I took this photogram with standard silver nitrate emulsion.
However, I took two photograms that day... the second one with a specially prepared emulsion.
Where does that light come from?
It isn't light.
It's Dust.
What?!
Dust?!
It can't be!
          PAN What's Dust?
          LYRA Shh, I need to see what he's showing them. Gentlemen, it is Dust!
It registers as light on the plate because particles of Dust react with this emulsion in the same way that photons of light react with the standard silver nitrate emulsion. As you can see, the figure of the man is now perfectly visible.
But I'd like you to turn your attention to the child.
We can't see the child clearly because the child does not attract Dust, which, given the nature of Dust, is precisely the point, is it not? We, as adults, are surrounded by Dust.
In fact, we're almost consumed by it.
But children, it seems, are not.
Gentleman, I believe this is proof that Dust is exclusively attracted to adults.
Just as the Magisterium has always suspected.
My next discovery, however, may be considered even more heretical.
Asriel! Be very careful!
That's only where it begins to get exciting, Master.
In one of his last messages to the Academy in Berlin, Grumman made reference to a certain natural phenomenon only seen in the lands of the North. I believe this is what he was referring to.
I took this photogram a few days ago.
The Aurora, the Northern Lights.
Yes, that's right.
When seen with the ordinary emulsion.
But I'd like you to look at it again using mine.
A city in the sky.
( Excited chatter )
Pan, it's beautiful.
          ASRIEL A myriad of worlds, of which the Magisterium controls only one.
A myriad of worlds made visible only through that most distasteful of substances... Dust!
Clear the room! None of us can hear this!
I'm afraid you have to hear this, Master. These are heretical discussions!
Necessary discussions. I believe Grumman found evidence of these multiple worlds and he paid for it with his life! His life?
I found his body preserved in the ice off Svalbard.
I brought back his head as befits a scholar of this college!
I believe you knew him best, Sub-Rector?
My eyes are not very clear and the ice is dirty, but it could be Grumman.
Who would have done this?
It's most likely the Magisterium trying to mask their tracks, to keep us safely innocent, or as the Master would have it, academically free.
Gentlemen, there is a war raging right now between those trying to keep us in ignorance and those, like Grumman, willing to fight for the light, to fight for true academic freedom.
Gentlemen, he was a member of this college, his work was profoundly important and I need funding to continue it. Who will stand against me?
( Music plays )
WOMAN ( SINGS )
♪ Rejoice for your path is secure ♪

♪ For all the journeys to be endured ♪
♪ Rejoice for your path is decided ♪
ALL
♪ You and daemon back to the flame, undivided. ♪ We are here... to give thanks and tribute.
My son's daemon... has settled as a hawk.
( Cheering )
Lyuba... soul, companion and protector of my son... I welcome you in your settled form to my family, my boys and my trust. This ring confirms the settling of your daemon and your transition from child to man.
( Cheering ) Who here will help guide Lyuba and Tony?
Sura and I will.
( Cheering ) Thank you, Benjamin De Ruyter!
( Whistling and cheering ) As symbolised by the ring, forged from the silver that all you families donated...
Pleasure.
Happy to.
Yes.
... we ask that you uphold the Gyptian ways.
Others may see us as outcasts but we are one unified family, and so we ask... you and Lyuba to protect and fight for the freedoms of all, no matter what may stand in our path.
( Crowd shouts out in agreement )
Do you both... accept our ways?
We do.
Yeah, we do, we do.
( Crowd cheers ) Oh, I'm losing my little boy.
Ma, don't say that.
Oh, both my little boys.
He's been following me and pestering me all day and night, before the ceremony.
You became a man tonight.
Well done, Tony.
Thank you.
He stayed a boy.
He wants to know you're still his big brother.
Of course I'm still his big brother.
Go on, go.
Catch Billy and... and tell him.
Ratter, what is it?
Ratter, no!
Have you seen Billy?
Billy, where are you?
Billy, are you out here?
Get off. Aargh!
Help!
Help!
( Soft growling )
( He clears his throat )
( Growling ) The girl.
What?
Oh, yes.
Did they vote to give you the money?
Now you wake up!
( He sighs ) Yes, they did.
What's Dust?
It's nothing to do with you.
It is to do with me.
You told me to spy for you.
Now you have to tell me what I was spying about.
Lyra, there are things that...
There are such things... that you're better off not understanding just yet.
Can I see the man's head?
No!
Why would I let you do that?
The Master... can we still trust him?
I don't trust anyone.
Go to sleep, Lyra.
Take me North with you.
Goodnight, Lyra.
I have no idea how but he knew.
He spilt the decanter himself.
Forgive me, Master, but I can't help being relieved.
I was never happy about the idea.
Of murder.
Hardly anyone would be happy with that idea, Charles.
But the balance of Jordan College was at stake.
There is a great change coming that will threaten us all.
And the alethiometer warns of appalling consequences should Asriel continue his research.
Apart from anything else, the child will be drawn in...
This is about Lyra?
Yes.
She has a part to play in all this, and a major one.
The irony is she has to do it all without realising what she's doing.
But she's just an innocent girl!
And she needs to stay one... which has meant protecting her, making sure the college was unimpeachable.
But there's little chance that Asriel's heresy will not get back to the Magisterium.
You're saying, we have to let her go?
The alethiometer says that Lyra has to make a journey.
What kind of journey?
One which, I'm afraid, includes a great betrayal.
Well, who's going to betray her? Asriel?
That's the saddest thing... she will be the betrayer.
And the experience will be terrible.
We can keep her here.
We must!
I know you care for her, and you've truly taught her as well as you could, Charles, but all we can be is scared for her. And scared of her.
Come on, hurry up.
Great, you're here! I'm starving.
I brought you an extra sausage.
You mean you got an extra for yourself.
This may be true.
( Lyra laughs )
I missed dinner last night.
I noticed. Where were you?
In a cupboard.
The whole night?
Most of it.
It's... complicated.
Have you ever heard about Dust?
Dust?
I'm guessing you don't mean the stuff we polish off?
Unh-unh.
Where should I start?
Are you all right, Lyra?
Just thinking aloud.
Well, there's two things you need to know.
A Gyptian boy, Billy Costa, is missing.
Billy Costa?
I remember him... Tony's brother? Some people are saying there's a man with bright eyes, others say it's a singing man with a fox daemon.
It's got to be the Gobblers.
The Gobblers?
I've told you, the Gobblers are a myth, Roger, they don't exist!
The Gyptians will find Billy.
Fine.
But don't blame me when I get to say I told you so.
Second thing... your uncle's packing up an airship to leave.
Not without me he isn't!
Lyra!
Uncle!
Uncle!
What?! What are you doing here? I'm busy!
You're not leaving!
I can't stay!
The Magisterium will be on to me by now.
Besides, I got what I came for.
Be a good girl, try and learn something, and I'll see you on the way back.
Please, uncle, you've only just arrived, we've hardly talked!
We need to go.
Please, uncle!
Lines up!
I am sorry, but I just don't have time for you right now.
I...
Let's go.
Take me North! You promised you would!
Take me with you, we'd have lots of time then!
The North is no place for a child.
Did it look like this?
What?
The airship that my parents died in?
No. No, it was smaller.
She's better than you think she is.
She's special.
Everyone's special!
So, where?
We've searched here and here. Nothing.
We covered all the abandoned wood. There was nothing...
Lord Faa.
Where is Ma Costa?
We told her to wait on her boat in case Billy returns there.
And the rest of our people?
State Police have shown no interest.
Hmph. No surprises there.
So we're organising teams of our own.
We've got a group that went North from Magdalen Bridge up the Cherwell.
Nothing. We divided Jericho, we staked out the Airship Station.
John, the Gobblers will have got him out of Oxford by now.
You think it's the Gobblers?
The Gobblers haven't took my brother.
That's just a children's story. No. The Gobblers are real.
John Faa and I have visited six different Gyptian communities, all having children taken, all the same way.
Yeah, but why? What can they want with them?
That we don't know.
We don't know what they do, but we will find out.
We have word they are taking the children to London.
Maybe it's the best way to hide them?
But we must go and try!
Wait, leave here?
No, no, Ma would never agree to that!
Billy's lost, he's not been taken.
Continue the search.
Cover as much of this area as we can today.
And if we do not find him here, we'll go to London and find him there.
Where are you, Billy?
Well, if he won't take us, I'll find another way to go North.
You are aware that I work here right?
And you're pretty much stuck here because we're orphans and both of us have no money.
Sometimes you've got to have dreams.
We're going North, Roger.
I just know we are.
If you say so.
He worked them up into a fervour, they were almost riotous by the time he finished.
We're sure this information is correct?
I had good people inside the room.
So Asriel claims he can see Dust now?
It's not what he can see, it's what he claims to see through it.
A hidden city.
Other worlds.
The Master of Jordan College risks him saying as much? Scholastic Sanctuary.
The Master cannot be so naive as to imagine that Scholastic Sanctuary protects him from the accusation of heresy. Asriel clearly got the better of him.
They've given him an enormous amount of money... to travel North and continue with his work.
Discover all you can and by all means permitted.
This kind of heresy is of the highest priority to the Magisterium.
I shall take it to the Cardinal.
Yes, Father.
I need to know where he's going and what exactly... he intends to achieve.
I will do all that I can.
Oh, Boreal.
Yes, Father?
Not a word to any of our mutual friends.
That includes her.
          ALL Benedic, Domine.
Nos et dona tua.
Quae de largitate.
Tua sumus sumpturi.
Et concede, ut illis salubriter.
Nutriti tibi obsequium praestare valeamus.
          ALL Per Christum Dominum nostrum.
Amen.
          ALL Amen.
Good evening, Mrs. Coulter.
Good evening, Master.
Lyra, this is Mrs. Coulter, she may be of some interest to you.
Oh. Hello.
I'm not used to the grandeur of this at all.
You'll have to tell me which knife and fork to use. Oh. I don't want to make a fool of myself.
Are you a female scholar?
You seem surprised.
Well, female scholars don't dress like you.
I'll take that as a compliment.
No, I'm not really a scholar, I'm a member of St. Sophia's College.
Most of my work takes place outside Oxford.
Hi, Lyra.
But I'm not interesting.
You are.
Tell me about yourself, Lyra.
Oh, well, nothing to say, really!
So, reports you use the rooftops as your private thoroughfare are completely false, are they?
How do you know about that?
You are quite something, aren't you?
I'm surprised Asriel doesn't talk about you more.
You know my uncle?
Oh, yeah, we occasionally bump into each other at the Arctic Institute.
You're an explorer too?!
Oh, that's such a grand word.
But, yes, I suppose I am.
Have you... ? Have you ever seen an armoured bear? Or Tartars?!
Well, I've negotiated with bears.
It's much more tiresome than it sounds.
I've fought Tartars and that can actually be quite fun.
But does this really interest you?
I am capable of being quite boring sometimes.
No, no, no, no. Where the North is concerned, you could never bore me.
Well, my favourite moment is early morning, when the sky is high and the land seems endless.
All that's in front of you is fresh unbroken snow.
You feel utterly alone... and you feel utterly magnificent.
I want to feel like that.
Take a seat, Lyra.
Lyra, do you know why I'm here?
The Master has asked if I can find a place for you and, naturally, I wanted to meet you first.
And now that I've met you, I like you, and I want to offer you a position as my assistant.
Now, you'll need to learn fast and I won't take any slacking.
But I think with your enthusiasm and my know-how we could make quite the team.
We'd go to the North?
Well, we'll go to London first.
And you'd have to be prepared to leave tomorrow.
I have an airship booked for the both of us.
My friend Roger... can he come too?
He's not much of an explorer, but he can cook and clean and...
The boy in the dining hall?
But I have all the household staff that I need, Lyra...
He won't let you down. I need him.
He's my best friend, my only friend. Please. He's an orphan like me and leaving Jordan College would be the most exciting thing for us.
Fine. He can come.
Lyra, stop and think before you tell him.
There is a chance he may not want to go.
Jordan College is all he knows.
It's all I know too!
But we were always going to leave Jordan College, Pan.
Roger isn't like you.
We'll explain it to him tomorrow.
Even he'll know he can't miss this chance.
We can't. Ma!
( She sobs ) My Billy...
My Billy.
Ma, it's all right.
It's all right.
( Bell chimes )
( Knocking on door ) Is it safe to... ? May I... ?
Librarian?
Who were you expecting at this hour?
Roger with my breakfast.
What... ? What are you doing here?
You're needed.
Rather urgently, as it happens.
Well, quickly, Lyra, get dressed.
Ah, good girl, come quickly.
We haven't long.
I'm leaving Jordan to live with Mrs. Coulter and Roger and no-one...
And no-one is stopping you.
You know about that?
Mrs. Coulter has spoken to me, yes.
I arranged it all myself.
The part of your life that belongs to Jordan College is coming to an end. Now, please sit.
So, why am I here then? Lyra, I promised once to do everything I could to protect you from anyone who might do you harm.
Protect me?
From what?
And the older you've got, the more I've felt the importance of that promise.
Who did you promise?
I think Mrs. Coulter will do her best by you, but I can't be sure.
So I'm going to give you something.
And I need you to promise that you will keep it private.
This matters, Lyra.
We need your word.
What is it?
It's an alethiometer.
One of only six that were ever made.
It's beautiful.
Lord Asriel himself brought it to this college, when you were just a baby.
It's extraordinary.
What does it do?
It tells you the truth.
How?
That, Pan and you will have to learn by yourselves.
But please know that it is illegal unless approved by the Magisterium.
So secrecy is...
No, no, no, I don't want secrets.
It's my uncle's. He wouldn't want me to have it anyway.
Lyra, look at me!
The powers of this world are very strong.
Men and women are moved by tides much fiercer than you can imagine.
This hopefully will provide you with some protection.
Go well, Lyra.
Goodbye, Lyra.
And... keep your own counsel.
Not a word to anyone, not even Mrs. Coulter.
We need to tell Roger we're going to London.
I'm looking for Roger.
So am I! He didn't turn up for the breakfast shift!
Roger?
Mrs Woodbridge, have you seen Roger?
No, I haven't.
Any of you?
Mr. Cousins, have you seen Roger? No.
Roger?
Eric, have you seen Roger? No.
Roger!
This is the last place he'd be!
There's nowhere else to look!
Roger!
Are you down here?
You don't think the Gobblers have got him, do you?
Readying the boats?
Are you thinking of leaving, Farder Coram? My son's still out there.
Farder Coram has done nothing.
I am halting the search.
You may be the Western King, but my son is worth more than...
The children call them Gobblers.
There's nothing saying he's with them.
There's nothing saying they even exist.
Billy's a good boy.
He's strong because you have been a good and strong mother to him, Maggie.
And if he could, he'd have found his way back to us.
But he has not.
He's just... lost his way and he needs us to find him.
They've taken 16 of our children so far and that number keeps growing.
Searching for him here, when we know he is lost, is foolishness and you know it!
We're going to London, we will fight those Gobblers and get our children back.
Come on.
Good, you're early. I like early.
My friend Roger, he's gone missing, I can't find him anywhere.
This isn't like him. Something's happened.
What do you mean? You seem worried, Lyra. Tell me.
I know the Gobblers...
Shh.
... are just children's stories but... Not here, Lyra.
But one of the Gyptian children, Billy Costa, he's gone missing, they say it's the Gobblers, so...
With every child's nightmare there's an element of truth, Lyra.
You're saying the Gobblers could be real?
They could have Roger?
He was right?
It is possible.
Then we should call the State Police...
No, no, no, no.
They'll be of no use at all.
The State Police wouldn't care about a kitchen boy, he'll be miles away by now.
Lyra, listen to me.
Do you care for this boy?
Yes.
Does he care for you?
Yes.
Right.
Then we'll need to take the matter into our own hands.
The Gobblers will have taken him to London.
I'll set down tracks as soon as we arrive.
The Gobblers are in London?
Yeah, of course they're in London.
Oxford's too small.
In London, children can just... disappear.
In Oxford, there's nowhere to hide.
In London, there's everywhere.
And you'll help find him?
Lyra, look at me.
I won't just help, I won't just try, I'll succeed.
Your luggage, Ma'am.
Right, I'm on the eight o'clock airship.
I expect to see you there.
For your sake and for Roger's.
Lyra, the gift the Master gave you.
What did he say this did?
Tell the truth.
Tell me where Roger is.
Come on.
Tell me where I can find Roger.
The airship is about to leave.
If we're going, we have to go now.
Tell me if the Gobblers have Roger.
If the Gobblers have him... she's our... best chance of getting him back.
Isn't she?
Wait!
Lyra, I am so glad you decided to join me.
Here, come, take a seat.
I think it's the best decision for both of us.
So, where do we start looking for Rog?
Lyra, airships aren't safe spaces to talk, shh.
But we need to start thinking about where to...
We're together now.
We'll have plenty of time to discuss whatever you wish.
A bit of quiet now would be best.
The Gyptians.
They're leaving too?
Let me out!
Lyra, this is your new home.
Home for us all.
Roger's too.
When she finds him.
27 Gyptian children have been taken.
And now is the time for action.
We will get our children back.
Is it true that you're funding Asriel's investigations?
What do you know about Dust, Lyra?
It doesn't affect children.
And who did you learn this from?
Recent Gyptian raiders causing trouble again.
We're going to find out what they're doing to the children.
This kind of heresy is of highest priority to the Magisterium.
How are you able to be so far away from your daemon?
How am I supposed to trust you when no-one tells me the truth?!
Some things you're better off not knowing.
The children, they are taken some distance inland.
We have to fight.
We have to kill.
The Magisterium are everywhere.
( Whispering ): Lyra, don't breathe.
We all want to find the missing children so will you stay with us?
I've been busy.
Where?
Oxford.
What do all of these symbols mean?
It takes years of study.
It's trying to warn me of something.
I suspect it's trying to warn you of everything.
We go North. Now!
I represent the Western Gyptians and we would like to hire you.
I know what you're fighting, kid.
You're going to lose.
I would obtain the services of an armoured bear.
Tell me where she is.
With Iorek on our side, we stand a chance.
Has anyone seen a bear?
Who is Lyra Belacqua?
What's he trying to do with Dust?
Flood us all with sin?
This is war.
The fate of more than this world depends on her.
And who are you, exactly?
It's time.
I know.

Mrs Coulter, she's a Gobbler.
The head of the Gobblers.
Tell me where she is... or I will destroy all of this.
I left Lyra with you.
I trusted you to look after her.
We know you, Lyra.
You have always been important to us.
Is this because of my father, because he's Lord Asriel?
Who told you that?
He's a failure of a man and a failure of a father!
It was... all... a lie.
She's your mother, Lyra!
That's what no-one is telling you.
It's an alethiometer.
It tells you the truth.
It worked.
An hourglass with a skull on top of it.
( Gun fires )
She can read the alethiometer... without the books. Farder Coram!
But if she can continue to do it, she will be more valuable to us than any soldier we have.
Fighting back... is the only way.
Ready yourselves to travel North.
Ready yourselves to bring our children home.
Gyptians!
          ALL Gyptians!
A spy fly.
We've found her.

♪ Running around with a child's mind ♪ Woo! ♪ A man gets lucky just a couple of times ♪ Sing it, Hester.
( They hum ) Hm. You're excited!
Damn right I am.
Finally got a lead on Iorek.
He might not be the same bear, the Iorek I knew...
Some crazy seal hunter got him drunk, tricked him out of his armour.
An armoured bear is nothing without his armour.
Hester!
I'm right here.
What do you see?
Looks like we're not the only ones heading to Trollesund.
Lee, are you sure Iorek will want us making trouble?
That bear saved our lives, Hester. We owe him trouble.

This is an oil port. There's no smoking on the quay.
Then I nearly made a horrible mistake.
Lee Scoresby, aeronaut for hire.
Tell me, who are all these people here?
My question exactly.
New arrivals arouse suspicion.
I did hear a rumour that interested me.
Rumour of a bear.
Any truth to that?
Yes, I heard a rumour, too, of an aeronaut who creates bedlam wherever he goes.
Any truth to that?
Here we go again.
Friendly place.
Yeah.
No, it's not.
Can we just stay out of trouble?
Gyptians.
Never seen them so far North.
The spy fly will have reached Mrs Coulter by now.
Our business here must be in haste.
I don't like it here either.
Go see the witches' consul, get whatever help you can, and we leave here as fast as possible.
It's been 40 years since I saw Serafina last.
She might not like what she sees.
I remember you as a younger man, Coram.
You weren't much to look at even then.
( They chuckle ) You're sure you should take the girl?
Something tells me I'll need her.
          PAN Quite something, all this. My whole life I've wanted to be here, and now that I'm here, I'm not so sure I want to be.
Lyra.
Lyra.
A word, please.
I need to know if I can trust in your readings of the alethiometer.
How do you decipher it?
I kind of feel them or see them.
It's like... like going down a ladder at night.
( Shouting ) You put your foot down, and there's another rung.
Well, I put my mind down, and there's another meaning.
I sort of... sense what they mean.
It's got a trick in it.
Sort of like focusing your eyes. Ah. So say you wanted to ask the alethiometer what your parents are doing now?
Well, the Madonna is Mrs Coulter.
Oh. The Madonna, is it?
And for Asriel, it would be the globe.
So I think of my parents when I put my hand there.
And... then I go for the ant because that means busy.
But how do you know what these meanings are? Hm? The Magisterium.
Put it away, Lyra.
You understand, the man we're going to see is important.
Yes.
The Witch Consul is a link between the human world and the witches.
He will decide whether to pass our message on.
And we need the witches. Yes, but he'll want to know everything.
The Consul is the only way to contact the witches, and he must trust us first, but if he does, a witch called Serafina Pekkala will surely come to our aid.
With her help, we will find the children.
You mean she'll lead us to Roger?
Yes.
Just follow my lead.
Keep that thing hidden, okay?
( Knocking on door ) How can I help you, Farder Coram?
I met a witch some years ago in the Fen country of Eastern Anglia.
Her name was Serafina Pekkala.
I wish to get a message to her.
I'm aware of your relationship with Serafina Pekkala, Farder Coram.
I represent a number of Gyptian families who have lost children. We believe there is an organisation that is capturing these children, ours and others, and taking them North.
We need her help to get them free. Well...
You realise that relations between the witches and the authorities are... perfectly cordial.
It is my job to keep them that way.
You refer... to the Magisterium.
This fight is not ours.
They are stealing children.
This is war for all of us.
And I know Serafina will want to be part of it.
The children do not remain here for long.
They are taken some distance inland.
Do you know what happens to them there?
I've heard variously of the Maystadt process, or an... intercision.
The process is shrouded in secrecy, but the rumours are disturbing.
There's a reason why you don't see a child on the streets of Trollesund.
We, too, have felt the effects of missing children.
Then I will leave you... to let Serafina know what we ask of her.
Come.
I understand you are in possession of an alethiometer.
I have eyes everywhere in Trollesund.
Yes.
May I look at it?
It's exquisite.
Do you possess the books of readings?
Actually... I can read it.
You are very wise to say so.
How?
I just can.
Well... I wonder if I might ask to see you do so.
Down here, there are many sprigs of cloud-pine.
Which one belongs to Serafina Pekkala?
I can summon the witches through cloud-pine.
Each spray of cloud-pine is specific to a witch.
( Alethiometer clicks )
Show us which one is Serafina Pekkala's.
Chameleon... and the Moon.
This one's hers.
I'd like to give you something to take away with you.
Carry this spray with you, and if you ever truly need her... she will come.
Dr Lanselius, may I ask you something?
Of course.
What question should we be asking you that we are not?
You're weak.
You may have heart, but the Magisterium have muscle.
I would ask where I could obtain the services of an armoured bear.
I understood the armoured bears answered to nobody.
There is at least one who does.
An exile.
He shamed his people, but be warned... his skill with metal makes him useful to the town.
They don't like strangers knowing about him or interfering in his affairs.
You'll find him beside Einarsson's Bar.
But to get him away... will take some doing.
His name... is Iorek Byrnison.
Iorek Byrnison!
( Growling )
( Growling ) Iorek Byrnison, can we talk with you?
We wish to offer you employment.
          DEEP VOICE I am employed.
We need fighters, or... in all probability, we will.
We're going North till we find the place where children are being kept captive.
When we find them, there will surely be a battle.
( Growling ) What do you do... in the metalworks?
I mend the broken machinery.
I lift heavy objects.
And what kind of work is that for a panserbjorn?
( Iorek roars )
If you'll excuse me saying, Iorek Byrnison... you could be living free and proud on the ice, hunting seal and walrus, or going to war, winning great prizes.
( He growls )
I know the people you are seeking.
The child cutters.
People of this town, they pretend not to see, but I see.
And are you a coward like they are?
( He growls ) A coward?
( He growls )
( Low growl )
We need you.
I am not for sale.
It's quiet today.
Big hearing in the Consistorial Court.
Oh, is that right?
And I thought it was because everyone knew that I was coming.
We didn't announce it.
No, I know.
Trying to be funny.
My apologies.
( She laughs ) They do like to look at me, though, as I pass.
Well... you've acquired a reputation.
A reputation for stirring up trouble.
Now, quickly.
The cardinal will not be kept waiting.
I thought I was perfectly clear.
You were.
Try to keep your head down. Show some restraint.
No, you express it all most eloquently.
Yet not a few days later, you invaded a college protected by scholastic sanctuary and undermining a centuries-old relationship. Yes.
It was very unfortunate.
( Door opens ) It's good to see you again, Marisa.
It has been some time.
Not so long.
Can I get anything for you?
I know how much you like your sustenances.
Food, tea, water?
I arrived fed and watered.
Just skip to the part where you reveal what punishment you intend for me, hm?
Punishment?
Such a strange word.
I don't intend to punish you.
( She laughs ) I'm sure that's not true.
I fear our project has become too noisy.
I am passing leadership of the Oblation Board onto Father MacPhail, and, as of now, you are stripped of all official duties.
Hm.
Hm?
( She claps ) Beautifully done. Hm. Now, should I tell you why you won't, and why I go North tomorrow?
I have Lord Asriel.
You have Asriel?
In a jail... controlled by bears, who are, in this case... controlled by me.
I will travel to the North, and I will give him to you as an act of service, and, in return, you'd allow me to pursue our project until its end. And you would allow me to ask one question of Fra Pavel... and his alethiometer.
That seems like a high price.
For Asriel, it's cheap.
Now, shall we sit... and discuss how to proceed?
Please.
Lyra, the way you spoke to that bear, he could have torn your throat out.
And you could've imprisoned me, and sold me back to Mrs Coulter.
I know who to trust, Farder Coram.
But if you're wrong, you could do yourself damage.
I'd do myself... more damage not trusting anyone.
What happened between you and Serafina?
We loved each other.
You loved a witch?
We had a child.
A son.
There was an epidemic.
There was nothing we could do. He died.
And she wanted to rip the world apart... fly to Yambe-Akka, fight her... if that's what it took to get him back. I wanted to mourn... in peace.
Haven't seen her since...
( Shakily ): ... after we buried my boy.
So sorry, Farder Coram. It was a long time ago.
Say what you like about the North, wherever you go is guaranteed to be a bar full of men who should be at home but aren't. Any gentlemen in the mood for a game of Hazard? No?
How about a game of Flippity Flop?
It's real simple.
There are three pots.
A flip pot, lot pot, a game pot.
As long as you can stake a pot, you can play.
Will you join me in a glass of hot rum?
My round.
I'm just looking for some conversation, you see.
What are you all afraid of?
That I'll learn your secrets?
That I'm... grubbing for shady business? I'm not.
I am simply after a bear.
It's kind of royal looking, fancy armour.
I know. Strange for these parts.
You know what a bear looks like, don't you?
Thick coat, big teeth, cute little nose.
Right.
Well, at this point, you're either being ignorant or wilfully obstructive.
( Man yells )
What are you thinking?!
Come here!
( Man laughs ) You started the fight, now you're losing the fight!
I know what you're going to say.
( He yells out ) Come on, up!
Lee, your turn! Do something!
( He grunts )
Okay, you got to kick.
That's right, kick again!
Bottle!
( Shouting ) That was nice.
Love it. More of that.
No! Hey! You almost got me.
( Grunting )
( Yelling )
Nice kick!
All right, we're having fun now.
Come on!
( Grunting ) Hey, Lee!
You got this!
What are you doing, going high?
You can't go high. They're going to get you!
Whoa!
Hold him!
Argh!
Throw him out!
Quit asking about bears, aeronaut.
Well, that showed them.
I'd like to think I made my point.
And what point was that?
Three watches and a wallet.
I've wanted to visit this room for quite some time.
He's normally very careful of who he allows up.
You understand anything you ask me may take weeks of study.
I want a guarantee that, whatever you find out, I'll be the first to know.
What is your question?
It's a simple one.
Who is Lyra Belacqua?
Surely you of all...
Just ask the question, Fra Pavel.
Has anyone seen a bear?!
What do you want with a bear?
You're bleeding.
Hazard of the job.
And what job do you do?
I'm in aeronautics.
What part of being an aeronaut...?
Let me give you a tip, kid.
Never upset a seagull.
You're not serious.
Not if I can help it.
Will he want to see you, this bear?
I hope so.
You know where he is, don't you?
The town's no place for Iorek.
How do you know him?
Well, she's just a sprung box, isn't she?
She just keeps asking questions.
Lee Scoresby.
Can you tell me where to find him?
I'm just following her lead.
What is it about him?
What's keeping him trapped?
Kid, I'll tell you that when you tell me what you know.
Another time.
Why won't you tell me?
Because we need him, and I'm not sure that you won't take him from us.
Serafina once told me of a prophecy about a child.
I think it could be Lyra.
People see something in her.
You should have seen Dr Lanselius.
The look on his face when she answered his questions.
He looked...
How?
Greedy.
Greedy?
There are things going on, John, that we do not understand.
The further North we go, the more we must watch her.
( Squawking )
Ah.
A spy.
No. The Witch Consul must have passed on our message.
Serafina's daemon.
So it's true.
The witches do have the power to send their daemons from them.
I have... changed much... since last you saw me, Kaisa.
You have, Coram van Texel.
May I... introduce John Faa, king of the western Gyptians?
This is Kaisa, daemon of Serafina Pekkala, queen of the Lake Enara clan.
Serafina sends you happiness.
How far away is she...?
And she asks if you have come to make war.
If it takes war... to get our children back, then... we are ready to wage it.
I'd hope the witches would help.
Not all will.
Some clans are working with the Oblation Board.
Those who search for Dust.
And where are they now, these Dust hunters?
Four days Northeast of here. They call it The Station.
The witches call it Bolvangar.
Bolvangar? Translated, that means... "fields of evil." Can you take us there?
Serafina Pekkala will support you in whatever route your path takes.
What do you think it is, Pan... makes it look like that?
I don't know, but it's... it's amazing.
Do you think that's what Dust looks like?
There's something in it.
Not quite...
It looks like a city.
It's gone.
Maybe it's the alethiometer, telling us where to go, where Roger is.
Maybe.
Do you think he's cold?
I hope not.
I'm the same.
I find myself thinking about Billy at the strangest times.
Even found myself thinking about him on the toilet this morning.
Heard you met a bear.
Yeah.
Fun?
Scary?
Confusing.
Definitely not what I expected.
We're going to get them back, Tony.
I know.
We will do whatever it takes to get them back.
Hey, Lee, can we take a break?
We've been searching for hours. I don't think he's he...
Iorek Byrnison!
Uh...
It's been some time.
What are you doing here?
It hasn't been some time.
It's been three years.
( He growls )
Three years, long as all that?
It has not been a good three years.
We want to help, Iorek. Can we help?
I owe you. We both know it.
And how can you help me?
Some look good naked. You do not.
Who has it?
Your armour?
I am drunk, Lee!
And not behaving as a bear should, and I'd rather you leave me.
And what if I don't want to go?!
You know, when I see an old friend, I'm inclined to tell him where I've been, adventures I've had.
I have done things I can't talk about.
I've done some things I'm not too keen on people knowing either.
Tell me what you've done.
We wouldn't judge you, couldn't judge you.
And what if I deserve to be judged?
Don't let him go.
We came here just for you, Iorek!
Then you should leave, Lee, for I neither asked you to come, nor do I want you to stay.
It's not often we get customers waiting for us.
You haven't got that lucky, Mr Sysselman.
I'm not handing myself in.
Oh, is that right? Heh!
Huh!
How can I help?
I'm representing the bear.
The bear's case is closed.
Correction, I am representing myself via the bear.
The trouble is, you confiscated my property instead of his.
Yes, I doubt that, Mr Scoresby.
This is why I've been seeking him.
Now, this is a bill of sale... stating that I, not Iorek Byrnison, own his armour.
He lost it to me in a game of cards, you see.
I've come back to reclaim it.
The bear's armour belongs to the Magisterium.
Ah, yes. He is paying off a blood debt.
Ha, well, yes, this document is correct as far as the Crime and Debt Act, chapter three, paragraph 4.5 is concerned.
The trouble is the Crime and Debt Act is superseded in this circumstance by the Possession of Goods Act, part three, subsection four, "miscellaneous provisions", which clearly states, and I quote, "the possession of valuables belongs to..." Please...
Do not doubt my intelligence, Mr...
It's not your intelligence I doubt, Mr Sysselman.
Who paid you to write this and how much will it cost me for you to rewrite it?
Now, you be careful what you accuse me of.
Not even money'll work.
They've got you well controlled, haven't they? Whatever you're accusing me of...
Now, the North, as I understand it, has always been a place for people who didn't fit in or didn't want to.
The Magisterium has been trying to gain power out here for a generation.
No-one ever actually let them in.
Until, perhaps, now.
( Metal scraping wood )
Be very careful.
He's a bear.
He can't be a slave.
Not to you, the Magisterium or anyone.
Shame on you, Mr Sysselman.
"I believe I have been helpful in the disposal of Iorek Byrnison and and helping you take your rightful throne." I'm perfectly prepared.
"My Northern king..." We're leaving?
Yes.
The witches have agreed to help us.
But... But we haven't got Iorek.
The Witch Consul said we need Iorek.
He also warned there was little chance of getting him away.
You don't know what awaits us out there.
With Iorek on our side, we stand a chance. Lyra, we've just had a good word that your father has been taken prisoner and is guarded by armoured bears.
The Magisterium are everywhere.
We can't dare wait.
They have Asriel?
They do.
Then all the more reason to have an armoured bear on our side!
We don't want him.
We made inquiries.
Iorek is being punished for fighting and wrecking this town.
He was drunk.
That's the only reason they managed to prize his armour from him.
He is a savage.
Lyra, that is not necessary!
Let her do it.
( Alethiometer clicks )
The alethiometer says that they got him drunk and tricked him.
No bear would normally drink spirits.
He tore through the police house and the bank.
The only reason they didn't shoot him was because of his skills with metal.
Why don't you check your alethiometer to see whether I'm telling the truth now?
You don't need to, because you know it.
I choose who I fight alongside, and that is my final word.
I heard you had a visitor.
What did Mrs Coulter want with you?
You think I can tell you that?
It's more than my position is worth.
Come now, Ratty.
You mistake me for someone who cares about your position.
Remember...
I know what kind of man you are.
Your filthy predilections.
And the trouble they have caused.
You shouldn't do this to me. Hm. I need an answer... from the alethiometer.
I wish to know... what Grumman discovered.
That is a dissident.
That is heretical.
It's my job to understand heretics, is it not?
You ask the cardinal for his permission before demanding...
I'm not asking the cardinal.
I'm asking you, Ratty.
How can I get what Grumman discovered?
You have neither his permission nor Father McPhail's.
I don't need his permission!
I just need your consent.
Will you deny it?
Or must I... expose you... to the world?
Because I will... out of spite... if I don't get my own way.
I already thought it.
The question I want to ask.
How can I find what Grumman discovered?
( He grunts )
( Distant conversation ) Good.
Send me word as soon as you have something.
You know what, Lyra?
There is one person in this town who knows that bear.
Pan, you're a genius!
Hey, can you remind me why we're here again?
It's the only place in town with a bed and a halfway decent plate of scran.
It worries me that bacon is more important to you than survival.
And by the way, you are aware everyone is looking at us?
It's time to leave.
Yeah, we're not leaving without Iorek.
Thank you.
They know you stole from them, Lee.
Every minute we spend here longer than we should...
Bear saved my life, Hester.
And we came here to repay him, and he told us he didn't need our help.
Who didn't need your help?
You know, kid, much as I like you, now is not the time.
I represent John Faa, ruler of the western Gyptians, and we would like to hire you.
You can't afford me.
Mr Scoresby, the Magisterium is stealing children.
We have to get them back, and it occurred to us that the help of an aeronaut might be of some use.
We'd be grateful for your services.
We pay in gold.
I know what you're fighting, kid.
You're going to lose.
You play cards?
Ha! What do you know about cards?
I used to play them with the scholars where I lived.
They are much cleverer than me, but I generally won.
I learned that sometimes a bad hand can be your greatest weapon.
Sometimes, when there is no hope, it can allow you to bluff magnificently.
Remind me never to play cards with you.
We need you... and the bear.
You need the bear and I'm secondary.
How do we get him to come with us?
I know you know.
He's obliged to this town.
Iorek's going nowhere.
He's an armoured bear.
What could they...?
They got his armour.
Hey, you got there without needing my help.
Why's his armour so important?
War is the sea he swims in and the air he breathes. No. Without his armour... his armour means as much to him as Hester here does to me.
His armour's like his daemon?
His soul is in those pieces of metal.
But the Magisterium will have it well hidden.
Now, I've been thinking that maybe I'm outgunned in this town, but I've got some craft of my own, you understand. No, if I can't win Iorek's freedom, then...
Where did she go?
She's quick, and she stole my bacon.
Lyra, assuming this works, which is a long shot, you've still got to convince Lord Faa.
Just leave that to me.
Lyra, this way.
Through here.
( Metal screeching )
( Metal thumping )
( Bear growls )
( Low growling )
( Clattering )
( He growls )
I know where your armour is, Iorek Byrnison.
Or at least I know how to find it.
How could you know where it is?
I... don't understand.
Why don't you just make some more armour out of this metal here?
It's worthless!
My armour is made of sky-iron, and it was made for me... by me.
I have spent months looking for it.
( He growls ) How have you found it?
This.
It tells me the truth, and I'll use it if you come with us.
I will come with you, but I have a right to take vengeance.
If they try to stop me taking my armour... they die.
That seems fair.
But only if they try and hurt you.
Good.
Where is my armour?
( Clicking ) It's hidden.
Magisterium have it hidden.
It's in the cellar of the oratory.
( He roars ) This is not good!
( Thumping and clattering )
He's going to tear everything apart!
( Iorek roars )
We've got to stop him!
( Growling ) Iorek! Stop! ( Roaring )
No!
Iorek!
( He roars ferociously )
( Distant roaring )
Clear the square!
Move!
All right, then, boys.
( Shouting )
( Roaring )
( Screaming )
( Iorek growls ) Level them!
Fire!
( Iorek growls ) Reload!
( He roars ) Reload, immediately!
( He screams ) Stop!
Stop!
Let go of him!
I told you. If they fight... they die!
You owe me a debt.
Now you can repay it.
Do as I ask, don't fight these men!
You owe her a debt, too?
Damn, Iorek, you're racking up debts faster than me.
Heard there was some action occurring.
I thought I'd come see what's going on.
Hello again, Mr Sysselman.
Having fun? I hope so.
( He groans )
Just turn around.
Walk away with me.
Please.
She's just a kid, but she talks some sense.
These people need our help, Iorek. Let's go give it.
This isn't who you are.
( He roars )
( He sighs ) We're packed up.
We're really going.
Lyra, trust me when I tell you, it's within us to beat these people.
Course it is, but would you mind if I brought along a little extra help all the same? How did you...?!
He's been mistreated and tricked, just like the Gyptians have been, always mistreated and tricked.
He's practically Gyptian.
Just like I am.
Lyra.
You cannot constantly be disobeying me.
I agree. Who wants a disobedient kid?
But she's right.
He's a good bear. You won't have any trouble as long as you pay him.
And me.
And who's this?
You told me he'd asked for me.
No, I told you he'd be grateful for you.
Yeah, I was working on him already being grateful.
You've entirely messed up my sales pitch.
What did I tell you about how I play cards?
Lee Scoresby.
I can fight and I can fly.
I don't come cheap and neither should I.
You'll get gold for gold.
And you are going to need all the help you can get.
He's an aeronaut.
He has his own balloon.
He can be useful.
Well, then, welcome aboard, Lee Scoresby.
We have a long and dangerous journey ahead.
Iofur?
( Clattering ) Iofur? Iofur. I appreciate the need to keep our meeting a secret, but it will be difficult if I can't see you.
Don't waste my time!
No, no, of course.
You... You are right.
You are a king, and I am impertinent.
I am king, and you are not a queen.
And we are very grateful for your... help in capturing Asriel.
Many have tried, and only you have succeeded.
And yet, I... Yet you doubt me.
King Raknison, I was a great help in aiding you in the disposal of Iorek Byrnison and helping you take your throne. And I agreed to capture Asriel to repay my debt.
But he is now my prisoner in my dungeon, and I will do with him as I choose.
Well, perhaps, then... as an envoy from my people... I could offer you something that might be of worth to you. And in return, you may... permit me to oversee how you deal with... Asriel.
I am a king!
I have all I need.
I'm talking... of a baptism.
( Growling ) Acceptance into the Magisterium. Baptism. King Iofur... you are a great bear... and the Magisterium would be stronger for having you part of it.
Part of us.
Will you walk the path with us?
No bears have ever been brought into the Magisterium before.
You would be the first bear to be baptised... and the only.
But do not mistake me, the honour would be ours.
In return for which... I will give them Asriel?
No, you will keep him here, but you will ensure his laboratory is destroyed and that his research into Dust is erased.
But I will control him.
I'm simply asking for you to show your loyalty to us so that we may show our loyalty to you.

In the meantime, I'm sure you have much to attend to.
How soon can this happen?
( She laughs ) The wheels have already started turning.
Asriel will be controlled.

You've failed. I'm here for Asriel.
I need to come with you.
Lord Asriel needs to die.
Iorek, the alethiometer, my father will need it.
We'll need the truth to defeat her. I need to give it to him.
We're investigating the disappearance of some rather valuable objects. Dangerous objects.
And your husband's name keeps getting brought up.
I have nothing for you.
That's not true.
I need an answer on the alethiometer.
What did Grumman discover?
There. Can you see?
That's where my father is?
Your dad, I think he was involved in something dangerous.
Dangerous?
I don't care how you do it... I want the letters.
You have to leave, you have to turn around and leave.
I did not send for you.
( Growling ) Asriel.
Roger Parslow, I am very pleased you came.
The alethiometer says that Lyra has to make a journey.
One which I'm afraid includes a great betrayal.
FATHER MACPHAIL ( OVER TANNOY )
For each and every one of you... going out to fight this abominable foe.... in the face of an attack on everything we hold sacred... I implore you to channel the Authority in this time of need. ( Stelmaria growls )
          STELMARIA The aurora is strong now.
And the child's here.
( He breathes heavily )
          STELMARIA It's time.
I know.

( Sniffing ) What is all this stuff? ( Faint clicking ) I understand you arrived here on Iorek Byrnison's back.
New king of the bears. I believe you preferred the old one?
But you should be happy now you're free.
How does a little girl acquire the king of the panserbjorne as a guardian?
It's been quite a journey to get here.
That's not an answer.
And I don't remember inviting you.
You don't want me here?
Left you where you were safe, Lyra, at Jordan College.
Whatever you've brought me... I hope it was worth it.
Now, what is it?
I'll tell you... if you tell me why you... why you lied to me about being my father.
I would have been so proud.
Why would you have been proud?
Because you're... Lord Asriel.
And you're my father.
Your mother, she...
Do you know who your mother is?
Your choice in women is almost as bad as your choice in bears.
I don't think we should continue this conversation.
Why not?
Because it is getting sentimental.
Sentimental?!
And because I wouldn't like to.
Are you crying? It's unnecessary.
Lyra Belacqua, you are stronger than that.
It's Silvertongue now.
You don't want my name?
Silvertongue feels like my name.
It was given to me by someone who actually loves me, which is better than I can say for you.
This is why I'm here.
I brought you this and I saved Roger and now I'll be on my way.
It's the middle of the night.
I'll leave in the morning, then.
( Alethiometer lid clicks open )
( Alethiometer lid clicks shut ) You can keep the alethiometer.
I don't need it.
You don't want it?
I didn't say that. Hm.
I looked after this. All the way from Jordan College! Fought the Magisterium, enlisted the witches, fought the bears, all to bring it to you, and you refuse it?
Call yourself a father?
I think that's rather the point.
I've never called myself a father.
( Whining )
Have you intruded for a reason?
The winds have changed direction.
( Door closes )
We should pick up speed now.
We'll be there by morning.
The Authority must be on our side.
I wouldn't be so arrogant as to claim that.
Hopefully, we shall prove fast enough.
However fast we go, Asriel will be waiting.
We have firepower and belief.
Two mighty weapons.
All he has is his own distorted arrogance.
And his work.
Work you don't want others to see, but... you really don't want to see it yourself.
You want to see it?
I'm not frightened of it.
What did he do to you?
What power he still exerts!
You know nothing. I knew you.
An ambitious young woman with a good marriage, well on her way to quite some position, and then that man came along and you... melted in front of... I did not melt.
You don't even claim responsibility for your child. Hm.
I suppose you consider yourself without sin.
No-one can claim to be without sin.
So what is your sin, I wonder?
Hm?
Lust?
Greed?
No. It's envy.
You want what Asriel and I have... a sureness of step, a conviction, but you... you lack it.
I'm the best weapon you'll ever have.
Has it given you an answer?
An alethiometer gives you the answer you need, not necessarily the answer you desire.
Sometimes it's more of a riddle than...
What did it say? The question I posed, very precisely, is, "What did Grumman discover?" What did the damn thing say?
It said... there's a knife in a tower surrounded by angels.
That's what he has discovered.
And?
His son will lead you to it.
But Grumman never married, never had a son.
So I may need to ask another question, or...
A son?
You're sure it said a son?
For that part, it gave me the levels of the baby, the angel and the marionette symbols.
The answer was quite categorical.
( Footsteps approach ) Tell me, sir, does she have everything she needs?
Hm?
A brush for her teeth, for instance.
Does she have a toothbrush?
I wouldn't be overly concerned.
Now that Iofur's dead, there will be an airship of soldiers on their way here.
But the Magisterium won't be our only enemies for much longer.
You've found a bigger enemy?
The enemy.
And now that Iofur's guards are gone, I'm free to go after it.
I'm afraid I won't be here when the Magisterium arrives.
I'm going to ask you to make sure that Lyra is safe.
After all this time, you don't want me with you?
It's not that. I need you here.
I'm asking you to protect my daughter.
Will you say goodbye to her?
No. No, I have work.
It's the very least you could do.
( He sighs )
          PAN We don't need Lord Asriel.
We'll leave in the morning at first light.
Lyra. Are you there?
I am.
And you're not coming in.
I'll come in, walk in backwards and sit backwards.
Fine. Tell me if I'm going to hit anything.
You aren't.
You can sit down there.
So what have you got?
What? To say. Why are you in the bathroom? Oh.
I just got spooked.
By what?
By your father. What's he doing here?
He looked at you really angrily, and then he saw me and he calmed down immediately.
He looked at me like he was a wolf or something.
My father...
Can we... call him your father now?
He knows I know.
Didn't go so well?
Not really.
You know what I think?
Parents are more trouble than they're worth.
That's why I never bothered getting to know mine.
Sensible.
You know, I always liked it, that we were the same.
Orphans.
So if you want... we can pretend we are.
( Pan squeaks )
You shouldn't have let him go.
I... didn't know he was useful to us. You wanted the letters.
He is.
He's important.
Tell me what to do.
I don't see why I should get you to do anything.
You mess up.
You ask for help.
I give you Thomas, and you mess up again.
Hang on...
And I have to come myself.
Tell me... is there anything that you can do alone?
Now, think... where this Will might be... what he might be doing.
The kid was a loner. My guess, he's on the streets somewhere.
I'll look into it.
Get rid of the body.
Done. And find the boy.
This is DI Walters to Control. Circulating ops to all units in the Oxford area for last name Parry, first name William.
15-year-old male, around five foot seven. Likely on foot.
Reported missing person.
Any sightings, please come to me direct.
Over.
          RADIO Copy, DI Walters. This is Control.
On the lookout for last name Parry, first name William.
15-year-old male...
( Speech fades )
( Squeaking )
( Lyra and Roger giggle )
          LYRA Stop it!
He wasn't even surprised.
He wasn't even upset. He was just... annoyed at me.
It's probably not what he really thinks.
You sure about that?
You can look at the alethiometer.
Ask it how he really feels.
Does it know everything?
Does it know everything that will happen to us?
I think so, but...
I think it will only tell me what it wants me to know, so...
Then let's not use it.
So we just know what we know, I suppose.
I mean, I'm not like you.
I would never have chosen to leave Jordan.
I know.
But now here we both are, halfway round the world.
And I'm here because of you.
And you're here because of me.
'Cos we changed each other's lives.
I like the fact you changed my life.
Can't promise I won't stop changing it.
          BOTH Cheers.
( Giggling )
( Wind howls ) ( Footsteps approach ) Lyra.
( Pan squeaks )
Shh-shh-shh-shh. Don't be frightened. Come.
          ASRIEL You once asked me what Dust was.
The truth is, I don't know.
Why is the Magisterium so afraid of it?
They're afraid of it because they think it is sin.
Actual physical sin.
Raining down from the sky, settling on humanity and infecting our souls with evil.
To be fair, it's a terrifying thought.
For the longest time, the Magisterium completely ignored Dust.
But then it was discovered that Dust only begins to settle on humans going through puberty.
The connection was made to Adam and Eve... and they labelled Dust as original sin.
Original sin?
When did Eve's daemon settle?
When Eve ate the apple, like the serpent told her to. Well done.
And the serpent said, "You shall not surely die, for the Authority doth know that on that day that ye eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened, your daemons shall assume their true form and ye shall be as..."
          BOTH "... gods, knowing good and..."
LYRA
"... evil."
ASRIEL
"... Dust." You see?
They have been trying to convince us for centuries that we are born guilty.
And that we have to spend a lifetime atoning for the crime of eating an apple.
Is there any proof for this heinous stain, this shame, this guilt? No, not at all.
We are to take it on faith, and on the word of the Authority.
But Dust...
Dust is an elementary particle that we can record, measure, study. We can take photograms of it.
And it has given them what they need... a means by which to control, to oppress, to frighten, and to keep us where they want us... on our knees. That's what my mother thinks she's doing... cutting away our daemons.
Preserving our sinless souls.
You should have seen them.
Those who had their daemons cut away.
They looked empty.
Did they try to cut you, Lyra?
She stopped them.
Your mother stopped them?
She didn't want to damage me.
Happy to damage others.
Is that a fact?
The thought of Pan being cut from me...
( Pan scratches )
( He whimpers quietly )
I know.
The bond between human and daemon is incredibly powerful.
Quite beautiful, really.
There's actually an immense release of energy... when that link is severed.
What is the most important question we can ask?
Where Dust comes from.
There you are.
The photograms you took...
The aurora.
You've seen Dust pouring into this world from the aurora.
If light can cross that barrier between the universes, if Dust can, if we can see that city up there in the sky, then we can build a bridge and we can cross. Cross to multiple worlds?
Why not?
Let's go to the source, let's ask what Dust is.
Maybe we'll find out that it's something else entirely.
Maybe we'll find out that it is sin.
How do you like the sound of that?
I... I don't know.
What I do know is I've done my piece.
Lyra, what I can tell you is that Dust is what makes the alethiometer work.
Did you know that?
I doubt the Magisterium know that.
It works through Dust?
I brought you the alethiometer and now I just need to take Roger home.
Did the Master ever actually ask you to bring it to me?
It's yours.
You were never sent to me at all.
But I am glad you came.
You don't come from nothing, Lyra.
You're the product of something extraordinary.
Goodnight.
( Faint whirring )
( Phone rings )
Anything?
No, nothing. But maybe the police know something.
( Line disconnects ) Fra Pavel said a tower.
It must be the Tower of the Angels.
The legends are true.
But if they are... then this knife...
The boy will lead us to it. ( Faint laughter and chatter )
( Whirring )
( Footsteps approach )
( Clattering ) What... ?
What's going on?
You're awake. Good. Now, we have to move very quickly.
The Magisterium are on their way.
My father said they wouldn't get here.
He's already gone.
Where?!
Don't you worry. I will get you somewhere safe.
Roger! Roger!
Where's Roger? Tell me, Thorold! Where's Roger?
With Asriel.
What does he want with him?
Lyra... Lyra...
Energy.
Energy!
Lyra, I promised that I would protect you.
Thorold, he's going to cut him!
( Wind howls ) Iorek!
Iorek!
Iorek, I need you! Lyra!
What is it?
Follow the footprints! My father's got Roger. We need to go!
Bears!
You're calling the bears?
I have a feeling we'll be needing them. Climb on.
We'll need to move fast!
( Stelmaria growls ) What are we doing here? When's Lyra joining us?
I told you, she's coming with Thorold.
She'll be here soon. Come.
( Gunshot )
( Golden monkey grunts ) Don't touch anything.
There'll be traps everywhere.
Get the guards out of here.
No sign of anyone or anything.
The guards have gone to search the outside.
Plenty of people staying here, though.
Some sort of... encampment in the living area.
Any sense of where he might be?
Or what he's been... doing here?
Oh, Thorold, don't be ridiculous.
You won't hurt me.
I know you too well.
Plus, I'm unarmed.
He's gone up the mountain, hasn't he?
What's he trying to do?
His numbers suggest some kind of energy release.
This is Dust... isn't it?
Thorold... tell me who's with him.
What's he trying to do with Dust?
Flood us all with sin and darkness?
I know you have no respect for the Magisterium.
But in the name of the Authority, he who shines above us and lights the way, tell me what you know.
( Sighing ): Thorold...
I should throw you to the wolves.
But I won't.
I'll tell them that Father MacPhail is staying here to analyse what we've found.
And then I'll take the troops to pursue Asriel, and then you will leave.
He's always been so reckless.
He's never treated any of us well.
You included.
Hm.
( Laughter and chatter nearby )
( Door opens and closes )
( Police radio chatter )
( Door closes )
( Wind howls )
( Stelmaria growls ) Stay close!
What are you doing?
What's the surprise for Lyra?
( She pants )
( Wind howls )
( Faint whirring )
          IOREK They're heading for the mountain.
Bears, prepare yourself.
Bears spotted.
They're readying for an artillery attack.
Then open fire.
Agh!
Prepare the fire-hurlers!
Out of the way!
( Explosions )
( Screams )
Go! Go! Go!
( Gunfire )
( Rapid gunfire )
( She yells )
( Muffled explosions )
( Whooshing )
( Explosion )
          IOREK, MUFFLED Lyra!
Lyra!
Hurry, Lyra!
I'll get you to the mountain.
Isn't Lyra down there? I think we should go and find her.
Come here!
( Growling, squeaking )
          ROGER No!
What are you doing?!
Get in! No! Lord Asriel! No, stop! No!
No!
Lyra... I cannot cross this bridge.
Thank you... King Iorek Byrnison.
Thank you... Lyra Silvertongue.
Now go.
Quickly, Lyra.
( She exhales )
PAN
It's not far.
Just a few careful steps.
( She gasps ) ROGER Lord Asriel, please!
I'm sorry that this is happening to you.
But in war, there are casualties.
And believe me when I tell you that this is a war.
One that will free humanity forever.
Lyra!
          LYRA I can't do this, Pan!
          PAN Come on, Lyra. You can.
          LYRA Just fly up and see if you can see them.
We're nearly there.
They're just beyond the peak.
Asriel's put Roger and Salcilia in a cage.
They look like the ones at Bolvangar.
          ROGER No!
No!
( Roger screams )
( Roger yells ) Please don't do this!
Lyra will never forgive you.
          SALCILIA Roger, I can't get out!
What's going to happen to us?
No... No.
( He grunts )
( Roger screams )
( He grunts )
No... Roger, I don't want to leave you!
( Rumbling )
( Muffled rumbling, speech inaudible )
( He breathes quickly )
( Stelmaria growls ) If you've come to stop me, you're too late.
Too late to stop the experiment, yes, but not too late to stop you.
Oh, I am pleased that you came, Marisa, to see what I've done.
The Magisterium will never allow it.
Oh, you don't understand.
The Magisterium have no power anymore.
Not once the world sees the possibility of all this.
It is the end of the Magisterium.
After hundreds of years.
No more oppression.
No more abuse.
No more darkness... or suppression of knowledge.
You see that light?
That is the sun of another world.
Look.
Come.
Feel the warmth of it on your face.
( She gasps )
It's extraordinary.
( Both chuckle )
          ASRIEL There is no stopping it now.
My war was never just with the Magisterium.
There is a far more dangerous power out there.
Marisa, come with me.
Work with me.
Help me fight this war and take on the Authority.
Help me create a new Republic of Heaven.
What better place to make a new start?
A new start?
You and I. Together.
We could take this universe apart and put it back together again.
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, we couldn't...
Lie about whatever you want.
Lie about the Oblation Board.
The Magisterium.
Lie about the girl.
But do not lie about your ambition... your work... or who you truly are.
You used to want to change the world.
Then leave the Magisterium.
Come with me, and we will change them all.
But our child is in this world.
And my place is with her.
That is not a lie.
You want that?
I want her with everything I have.
This is your journey, not mine.
Goodbye, Asriel.
( Faint conversation )
( Police radio chatter )
( She groans )
          LYRA Roger...
( Pan squeaks ) His face is warm.
But Salcilia's gone.
          LYRA I thought he wanted the alethiometer.
I got it wrong.
I got it all... wrong.
We didn't mean this to happen.
But it did!
It did happen.
And I didn't get to say goodbye.
I didn't get to say I'm sorry.
And it's my fault.
It's all my fault.
I should never have brought you here.
What do I do, Roger?
Help me, please.
We need to find Dust.
We thought it was bad, because grown-ups said so.
What if it isn't?
What if it needs protecting?
You're saying... we could... go and find Dust before he does?
Do you know what that means, Pan?
We'd be alone.
We've always been alone... apart from... Roger.
Do we just... leave him?
We've got to make sure they don't win.
We've got to go, Roger.
All right?
Me and Pan... are going to go into the skies and we're going to search for Dust.
We will make sure your death is not in vain.
Goodbye, Roger.
