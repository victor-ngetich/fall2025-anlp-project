Tonight's the night.

And it's going to happen
again and again --

has to happen.

Nice night.

Miami is a great town.
I love the cuban food.

Pork sandwiches -- my favorite.

But I'm hungry for
something different now.

There he is -- Mike Donovan.

He's the one.

You're mine now,
so do exactly as I say.

- What do you want?
- I want you to be quiet.




Now drive.

Turn here.

Okay, you have to listen...

And do what I say.

- Look.
- No.

Yes.

- No, no.
- It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

Please.

Open your eyes and
look at what you did!

Look or I'll cut your
eyelids right off your face.

It took me a long time to
get these little boys clean.

One of them had been
in the ground so long

he was falling apart.
I pulled him out in bits and pieces.

Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is --




Stop! That never
helped anybody.

Please, you can have anything.

That's good. Beg.
Did these little boys beg?

I couldn't help myself.
I couldn't. I just --

Please, you have to understand.

Trust me, I definitely understand.
See, I can't help myself, either.

Children -- I could never do that.
Not like you.

- Never, ever kids.
- Why?

I have standards.

Soon... you'll be packed
into a few...

...neatly wrapped hefties

in my own small
corner of the world.

It'll be a neater,
happier place.

A better place.

My name is Dexter,
Dexter Morgan.

I don't know what
made me the way I am,

but whatever it was left
a hollow place inside.

People fake a lot of human
interactions, but I feel like

I fake them all, and
I fake them very well.

Ahoy, there, captain!
Any big marlin out there today?

And that's my burden, I guess.

But I don't blame my
foster parents for that.

Harry and Doris Morgan did
a wonderful job raising me.

But they're both dead now.

I didn't kill them... Honest.

- You're different, aren't you, Dexter?
- What do you mean, pop?

The Billups say
Buddy disappeared.

I found the grave, son.

That dog was a noisy
little creep, dad.

He was barking all night,
and mom couldn't sleep.

And she's very, very sick,
and that lousy dog was yapping

at every leaf that blew
down the sidewalk.

There were a lot of
bones in there, Dexter,

and not just Buddy's.

Hola, Dexter!

Blood --
sometimes it sets my teeth on edge.

Other times,
it helps me control the chaos.

The code of Harry,
my foster father, is satisfied.

And so am I.
Harry was a great cop here in Miami.

He taught me how to think like one,
taught me how to cover my tracks.

I'm a very neat monster.

Dexter, are you there?

Okay, Dex, please,
as soon as you get in,

I'm at a crime scene by the
shithole the Seven Seas motel,

and I need you here, okay?
Dex? Please.

Pretty fucking please
with cheese on top.

That's my foul-mouthed
foster sister, Debra.

She has a big heart but
won't let anyone see it.

She's the only person in
the world who loves me.

I think that's nice.
I don't have feelings about anything,

but if I could have feelings at all,
I'd have them for Deb.

There's something
strange and disarming

about looking at a homicide
scene in the daylight of Miami.

It makes the most grotesque
killings look staged,

like you're in a new and daring
section of Disney World --

Dahmer land.

You better be a cop.

No. Forensics.

Dex!

Hey, what's up?

Jeez, Deb,
where the hell do you keep your gun?

They found another
hooker in the pool.

- Another?
- Chopped up in bits and pieces.

- That's the third one in 5 months.
- Third? You mean there's a --

A serial killer, that's right.
The other 2 were in Broward,

- chopped up just like this one.
- Any suspects?

Wish I knew.

I'm on vice,
so Laguerta sent me to my room

and told me to stay out of sight.

God forbids she listens
to what you have to say.

Tell me about it.

How does someone so
dumb get so much power?

She knows how to play the game.
You could take a lesson.

- In what, ass-kissing?
- Politics.

I just want to catch this guy bere
he kills another one of my girls.

- You can't get so emotionally invested.
- You always say that.

So did dad.

Yeah, but he also said,
"go after what you want."

- I want out of Vice and into Homicide.
- What can I do to help?

You get these hunches, you know,
with these types of murders.

- Only sometimes.
- Well, see if you get one this time.

And can I bounce some
ideas off of you later?

I always get smarter
when I'm talking to you.

You just need a little
more confidence.

All right, I'll take a look.

In the meantime, avoid Laguerta
and talk to captain Matthews.

He and dad were tight.
Maybe he'll put you on the case.

You're making me
smarter already, see?

And keep the sex suit on when
you talk to the captain.

It'll help your cause.

- That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.
- Saw your sister.

- Damn, looking hot.
- Yeah, she should.

It's hot as hell out here.

- So... Why are you here?
- It's a crime scene.

- Yeah, but you do blood spatter.
- So?

So...
There's no blood here.

- What was that?
-Yeah. There's no blood in or on

or near the body at all.
It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

Hey, Angel, let's show him.

No blood.

No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood.
No blood at all.

Why hadn't I thought of that?
No blood.

What a beautiful idea.

How is he doing ? How does the
killer get rid of the blood?

It's hard to say.
The body's in good shape.

She got a nice ass, too.

Head is over there,
if you want to take a look.

- This is unique.
- No shit.

And no prints, either.

I've never seen such clean,
dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

Wonderful.

Very clean.

Yeah, but he didn't finish.
No termin?.

- It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.
- No, no. Look.

He cut the leg in four pieces,
almost like using a ruler.

But this leg is
in three pieces.

Now, look, he started to make
a fourth cut but stopped.

- It's possible he got interrupted.
- Laguerta's looking for a witness,

working on the motel
porter back there.

God help him.

No blood.

I can't think.
I have to get out of here.

Dex, ?d?nde va?
Where are you going?

Hey, no blood... No trabajo.

I wish she'd stop that.
It's one of those mating rituals

which I really
don't understand.

But that bloodless body --

this guy may have exceeded
my own abilities.

- Morning, Dex.
- Morning.

- Hey, Dex.
- Hey, Sue. Dan.

- How are the families?
- Good. You?

- See you at the next bloodbath?
- Never miss a party.

Thanks.

Salt of the earth, these people,
and they work hard.

But with the solve rate
for murders at about 20%,

Miami is a great place for me,
a great place for me to hone my craft.

Viva Miami.

Dex.

- I like your other outfit better.
- You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

Sex suit worked.
Captain put me on the case.

Laguerta wasn't happy,
but she needs to get laid.

- I guess. So congrats!
- So you got any ideas yet?

Nope.

Well, start working on
your mental autopsy

'cause I could use your theories.
And thanks for the fucking doughnut.

I got to go.

Doughnut?

You keeping your
fingernails clean?

Never leave home without
my rubber gloves.

Good boy.

So, anything new?

One of these days
you're gonna tell me.

I already told you.

Blood spatter doesn't
take up all my time.

I like doing it. Maybe I can help out.
It fills my nights.

- You have a morbid sense of fun.
- That's probably true.

- You should find a pretty girl.
- I found you.

Charming like your father.
Just don't get me fired.

Then who would I
bring doughnuts to?

- Angel, ?una m?s?
- Gracias.

De nada.

Just like me...

Empty inside.

- Where the hell you been?
- Crime scene.

What about these?

The hotel cokehead murders,
this dealer and the girl?

Well, this hallmark-looking couple

didn't die by the hands
of a professional.

No, this is child's play.
Messy work --

All that blood on the walls
looks like a finger painting.

You give me the fucking creeps,
you know that, Dexter?

Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

- Fuck you.
- Okay.

Is there something I can do?

You can give me a fucking analysis
on the blood spatter on this killings.

You think I'm here to invite
you to my nephew's bris?

I didn't know you were Jewish.

Shut the fuck up and
write your report already.

Don't even know why I need you.

Grab a crayon, psycho,
and scribble this down.

Rival dealer came in.

Two scumbags slashed to hell,
dealer stole the drugs.

Wham, bam, done.
And I don't give a shit what you say

because that's what happened
and that's who I'm looking for.

Hey, we are looking for a
motherfucking thief dealer.

- You got it?
- Okay. Sure.

I guess.
But I should get over there.

Then get over there already,
you fucking weirdo.

- I need it quick.
- I'm on it, sergeant.

The only real question I have is why,
in a building full of cops,

all supposedly with a keen
insight into the human soul,

is Doakes the only one who
gets the creeps from me?

So this killer used a sword?

No.
Probably a very sharp knife.

Look at the blood spatter.
Look at the patterns.

It tells a story.

You see this big pond
of blood right there?

That's from the initial stab.

The male victim was
standing right here,

and the killer plunged his
knife into the shoulder,

severing the carotid artery,
and -- blpph

- Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?
- Yeah, nice.

Now, over here, you have nice,
clean sprays of blood,

that can only happen when
you're holding something light

and moving quick --
nice, sharp slices through the body.

No splashes, no drips.
Clean and easy.

This guy knew how to use a blade.

So we're looking for a sushi chef.

Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

Wouldn't be my first choice,
but, hey, you never know.

- Now what?
- Now I eat.

The problem with
eating and driving,

which I love to do,
is not being able to employ

the 10:00-2:00 hand
position on the wheel.

It's a matter of public safety.

But there's always a sacrifice.

This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

Six months ago, I think he fell
in love with a pretty brunette,

Mrs. Jane Saunders --

A sweet mother of two married
to a successful banker --

All living a pleasant life until she,
unfortunately, disappeared,

leaving the kids emotionally
devastated forever.

The cops arrested
my favorite valet,

but his lawyer got him off
on a faulty search warrant.

It's a good thing I
don't bother with them.

Animals don't like me,
especially dogs.

I don't think they approve

of what I sometimes
do to their masters.

That dog recognizes me as easily
as I can recognize Jaworski

or any other killer.

Interesting taste
in literature.

His needs are evolving,
turning violent.

He's on the fast track.

Have you ever wanted
to kill anything else?

You know,
something bigger than a dog?

- Yes.
- Like a person?

Yeah, but no one in particular.

Why didn't you?

I thought you and
mom wouldn't like it.

Come here.

Friday night.
Date night in Miami.

Every night is
a date night in Miami,

and everyone's having sex.

But for me, sex never
enters into it.

I don't understand sex.

Not that I have
anything against women,

and I certainly have an
appropriate sensibility about men,

but when it comes to
the actual act of sex,

it's always just seemed so...

undignified.

But I have to play the game.

And after years of
trying to look normal,

I think I met the
right woman for me.

Deb saved her life on a
domestic-dispute call,

introduced us,

and we've been dating
for six months now.

She's perfect because Rita is,
in her own way, as damaged as me.

I'm running late.
I'll just be a sec.

- I have to change.
- Okeydoke.

Hi, Dexter.

May I say that you look
lovely this evening?

Okay.

Master Cody, handsome as ever.
High five.

Do the space shuttle.

Vanilla... Chocolate,
and strawberry.

- No coffee?
- Which one do you think melts faster?

Ready?

Rita's ex-hubby,
the crack addict,

repeatedly raped her,
knocked her around.

Ever since then, she's been
completely uninterested in sex.

That works for me.

Will you be back?

- Of course I'll be back.
- I meant Dexter.

- You'll be asleep.
- No, I won't.

Then I'll stop in and
we'll all play cards.

Texas hold 'em?

Give mommy a kiss.

- Ready?
- Yeah.

Needless to say,
I have some unusual habits,

yet all these socially
acceptable people

can't wait to pick up hammers and
publicly smash their food to bits.

Normal people are so hostile...
But not her.

Where are we going?

They might need me.

Just stay right there.
I'll be right back.

- Son of a whore.
- Who?

Talking about this hijo de puta,
this asshole killer,

this maric?n savage who makes
us work on a Friday night.

Only Mondays through Thursdays --
that's what I always say.

Of course, co?o, be reasonable.
Who wants to work on a Friday night?

I have my needs.

So, ?c?mo est?s?
What are you doing here?

I was in the neighborhood.
I'm on a date.

- A date? Nice.
- Same guy, same pattern.

Bone dry. No blood again.
Pero mira esto.

There's some small differences
in the cuts this time.

Over here -- rough, almost emotion.

Then over here, not so much.

- And then over here -- clean.
- Muy bien.

Yeah, nice. But look at this.

All bone.

The killer flayed the skin,
the flesh, completely off.

- Now, why would he do that?
- He's experimenting.

He's trying to
find the right way.

Is he experimenting
with the head, too?

What do you mean?

La bestia left her tits
and took her fucking head.

I don't find anyone
around here.

And God only knows what
he's doing with it.

He's certainly
raising the bar. Damn!

This guy is good.

- Will they catch him soon?
- I doubt it.

The killer is an artist.

What do you mean?

His technique...

is incredible.

I'm sorry.
I don't think I want to.

I mean, I'm --
I'm not ready.

Damn it, Dexter.

What have I done now ?

And why can't I get that neat stack
of body parts out of my head?

No blood.

Why did I touch her that way?

I need to get back to my work.

Jaworski's website,
"scream-bitch-scream" --

the mother of all rape sites.

That's it.
He's definitely the one.

Now it's just a matter of time

before he becomes a drop of blood
in my glass-slide collection.

But I have to wait.

I have to be careful

and follow the code of Harry.

Hey, dad.

- I can explain.
- You and I had an understanding.

Whenever you get an urge,
you come to me,

you tell me,
and we deal with it together.

- I do tell you, dad.
- The hell you do!

- There's blood on this knife.
- Animals. I find animals, that's all.

Are you sure?
Are you telling me the truth?

- Yes!
- I thought we had this under control.

You still don't remember
anything from before,

- you know, before we took you in?
- No.

Is that why I have these urges?

What happened changed
something inside you.

It got into you too early.

I'm afraid your urge to kill
is only gonna get stronger.

You're saying I'll be
like this forever.

You're a good kid, Dex.
You are.

Otherwise, it would have been
a lot worse than animals.

Okay?
We can't stop this.

But maybe...

We can do something
to channel it.

- Use it for good.
- How could it ever be good?

Son, there are people out
there who do really bad things.

Terrible people.
And the police can't catch them all.

Do you understand
what I'm saying?

You're saying
they deserve it.

That's right.

But, of course,
you have to learn how to spot them,

how to cover your tracks.

But I can teach you.

- Dad...
- It's okay, Dex.

You can't help what happened to you,
but you can make the best of it.

Remember this forever --
you are my son,

you are not alone,
and you are loved.

Okay.

Preparation is vital.

No detail can be overlooked.

And the ritual is intoxicating.

Duct tape...

Rubber sheets...

Necessary tools of the trade.

You can't bullshit me, Dex.

Help me out.
Laguerta has me interviewing hookers.

It's a waste of time.

Deb, if he was
interrupted... Think.

Jesus Christ, right.

Because then how do you have
time to wrap all the pieces?

She's dumber than the boat people.
Throw her a fucking raft.

But now we have a fourth body,
and the cuts were different.

And that's telling us a story.
The ritual is changing.

He's looking for some kind of
inspiration and not finding it.

So he keeps doing it
until he gets it right.

I could be wrong.

So how the hell was your
date with Rita last night?

Great.

You should try it sometime.
You need a life.

Well, find me a guy I can trust.
I need a transfer to Homicide, bro,

then we'll see about a life.

I understand that.
It certainly would sound

better for the kids to say,
"mommy's on Homicide."

- Don't make me hit you.
- Come on.

Then we could talk about more
little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

- What's wrong with that?
- You sound like mom.

I just -- tell me what you know
about cell crystallization.

- What do you mean?
- I heard the coroner say it last night.

He was talking about
that dead... headless chick.

- You got that look in your eye.
- I was there before you,

and I noticed this body looked
different than the other ones.

The pieces were cold.

But meat-packing cold.

Is that what cell
crystallization means?

My god, why didn't I think of that?
It's beautiful.

Dex.
What are you thinking?

Sorry.
That makes sense.

Cold.

It slows the flow of blood.

Why the hell is that important?

- It's just a feeling.
- That's not good enough.

I got to show Laguerta and her boys.
They're making fun of me.

They're saying the only way
I can close a case is on my back.

I got to get out of Vice.
Dex, please, you got to --

Refrigerated truck.

What the fuck are
you talking about?

A refrigerated truck.

He wants a cold environment

to slow the flow of blood,

clean and mobile so he can
dump the garbage afterwards.

So I'm looking for a
refrigerated truck now?

Probably a stolen one.

You think there are a lot
of stolen trucks out there?

Are you nuts?
In Miami?

Choir... kids... Just
do something.

Just find my husband.

Ma'am, the detectives are
looking into everything.

I'm pretty sure I
covered all my tracks.

- What do you care about that woman?
- I don't. I was just --

You like when women cry?
You like that?

What's your thing, psycho?

I was just heading to
the briefing room.

You got no call to be in there,
so flee.

Lieutenant, this fucking
guy doesn't belong.

I'm still waiting for
his spatter report

on the cokehead murders --
Go do that.

It's okay.
I don't want to upset anybody.

He can stay.
I'd like your input,

and we'll discuss your
case after the meeting.

How about we get started?

- ?Encontr?ste algo?
- Nada todav?a.

- Hazme un favor y qu?tate la gorra.
- Disc?lpame.

- You ready?
- I'm gonna shame this bitch.

Just state your case clean and easy.
You'll be the hero.

Okay, settle down.

Now, has anyone tracked
down that witness?

Come on, people.
Someone needs to find something here.

- Lieutenant Laguerta?
- Officer Morgan.

I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

I have an idea,
something in a different direction.

An idea?

Well, please, share it with us.

- Cell crystallization.
- Excuse me?

A little more confidence,
please.

On the last victim.

I'd like to check and see
if any refrigerated trucks

have been stolen in
the last... week or so.

Refrigerated trucks
like ice-cream trucks?

No, not ice-cream trucks.

A refrigerated vehicle

that could cause that
kind of tissue damage,

a refrigerated truck that's...

...mobile so he'll be
harder to catch,

a refrigerated truck that
might give us a lead.

That's very interesting,
very creative.

Let's keep looking
for the witness, okay?

We know that he or she is out there.
The forensic evidence,

the interrupted cut proves
that there was an eyewitness.

Now, somebody out
there saw something,

so let's concentrate on
finding that person, okay?

- But --
- Just keep talking to all your hookers.

That's all for today.

What the fuck was I supposed to say?
The only reason I'm in here

is because the captain said
they had to let me in.

But he didn't say they
had to listen to you.

Well, right again.

So say adi?s to my career.
I'm gonna die a meter maid.

Stop it. Deb, there's another way.
Find the truck.

Excuse me, Dexter...
My office, please.

What the hell?

What the fuck?

Are you boning her?

- No.
- Oh, my god!

- Deb, wait.
- Shut up.

It had nothing to
do with drugs.

L.T., this is a waste
of our damn time.

I think sergeant
Doakes is right.

I read the other reports,
all the other forensic analysis.

Everyone agrees the cokehead murders
had nothing to do with cocaine.

It was a crime of passion.

The murderer came to kill
the woman, not the dealer.

He did him quick and
got him out of the way.

But he sure as hell took his
sweet time slicing up that lady,

and you don't do that
unless you have a close,

personal relationship with someone.
Probably an ex-boyfriend.

That's who I'd look for.

Okay.

It's a bit of a push, but,
sergeant, you should check it out.

I'm watching you, motherfucker.

Jaworski's been coming
here for weeks --

likes to steal all
the copper plumbing.

There's good money in that.

No security guards --
that's good.

- Fuck!
- Talk.

- What do you mean?
- I think you know what I mean.

- No. Oh, god.
- Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

Okay.
I did her.

- How?
- In a movie -- snuff film.

- But I'm not sorry.
- Of course not.

No, I'm not sorry, either.

- Hello?
- Hey. I'm -- I'm sorry.

I mean,
I'm sorry about the other night,

but... look, Dex, I really,
really need to see you.

So can you --
can you come by later,

you know, just for,
like, a little while?

I mean, I'm really --

All right.
What are you doing now?

I'm just finishing
up a little project,

but I'll come by later.

Okay, bye.

All in all,
it was a good night.

One less amateur filmmaker
polluting the internet.

No way !

Give us a minute.

Hanging in there?

This will teach me to tailgate.

Let's go over this again.

- I'm all yours.
- So all the ice trucks in Miami --

- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?
- Sure, during business hours.

But this time of night,
a truck like that sticks out.

And you followed it.

That's right.

- You never saw the driver?
- Just high beams and a flying head.

So then he must have already had
the head with him in the front seat.

That's weird.
Why would he keep it there?

I don't know,
so he could use a carpool lane?

It just seems odd.
Your sister has this ice-truck theory,

and then here you
are to back it up.

She's good, lieutenant.
You should give her a chance.

You know,
you should call me Maria.

But I'll tell you who's good --
you are.

Doakes picked up the killer
in the cokehead murders.

You were right.
It was her boyfriend.

Of course, Doakes
still hates you.

Of course.

Tell me, Dexter,

how did you get
to be so smart?

Lots of sleep.

Is it okay if I fill out
that report tomorrow?

Sure thing.
You're tired.

- Good night, lieutenant.
- I'll catch you later.

Dex.
It's been a while.

- I'm sorry.
- I was worried.

I didn't know what to do.
I called in sick.

I mean...

- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I was just --

I'm sorry.
There was another... You know.

Look... The kids
slept over next door.

Okay.

- Would you like to come in?
- Okay.

Okay.

I don't want to lose you, Dex.

Okay, sure.

And... well... I want you.

I mean...

Okay.
Thanks.

You're welcome.

- Do you mind?
- No.

- It could be the kids.
- Better get it, then.

Hello?

Cody.

Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

All right.
I'll come get you.

Cody just threw up all
over Colleen's couch.

I got to go get him.

- Tell me we're okay.
- Better than.

- Okay.
- Go be a good mom.

Okay, that was close.

I'll admit,
making out with Rita was...

Interesting.

But if I don't keep a lid on this,

it could be the end of us.

I suppose I should be upset,
even feel violated,

but I'm not.

No.

In fact,
I think this is a friendly message,

kind of like,
"hey, want to play?"

And, yes, I want to play.

I really, really do.


Previously on Dexter...

No blood. What a beautiful idea.

Brother, I just found the fucking ice truck.

It is my new friend.

When he broke into my apartment,
he took some time to get to know me -

my life, my secrets.

Paul doesn't live here anymore.

No shit.
He's in jail.

But, see, he still owes me
for two ounces of blow,

which means you owe me.

The coyote wanted more money,
I didn't have it.




Poor bastards - spend their life savings,
get stuffed into a fishhold.

- If they can't pay...
- They disappear.

Jorge Castillo -

the only suspect even
remotely close to the park

where Yelina was supposed
to drop the money.

Excuse me.
Private yard.

Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

American, pal, just like you.

Just like me.

Coño.

Get back in there, you Cuban piece of shit.

They're even better-matched than I thought.

Fucking animals.

God bless America.




No.

Taking the extra time to kill Valerie
may have been ill-advised.

My life has always been a sequence
of carefully planned moments.

But sometimes
you just have to take a risk.

Life is so fleeting, so fragile,

every breath the potential to be our last.

You ready?

Can I have my cereal now?

We all grieve in our own way.

Sure.

I prefer the six-year-old approach.

Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

Well, not quite.

Hey, what about this one?

I want angel cake.

It's angel food, stupid,
and you don't get a vote.

It's my birthday.

Guys.

So, how'd it go?

Bob the goldfish, may he rest in peace.

Thanks for coming over
and taking care of this for me.

- Dead stuff.
- I know.

Well, go have a seat.

Your treat for coming over early
is on its way.

I don't get birthdays - the party, the song.

Celebrating another year
just being alive feels forced.

That one.
That's the one I want.

- Coconut it is.
- I hate coconut.

You've never had coconut.

It's dispatch.
I might have to settle for toast to go.

Sure, what's the location?

I'll be right there.

The crime scene.

My crime scene.

I shouldn't have killed them both.
I didn't have enough time.

A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood.

What did I leave behind?

Impossible.

Nice place setting, huh?
We're running her prints now.

It had to be him.
He's watching me.

Good.

ID the victim.

- You find anything else?
- That ain't enough?

Any eyewitnesses?

Just do your job.
Worry about the blood.

You gonna answer that?

This tin can smells like ass.

The sooner you get busy,
the sooner we can finger who did this.

You heard the man.

He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

He's getting back at me
for not killing that security guard.

Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck killer.
I've got the press sniffing outside.

No, it's not his M.O.

We got an ID. Valerie Castillo.
Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

Well, then, try and track him down.

Sir, we found something.

You got anything?

No bruising.
Nothing under her nails.

She didn't put up a fight.

If she was killed here, which I doubt, whoever
did it was a real pro.

Under normal circumstances,
I'd take that as a compliment.

- Prints?
- She's clean.

This trailer - that's another matter.

I don't even want to know
what some of those stains are.

Yo, Dex, I think I found something.
Zoom in on this, will you?

I'm kind of low on batteries here.

Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

Yo, what's up with you today?
You're throwing off my chi.

You're not Chinese.

I'm not?

Look, right here.

Does that look like a needle mark to you?

It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

Yeah, I guess.

I'm gonna let the coroner bag her.

I'm hungry.

This ain't no auto garage.

Oh, God.
Oh, I didn't need to see that.

You never seen
a latrine before, Morgan?

Yeah, just not indoors.

- Well, the army taught me a lot of things.
- I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

Digging holes for people to take a dump?
That was most important.

I'm not really getting that.

It doesn't matter how many bars
you got on your collar.

Everybody's shit stinks.
We were partners a long time.

From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's
better half was knee-deep.

- You like the husband for this?
- It's always the husband.

What have you got?

It looks like a phone number
and a name - Mariel.

Call it in to Batista.
He can run it down for us.

Sergeant Doakes.

We heard movement in the trunk.

I got it. I got it.

You all right, kid? Come on, man.

- No.
- Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

The noose is tightening.

This is how it ends -
in the hands of a seven-year-old?

Hey, Deb.

I usually like kids.

Who's the boy?

All we got so far is that he's Cuban
and he seems to like LaGuerta.

Spend enough time in a trunk,
she'd look good to anybody.

Did he, you know, see anything?

I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.
Social services is on the way.

You OK? You got a whole
brow thing going on.

Morgan, bring some water!

I love her.

Maybe I should spend some time
in a hot trunk, too.

My neat little world of lies
is crumbling all around me,

and I can't tell a soul,
especially not Deb.

- Deb, we've been through this.
- But I have my books.

I could just stay in the car
or I can walk with you guys.

I promise I'll be quiet.
You won't even know I'm there.

The pheasants will know you're there.

- But Dexter was my age when...
- Deb, that's enough.

The Logans are waiting.
Did you pack your swimsuit?

- Yes.
- Good girl.

I want to see that backflip
when we come home.

All right. Go on out to the car.
We'll be there in a sec.

She does kind of have a point, Dad.

What we do your sister
can never know about.

Keeping the truth from the people
closest to you is how you'll survive...

and how you'll protect them
if anything goes wrong.

Guys, hurry up.

You're gonna be late for school.

I'm headed to the store.
Is there anything else you want?

- Balloons aren't much of a list.
- It's OK.

I don't need that other stuff.
It's too expensive.

How about you let me worry
about that stuff, OK?

It's your party.
You can have whatever you want.

- Hello?
- Hey, babe, it's me.

Go wait in the car.

What's wrong with Mom?

She only gets that way
when she's talking to Dad.

I was able to track down that name, Mariel,
with the number that you called in.

She's a Cuban refugee.
She's staying with cousins.

- I had a car bring her in.
- Why scratch the number in the floor?

Next of kin, in case something
happened to her.

Guys like Castillo are ruthless.
They prey on families.

He was holding Mariel and
six others captive at a salvage yard.

That explains the garage.

If the relatives don't pay the release fee,
the coyote would dump their ass overboard.

Cocksuckers make me sick.
Come on.

Mariel, when was the last time
you saw Jorge Castillo?

When he locked her
and the other refugees up

after pulling them from the boat.

They went without food and water.

Some guy tried to escape,
but he was beaten by Jorge.

How'd she get free?

Somebody opened the door to the garage.

She said, "When we find them,
to make them suffer for what they did,

"especially that concha
that treated her like a dog."

Ah, got you.

Fuck me.
The wife was in on it.

Ask if she knows the little boy
social services picked up.

She never saw a boy.

No hair, no fibers,
C.O.D. exsanguination.

So far, so good.

- You're hovering.
- Keep reading. Wait for it.

This is a prelim. I don't have time...

M-fucking-99.

Etorphine hydrochloride?

An animal tranquilizer
more powerful than morphine.

It causes total paralysis.

That mark on her neck kept bugging me,
so I ordered up a tox screen.

That's it.
No more doughnuts for Masuka.

Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

The only way to get it
is with a D.E.A. license.

I put a request in for the list.

- I should have it for Doakes in the morning.
- Nice.

Yeah, baby.

I'm on that list, and eventually the alias
I used will lead them back to me.

Tick-tock.

Hey, you.

Thank God you're there.

- I really need to talk with someone.
- Everything OK?

Paul called after you left.

- Paul? Who's Paul?
- My soon-to-be ex.

He's already out of jail, overcrowding.
Can you believe it?

Every time something goes a little bit right,
something like this happens.

- He wants to come to Astor's party.
- What did you tell him?

I'd have to think about it.
But even if I say no, he won't listen.

He never does.

Can you come over tonight?

I'm kind of under the gun here, big case.

I shouldn't be dumping all this on you.
I'm sorry.

No, don't be.

Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can.
I promise.

OK. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

Thanks. Bye.

Check the marinas.
Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

We'll search the house.

- Where's LaGuerta?
- Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

- Sketch?
- He told social services

that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

Valerie Castillo?

Sounds like she got exactly
what she had coming to her.

Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

Yeah, you say that now.

Found his passport.

God, I feel like I need a shower
just looking at this douche bag.

Well, keep searching. Phone records,
bank accounts, credit cards.

Maybe the wife got greedy, and he killed her.

Maybe.

This morning,
what was that thing by the car?

What thing?

Before you opened the trunk,
you tried to cockblock me.

I was just looking out for my team.

I didn't see you looking out for LaGuerta.

- I would if she'd asked.
- I didn't ask.

Fine.
Next time, just get your ass shot.

- It's possible our guy left town.
- If he even did it.

- What if we have a copycat killer?
- That's a bit of a stretch.

What if the person
who killed Valerie Castillo

tried to bleed her out like
the ice-truck killer but didn't know how?

- She wasn't a hooker.
- She was killed someplace else

and laid out in a ritualistic manner,
just like all the others.

- She wasn't in pieces.
- She had cuts on her neck.

I'm just saying, with all the media coverage
on the ice-truck killer,

it's possible.

What do you suggest, Morgan?

Let me work up a profile
in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

Fine. Whatever.

That's the second time
you've made that face.

Who are you avoiding?

We got one more stop to make.

Nothing lasts forever.

Just ask a Ford Pinto.

Eventually, most serial killers get caught.

There's really not much
of a retirement plan.

But it can't end like this. It's too soon.
I'm not ready.

He saw me.

What's this?

You've been asking who's been calling.
My mom lives here.

- Did you forget your laundry?
- She's been on me to stop by for dinner.

Now, here's the plan.
We go in. We eat.

We out before the cheesecake.
You got it?

- I'm, what, your exit strategy?
- You can stay out here if you want.

That gives me a better excuse
to leave earlier,

or you can come in
and have some free food.

It's your call.

Shit.

My sisters are here, too.

Fucking family reunion.

This john comes out of nowhere.
He's got me by the throat.

I can't reach around and get my gun,
and I see he has a nipple ring.

I rip that fucker out
like it's a grenade pin.

Morgan.

Oh, I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

We're used to it.

When James graces his family
with his presence.

Some of us don't work at a bank.

First words out of my
baby brother's mouth were,

"Got milk, motherfucker?"

Oh, OK, now, that's enough, all of you.

That security guard is gonna be all right?

If someone did a hatchet job on me,
I'd cash it all in.

Yeah, Tony's doing OK.

The hospital's setting him up
with some prosthetics.

He's just got this spirit about him.

The guy's missing body parts
because of this ice-truck killer,

and he's still hitting on me.

That's because men only think
with one body part,

and that one was not cut off.

Well, it's the damn truth.

Morgan, come on.
We got a case to solve.

Oh, are you sure, honey?
I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

Yeah. We're sure.

You know...
I would love some cheesecake.

You can wait in the car.
That's your call.

He'll wait.

I'll help you.
I'm sorry.

I wonder, in time,
if they'll even remember me,

other than the man
who broke their mother's heart.

I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

He is their father. They have a right to know
he's been released, right?

Yeah, sure.

Even if I tell Paul not to come,
he'll show up here eventually.

I know him.

Everything's been going so good at work...

With you.

I don't know what to do.

He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

Paul always had a temper,
but when he was using...

He said if I left, he would find us
and hurt the kids.

Somehow, I thought that by staying,
I was protecting them.

Cody doesn't remember the worst of it,
but Astor...

She was the one who called
the police the last time.

She was protecting me.

You're not that woman anymore.
You're stronger than that now.

If their dad shows up,
we'll deal with it together.

Dad's coming home?

Can he sleep in my room, Mom?
Can he, Mom?

I shouldn't even be here.

Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

Her husband was a crackhead,
and her boyfriend's a serial killer.

It's kind of hard
not to take that personally.

Better get inside, son.
Storm's on its way.

Why didn't you tell me
what you are, Dex?

Any last words?

Figures.

I don't have bad dreams.

When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

Nothing ever goes bump
in Dexter's night.

I've never felt a moment
of remorse, doubt, regret.

What's happening to me?

If my back wasn't against the wall,

I'd almost feel guilty for
hacking into Masuka's email.

Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

And there I am.

Dr. Patrick Bateman -

so wholesome, so inconspicuous.

Harry would frown upon
destroying evidence,

but he never wanted me
to get caught, either.

What are you doing in here?

My computer went down.
I was just checking some email.

Can you take a look at this for me?

- Copycat killer?
- I worked all night on that profile.

I'd like to give it to LaGuerta,

- but I want to make sure it's good enough.
- I'm honored.

"The similar manner in which
the body was displayed

"suggests this killer feels a connection
to the ice-truck killer.

"Excited by what he's doing.

"The cut on the victim's cheek,
while not fatal,

"appears to be a signature of sorts.

"Because of the lack of evidence
collected from the crime scene,

"the suspect may be familiar with
law enforcement or forensics procedure."

Why'd you quit?
You're getting to the good stuff.

Let me guess -
single white male, mid-30s, lives alone,

disconnected from his emotions.

- It's a little textbook, don't you think?
- But it totally fits this case.

You're trying to make it fit.

My advice?
Keep this to yourself.

- Really?
- Deb, you're new to Homicide.

This blows up in your face,
you've given LaGuerta the excuse

to send you back to Vice.

No. I'm onto something here. I feel it.

Like one of your hunches.

Way to have my back.

Where's your sister?

Debra, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

How did you get into my cabinet?

You hide the key in the pantry
on the top shelf.

You and your brother know
never to touch my guns

unless it's under my direct supervision.

But I was being really careful.

I mean, I was only shooting
at the cans and the bottles.

And I'm really good, like Dexter,

and now we can all go hunting together.

I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

Grab your things.

Thanks a lot.

Starting this morning,
we have cadets from the Academy

going over every inch of the salvage yard.

Those days I don't miss.

The kid we found yesterday
saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo.

Because he didn't recognize
a photo of Jorge Castillo,

Lieutenant LaGuerta is bringing him in
to attempt a sketch.

Come on, sweetheart.

Let's take the seatbelt off.

There you go. Come on.

Come on, sweetheart.

You want to go inside
to see the nice lady?

Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

Thanks for bringing him by.

Normally, I wouldn't approve
of something like this,

but you've made quite an impression.

- You have kids?
- No.

I was like him once.
A stranger in a strange place,

left to grow up with strangers,
all for a better life.

Well, police lieutenant,
I'd say you've done OK.

- Any luck with the family?
- No. He talks about an uncle Roberto.

- He just uses the first name.
- Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

I hope so.

I hate to send another one into foster care.

Thank you.

Bye, sweetheart.

Meanwhile, we'll follow up
on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

That would include vets, doctors,
animal control, even circuses.

Be thorough. Check everyone.

Masuka, what do we have
on the home and the boat?

Still processing, sir.

If the husband is a dead end,
then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

Morgan, any ideas?

Don't do it, Deb.

The last thing I need right now
is to be profiled for all of Miami Metro.

We could be looking at someone
who's inspired by the ice-truck killer.

If so, the suspect is probably familiar
with forensic procedures.

I have a profile.
I'd be happy to show it to you.

I'll be in my lab.

Hello, Dex.

I'll be right back.

No.

I forgot how much I loved
pastelitos growing up.

He just needed
a little reminder of home.

I was barely his age
when I came over with my family.

I threw up the whole damn way.

Go get the artist.
I think somebody's ready.

Save me some.

Did you thank Mrs. Carroll
for picking you up from school for me?

Yes.

So, what do you think?

Everything OK?

You want to talk about it?

Holly, Blake, and Ashley said
they can't come to my party.

Honey, that's not true.
I spoke with their moms last week.

It's all Cody's fault.

He couldn't keep his mouth shut
about dad getting out of jail.

- Did not!
- You told everyone!

I have to know.

Dexter...

Thank God. My arm's asleep.

- How long have you two been like this?
- Half an hour.

I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

At that age,
when they're out, they're out.

You could brush his teeth,
and he wouldn't wake up.

Here. Lift up his head.
I'll slide this underneath.

Oh, thanks.

What are you doing here?

I'm waiting on some lab work.
I had some time to kill.

Go ahead.
We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

It's only a matter of time before we know
what this little guy saw.

Come on.

If you... Here.

You want help or not?

I have a hair or something
stuck on my lens.

You're in good hands.

I traded my glasses in
for contacts in high school.

Boys?

Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

I had Winnie the Poohs
on my bras until I was 16.

As you can see, not a whole
lot's changed since then.

Try not to blink, OK?

OK, OK. I'll do it.

I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.
Your brother's adopted, right?

Yeah, my dad found him
at a crime scene.

How did the department feel about Harry
getting personally involved in a case?

It didn't seem to be a problem.
My parents never talked about it.

Oh, but still, raising a boy,
it's a lot of work, no?

God, no.

I got in more trouble than he did.
He was the perfect one.

Here, I think I see it.

Yeah.

There's the bastard.

Thanks.

Let me ask you a question.

Why do you have it in for me?

You're loud, impulsive,
and constantly question authority.

Fair enough.

I hear you have an interesting theory on...

The report on scandal-plagued
AFL's transactions in Florida

showed Transportation Department employees

received more than $460 in gifts,
ranging from golf balls and free dinners...

Honey, what is it?

...In return for buying supplies
worth $7,000...

Sweetie.

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

It's all right. These things happen.

Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

Mommy?

Is it OK if I didn't have my party?

It's only a matter of time
before that boy tells the police

who he saw that night
at the salvage yard - me.

Once the sketch is finished,
there will be no place left to hide.

If I want any chance of survival,
I have to get rid of it all.

I have to let go.

Alex Timmons - sniper.

Yes, I did it.
Is that what you want to hear?

Gene Marshall - arsonist.

Have you ever watched someone
burned alive?

Cindy Landon - black widow.

I'll fuck you if you let me go.

Such fond memories of them all.

They all accepted their fate
in their own way.

Now it's time for me to do the same.

Valerie Castillo - my last victim.

He's not angry.
That's not what this is about.

He's testing me.

I was wrong the whole time.

My playmate saw an opportunity
to paint me into a corner

to see if I'd find my way out,
if I'd fight to survive.

If you have a well-preserved sample,

transferring a dry drop
of blood is relatively easy,

Almost as easy as it was

lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from
his boat and putting them on this knife.

Just got off the phone with the FBI.

Now for the hard part.

I wanted to see what their computers
would spit out.

I cross-referenced my profile
with the ice-truck killer list.

11 new hits.

How about we hold off till we get a sketch,
take it from there.

I know, I know.

I want to get a head start on this.

We could look these over at lunch. My treat.

You never give up, do you?

Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

Can't remember the last time I met
a guy's family and they actually liked me.

You held your own.

Most people don't get
a dirty word in edgewise

with my sisters around the table.

In our house, every Thursday night was
pancake night - Morgan tradition.

I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

I found something.

The wife's blood?
You're sure?

This was found in
the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

We check all the clothing items
that come in.

Because of sheer volume,
that takes time.

- It doesn't prove anything.
- Not by itself.

I've been re-examining the video footage
I took from that morning.

Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.
They're long and deep.

Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

No shit.

The person who did this
wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck killer.

He was in a hurry.

- He was probably afraid of getting caught.
- Most killers are.

Except if this was a copycat,
he wouldn't be in a rush.

He would savor his first kill.

He would control the precise moment
Valerie Castillo died

instead of just letting her bleed out.

This is all too...

passive.

Have you completely ruled out the husband?

Why are you doing this?

The boy said he didn't recognize
Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

He was a dehydrated
and traumatized seven-year-old

left to fend for himself
for days in a salvage yard.

You really think it's the husband?

He's a deep-sea fisherman.
Most know how to use a knife.

Plus, he's still missing.

Have you finished your search
of the salvage yard?

I'll have them send the cadets out again.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I know how hard you worked on that profile.

No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

How long are you grounded for?

Two months.

- Deb, I had to tell him.
- No, Dex, you didn't.

You could have kept
your fucking mouth shut.

Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

Well, now you can spend
more time together.

I'm not stupid, Dexter.
That's always what you wanted.

No, it's not.

- Deb, you're my sister.
- No, I am not.

And he is my father.

There are so many times, I swear,

that I wish he would have
never brought you home.

Dexter, I am so sorry.

I really, really didn't mean it like that.

Here.

I thought you might want that.

You're a better shot than me anyway.

Hello?

Paul, hey, it's me.

- Look, we need to talk.
- Sure thing.

I know you want to see Astor,

but, I mean,
the kids are doing so well now.

Maybe it would be a good idea
if you don't come to the party.

She is my daughter, too, Rita.
I have every right to be there.

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I have full custody now,

and you can't just drop in
on us like this anymore.

Now, I checked.

The restraining order is still in effect.

If you step one foot on this property,
the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

The second is to your parole officer.

I need a sergeant.

I'll be right there.

The uncle called our office this morning.

He lives in Tampa.

That's great. He should be with family.

Can I take him home?

We're good.

Thank you.

Thank you for finding him, huh?
He's a very special boy.

I know.

Lieutenant, you need to see this.

You OK?

These contacts.

Wrecks like this
are usually sold for scrap.

The husband stashes a knife inside

and lets a demo crew shred
the truck before we find it.

No more murder weapon.

- There's blood.
- Want to bet it's the wife's?

It's always the husband.
You were right all along.

Shake it off, Morgan.
Homicide takes time.

Deb will forgive me eventually.

That's who she is -

bighearted, kind, nothing like me.

LaGuerta thought
you should see this.

That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

Son of a bitch.

Dex.

OK, I gave them Jorge's sock,

a knife with his prints,
and a drop of his wife's blood.

Forensics trifecta like that
should trump a child's drawing...

I hope.

Too fucking weird.

Jesus Christ saved this kid.

On his own for as long as Oscar was,
who's to say he didn't?

When did lighting candles
become more fun than blowing them out?

Nice turnout.

I called all the moms to assure them

that Paul would not
be making an appearance.

Do Astor and Cody know
that you told their dad not to come?

After presents.

Ready?

Make a wish, baby.

Just don't tell anybody,
or it won't come true.

It already came true.
Dad's not here.

I want the middle piece.

OK.

I was wrong about birthdays.

Maybe the reason to celebrate
them is what they offer -

the hope of living to see another one.

The thing about Deb forgiving me,

I better give her a few more days.

I barely escaped getting caught this time.

I realize now my days are numbered.

So I better make the most of them.

All along, I thought this was a game
my alter ego and I were playing.

But relationships change,

evolve,

and this one's getting deep.

Like Harry said in my dream...

...the storm's on its way.

Previously on Dexter...

I got here as fast as I could.
What are we looking at?

Female victim cut up into pieces.

The ice-truck killer? So soon?

This is what he wanted me to find all along.

Laura Moser...

My mother.

Laura Moser and three others
found chopped up with a chainsaw.

Your father was a decent man
and an honest cop,

but what he saw in that
cargo container changed him.

You think it's the attacker's blood?




We know Batista fought back.

The samples were a match.
They're from the same person.

So if you or that bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

I swear to God,
I don't care who I have to hurt.

Let's face it, Paul.
You've been a problem.

I need you to explain
to them why you're here.

I have no fucking idea
why I'm in this place.

You really don't want to do this.

Effective immediately,
you will no longer serve as my Lieutenant.

This isn't fucking over, Tom!

Debra Morgan...

will you marry me?

Yes, yes, yes.

Where's my sister?




Took her Code 12.
Left about an hour ago.

She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

You made it easy.

So desperate to fall in love.

Where the fuck are you?

I'm at work and you're not.
I need to talk to you.

Do not see Rudy until you find me.

I've lived in darkness a long time.

Over the years, my eyes adjusted

until the dark became my world
and I could see.

But then Rudy turned on the light.

He flooded my memory, and now I'm blind.

I don't have much time.

To be more accurate,
my sister doesn't have much time.

He wants me to find him,
but where do I look?

I can't think. It's too bright.

Let me know if the tape's too tight.

There's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

Why are you doing this?

Who am I to spoil the surprise?

Oh, God! Oh, my God!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

I'm just checking the supplies, OK?

Things are moving faster
than I had planned.

- This isn't you.
- Pretty sure it is.

No.

I know there's more. I've seen it.

I never wanted to hurt you.

I know. I know.

Does this make it easier for you?
'Cause I can keep going.

Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

Oh, Jesus Christ!

There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb.

You're not the only one who bought it.

Your name isn't even fucking
Rudy Cooper, is it?

- Nope. But he died for a good cause.
- Yeah, well, so will you.

You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

Not some invisible hooker.
You kidnapped a cop.

It's all part of the plan.

Jesus.

It's hard to believe
it's almost come to fruition.

I mean, this is a lot of years
in the making.

We're only hours away.

He wouldn't have taken Deb

unless he left me everything
a clever monster would need

in order to find them.

Seems I have a new screen saver.

I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded,
but Born Free?

Of course.

Thanks to Rudy, now I know
where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

Born free of all that's human.

That's where I'll find him.

She knows.

She knows. She knows.

She knows. She knows.
She knows. She knows.

She knows. She knows.

All fucking night with that.

She knows.

Listen, we need your help.

Masuka says you were following up a lead

on the ice-truck killer
when you were attacked.

A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

John painted her nails different colors,
but it didn't go nowhere.

Except she was just cut up
by the ice-truck killer.

Holy shit. Monique was a victim?

We're operating on the theory
that he found out you were on his trail.

If we're right, that means
you got stabbed for a reason.

No one knew what I was doing
except Masuka.

Someone else had to know. Think.

I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend,
the prosthetics guy.

But that's crazy, right?

She's been AWOL
since she went to meet him.

She was supposed to come back
and help me canvass,

but she never made it.

That's not like her. Angel, we got to go.

Go. Just go.

There are about 5,000 cargo containers
in the port of Miami.

Finding the one where my mother
was butchered took a bit of magic.

Presto.

Shit.

Just a second!

I told you he was here.

There some reason you're not
answering your damn phone?

Ambien.

What happened here, Dexter?

I couldn't find the remote.

Where's your sister?
She didn't come to work,

and she's not at her apartment.

I honestly don't know, Sergeant.

Dexter, we think her boyfriend
is connected to the ice-truck killer.

We're working on getting
a search warrant to search his home.

Oh, my. No, wow.

Cut the crap.

- You know something. What?
- James.

I saw him last night, skulking in the lab,
ordering secret blood tests.

What kind of tests?

I was looking for a match
on the blood on Batista's collar.

And whose was it?

Rudy's.

Motherfucker.

Knock it off!

He knew all along!

Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.
Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

- It was just a hunch.
- Why didn't you tell us?

I couldn't destroy
Deb's love life on a hunch.

I had to get the facts.

Here are the facts. If he kills her, it's your fault.

What else do you know?

That's it.

He's lying.

Give him a break, James.
It's his sister, all right?

If he knows what's good for her,
he'll stay home

and answer the fucking phone when it rings.

Call if you hear anything.

Hello?

Please don't hang up.

Paul?

The kids don't want to talk to you, OK?

Give them more time.

This isn't about them.
It's about how I was arrested.

Yeah, with a needle in your arm.

I know all about it.

Well, I don't.

I take responsibility for all the shit I pull,

but Rita, I was in the program.

I kicked the hard stuff.

Well, apparently not.

I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.

It's been driving me nuts.

How I got from your house one minute
to the motel room the next,

completely out of my mind on junk.

- It's called a blackout.
- It's called a set-up.

Last thing I remember,

was standing
in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

Maybe he smacked me on the head

and dragged me out of the house,
through the backyard.

You're a piece of work.

I'm telling you,
Dexter is not who you think he is.

Hello?

Make sure it's distributed to everyone, OK?

OK, his name is Rudy Cooper.

Some of you may have met him.
He was dating Officer Morgan.

She was last seen 16 hours ago,

driving to meet him
at the Miami Beach marina.

We need to canvass the entire area.

Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

I've sent a team
to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

The judge just signed off on
the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

Let's tear that place apart.

Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

Your attention, please.

I want to introduce you to
our new lieutenant, EsmÃ© Pascal.

She agreed to put her vacation on hold,

to provide us with much-needed leadership
at this critical time.

Lieutenant, you're on.

I understand we have a new suspect
in the ice-truck killer case.

We're on our way over now
to search his place.

And you are...

Maria LaGuerta.

An officer is missing,
so we need to move fast.

I thought that Sergeant Doakes
was running that investigation.

- He's out following a lead.
- What lead?

He said he'd let me know
if it came to anything.

I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

Who can get me up to speed on the way over?

I can, I guess.

You're driving.

Feel free to join us
when you locate your partner.

Would you like to come with us, Captain?

You seem to have everything under control.

Let's go, people.

It's in there somewhere, my birthplace.

Now what?

No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

With billions spent on homeland security,
it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

So much for the war on terror.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when
every straw is computerized.

Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

I don't like this place.

Something nameless was born here...

Something that lives
in the deepest, darkest hole

of the thing called Dexter.

Get in there!

Somebody else, get in there now!

It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

Nothing will hurt you. I promise.

OK, Deb...

Don't be dead.

Shit.

Surprise, motherfucker.

- Are you following me now?
- You better have a reason for being here.

- I'm looking for my sister.
- In a cargo box?

Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.

You forget you work for the cops?
We love theories.

Spin me a story, asshole.

- What I do on my time is my business.
- Me too, and I'm on my time now.

There's no lieutenant here to save your ass, so
don't fuck with me, Morgan!

All right, you got me.

I ordered some furniture from Thailand.
I was waiting for it to be delivered.

Lab geek my ass.

What the hell's going on?

Security, I need somebody
down here right now.

Miami Metro PD.

Is this guy under arrest?

That's a good question.

You're connected to this.
I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out,

and what I find is gonna stick to you.

Let me out of here, asshole!

Let me out! Let me out!

Let me out, you piece of shit!

Let me out of here, you fucker!

Fuck! Let me out!

Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio,

and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

Don't do it!

Bye!

His happy place,
where he kills more than time.

This is where he'd leave me a clue.

Dexter, better bundle up.

I like the cold.

You know, hypothermia
can easily sneak up on you.

So can hypochondria.

A home like this
would take years to put together.

He must have hated leaving it behind.

What are you looking for?

A clue. A signature or a calling card.

Anything that might give us
a sense of where he went.

I don't think he was
thinking about us when he did this.

I mean, look at this place.

You were right about the victim.
He rushed his work.

He killed that girl to keep us
busy so he could escape,

but he wouldn't go without
leaving a message.

We just need to find it.

Check this out.

This is where he played with his meat.

Pretty whacked out.

I can think of 101 uses for this table.

Know what I mean?

He has my sister, Vince.

Right. I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

Shit.

You're Karen, right?

That's right.

You're in charge of evidence.
This entire room, evidence.

Take photos of every item
in its original position.

Show me the inventory list
when you're done.

Is he in charge?

Guess he is now.

Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

Can I help you?

I guess Paul never mentioned me.

I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

Right.

So, having your sponsor do your dirty work,

which step is that?

He's just concerned for the kids.

No, he's concerned for himself. Excuse me...

I thought he was lying, too,
until I saw the proof.

What proof?

Well, the X-rays the prison
doctor took of Paul's head.

They showed a skull fracture.

Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

No. You didn't.

After you struck him,
the hospital took X-rays, no fracture.

But in prison, a fracture.

If you know Paul,
he'd bash his head against the wall

to get what he wants.

I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.

No, listen, if Paul was attacked,

the way that it happened,
that takes expertise, skill.

No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

Which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

Dexter spends all his time
in a laboratory, for God's sake.

So you've been there?

You seem like a nice man,

but this is none of your goddamn business.

OK. Got it.

We traced the social of Rudy Cooper

to a New Jersey plumber
who mysteriously died in '98.

You got to be kidding.

We still don't have an ID on this guy?

Rudy isn't his real name?

- You trying to be smart?
- Not trying, no.

If you know his name...

Whatever it is going on
between you two, it ends now.

What did you find in there?

Other than the obvious,
a lot of trace bloodstains.

It's probably where he killed them all.

I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment.

Yeah, OK.

- You mind if I...
- Be my guest.

It's perfect. Right out in the open.

At least he's consistent.

Was there anything else near this?

Yeah, a fucking doll sitting on top.

"Home sweet home."

Is he taking me back before the blood,
to a place where a boy was born?

Home sweet home, but which home?

Down on the floor, please.

It's kind of foolish, Deb.

I don't usually work this way.

Call it an homage to a fellow
traveler I greatly admire.

Laura Moser.

Addict, dealer.

My mother.

Arrested in '69, again in '71.

Same address listed both times.

1235 Mangrove Drive.

They say home is where the heart is.

Maybe this is where I left mine.

Surprise.

What are you doing here?

White-chocolate mocha. Your favorite.

I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

I've never even been here before.
I'd love a tour sometime.

Sometime that's not now.

Dexter, what's going on?

It's Deb, OK? She's in trouble.

God. Is it serious?

Yeah, actually, it's very serious,

but I just can't worry
about you, too, right now.

She knows.

The notorious ice-truck killer,

whose been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

Authorities say their big break came
when they found a video of his latest victim.

If she knows, you yapping
about it ain't gonna change it.

The suspect is operating
under an alias, "Rudy Cooper."

We didn't have his fingerprints
in our database,

so his identity is still unclear to us.

She knows.

So sorry, Mr. Batista.

We had to take the psych
overflow from County,

but this one's harmless.

Don't be so sure.

We never take the violent ones.

They have the arsonists, the rapists,

the psycho killers over there.

I tell you, those people belong in prison.

Do they fingerprint
psych patients at County?

Yes, of course.

Half of them don't know their own names.

Got to ID them somehow.

That should take care of him.
Enjoy the peace and quiet.

ID Tech.

It's Batista. Can you do me a favor?

I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints

against psych, mental, and institution records.

Where are you, you silly little bear?

I'm going to find you!

Where can you be?

You silly little goose.

I'm gonna find you!

You silly bear. Where is my baby?

Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

- Where's my Dexter?
- Here!

Oh, my goodness, yes!

You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

Bynie's right there.

Hey, Bynie.

You weren't supposed to tell her.

You remember now?

Bynie.

You always had trouble saying Brian.

I have a brother.

A real brother.

None of this foster bullshit.

We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

Watching mom die,

it's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

The chainsaw, the flying body parts,

the blood.

You were there, too.

Two days sitting in blood
before they found us,

but you were young enough to block it out.

I've never forgotten the day that we were...

Born.

Exactly.

Where's Deb?

I waited for you before we got started.

- Debra!
- She's not in here.

This is not the way
I envisioned our family reunion.

Come on, let's just sit down
and have a beer.

That was the best wipeout.

You didn't even cry.

Next time you try my skateboard,
bend your knees, OK?

Hi.

Hi.

Look out!

I didn't want to do it this way.

OK, let's run his description
against Interpol's fugitive list,

in case he isn't American.

Rudy Cooper? His real name is Brian Moser.

What the hell are you doing here?

I got a hit on his prints

from a Tampa mental hospital
where he grew up.

He was institutionalized for
antisocial personality disorder.

At 21, they said he was cured.
They released him.

Run the name Brian Moser
for credit cards, bank accounts,

anything that might tell us
where he's got Morgan.

We've triangulated
Officer Morgan's cellphone.

Last known location,
20 miles off the coast,

which means he's got her on a boat.

We have his real name.
We're digging into his records.

His name's not gonna help us
find him in open water.

Coordinated search with the coast guard.

- Waste of time.
- Chain of command.

Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

That signal died last night.

By now, he has most likely taken
her to his final location.

Noted.

Let's get busy, people.

Flyovers look good to the press,
but they won't find Morgan.

You think the press matters to me?

It matters to Captain Matthews,
and he calls the shots.

I know you need to define yourself here

and putting me in my place
is one way to do that,

but one of our own is missing,

and we shouldn't waste our time
pissing on trees.

I agree.

I can also see why you were reassigned,

and it has nothing to do
with incompetence

and everything to do with
the Captain trying to save his job.

OK.

Now, I was hired with the directive
to not make your life easy.

So you're gonna ignore the lead?

You don't know me very well,

but luckily for Officer Morgan,
neither does the Captain.

Nothing personal.

I just wanted to have a beer
with you before we got started.

You made that kind of difficult.

Sorry.

You don't ever have
to apologize to me, Dexter.

Not for who you are or anything you do.

Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

Who does it belong to?

Me.

I got it for you, actually.

I'm really more an apartment person.

You're trapped in a lie, little brother,

the same lie they tried forcing me into.

They?

You know...

Doctors, therapists, group leaders.

What a family they were.

You were never put up for adoption.

Afraid not.

You were three, a little bird with a broken wing.

First cop on the scene, Harry Morgan.

He wanted to make you all better.

But me... I could see it in his eyes.

All he saw was a fucked-up kid.

They all did.

So they locked me up.

I didn't even know you existed.

Of course you didn't.

Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

And while you were being raised
by the Morgan family,

I only had the memory of a family.

Me.

Mom always told me to look after you.

Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down

and found out you were exactly like me.

I don't have to imagine.

I know what you've been going
through all these years.

The isolation, the otherness,

a hunger that's never satisfied.

Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

You can be yourself with me.

Your real, genuine self.

Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

I think we're ready for Debra.

I've prepared her just the way you like.

This time, we'll do it together.

Does it have to be Deb?

It's the only way.

But she's my...

Fake sister. I know.

Tell me something...

Your victims, are they all killers?

Yes.

Harry teach you that?

He taught me a code...

to survive.

Like an absurd avenger?

That's not why I kill.

You can be yourself around me.

Who am I?

A killer...

without reason or regret.

You're free.

You can be that way, too.

What about the code?

You don't have a code.

Harry did.

And he's been dead ten years.

You can't keep him sitting
on your shoulder like Jiminy fucking Cricket.

You need to embrace who you are now.

I don't know who I am.

Of course you don't.

You've been away from
your family since you were three,

but I'm here now. I can help you.

We can take this journey together.

I can't.

Not Deb.

Don't say that.

I'm very...

fond of her.

You can't be a killer and a hero.

It doesn't work that way!

Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

Fuck.

In the garage!

Through that door!

It's locked. Fuck! Cover this door!

Cover the door!

Come on. Stay with me.

Shit.

Maria, stay on the door.

He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

Cover me, man.

Get in.

Shit.

Chopper 1 to command,

we're broadening the search
to a five-mile radius.

Any headache, dizziness?

I'm fine. I just want to go home.

I'm afraid we have to take you
you to the hospital.

Standard procedure.

You're saying Rudy called you?

Why would he do that?

Maybe he wanted me to try to talk him down.

He was having second
thoughts about killing Deb.

He seemed to feel like we have
some kind of connection.

He's not the only one.

He said he'd kill Deb
if I didn't show up alone.

Well, you almost fucking got her killed.

I'm gonna request an immediate
suspension when we get back.

You're gonna what?

Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

Are you questioning Dexter?

Back the fuck off my brother!

He just saved my life! He's a fucking hero!

Want each of you to treat him
that way, God damn it!

Way to go, Deb.

I thought you were gonna burst
a frontal lobe out there.

Assholes.

Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

Get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

Relax.

Here.

He's still out there.

Yeah.

And he didn't get what he wanted.

No.

Think he'll try it again?

Maybe.

I'll talk to Captain Matthews

about getting us an officer stationed
outside your hospital room.

No, I'm not staying in a fucking hospital.

There's nothing fucking wrong with me.

Well, you're not staying at home.

Well, I'll just crash with you.

Let's just wait and see what
the doctor says, all right?

Yeah.

Why me, Dex?

Why'd he choose me?

You're just lucky, I guess.

I was so scared. I was so scared.

- I know.
- Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you.

Dad would be so proud.

It's me.

Paul, this is harassment.

Just tell me if he's acting weird.

Who?

Dexter. He hasn't been
himself lately, has he?

How could he be, after what he did to me?

That's it. I'm done.

Call again and you can forget
about ever seeing the kids.

I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

Fine, if that's what it takes
for you to listen to me.

- I want to know that they're safe.
- Why are you doing this?

You want me to be
miserable and alone like you?

All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

A shoe?

Could be in the kitchen or in the backyard.
It's missing.

I checked, and it wasn't in
the items that they got when I was arrested.

Why would it be here?

I was trying to figure out
why my ankle was so bruised.

Now I'm thinking it got banged
when he dragged me out,

when my shoe was knocked off.

Good night, Paul.

Night.

Screw you.

What did I just do?

I drove away a brother
who accepts me, sees me,

for an adopted sister
who'd reject me if she knew

and a foster father who betrayed me.

That's what it was, a betrayal.

The most important single fact about me.

I'm not alone. And Harry kept it from me.

What do I really owe him after that?

Mr. Morgan?

- Mr. Morgan?
- That's me.

Your sister has some bruises,
but no major injuries.

Still, you should keep an eye on her.

I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

But she's OK, right?

She can go home with you tonight,

or we can keep her here at the hospital.

It's your choice.

Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

We aim to please here at Chez Dex.

I'll be sleeping on the couch
with a spring in my side

just to make sure
you're safe tonight, but...

we're gonna have to talk
tomorrow about a long-term plan,

after you get a good night's sleep.

Good night, sister.

I stopped by your prosthetics lab

after I left Deb at the hospital.

Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

Sweet dreams, Bynie.

Hey.

You weren't supposed to wake up.

I guess not.

Sorry.

Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

Sterling.

I keep it for special occasions.

Which you are.

I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

It's a service I don't usually offer.

What am I, one of your victims now?

You going to collect a sample
of Bynie's blood for your collection?

No, you're not a trophy...

but you need to be put down.

Why? Because of your code?

And the safety of my sister.

She's not your real sister.

She's a stranger to you,
and she'll always be one.

I tried to help you by killing her.

I know that!

You should know this isn't easy for me.

You've done more to deserve
my knife than anyone.

You're the only one
I ever wanted to set free.

You're the one that needs
setting free, little brother.

Your life is a lie.

You'll never be what you...

Sorry.

I can't hear any more...

'cause you're right.

How did you know he was here?

A neighbor saw the door open.

We got his fingerprints on
the knife, a note on the fridge,

and a single incised wound to the neck.

Slight upward angle.

Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

Looks like a clear suicide.

He does himself the same way
he did the hookers. Poetic.

Retarded. Look at him. He's dead.

The ice-truck killer always flaunted
his kills as if he was untouchable.

By taking his own life,

he's preventing us from ever catching him.

I don't care why he did it.
I'm just glad he did.

Decaf mochaccino, non-fat, no whip.
Your favorite.

I got your message.

How's Debra?

She has all her limbs.

Thank God she's alive.

That poor thing must be a mess.

Falling for a serial killer.

What are the odds?

- What about you?
- What about me?

Are you all right?

Yeah.

No.

I've been through a lot lately.

I could use a little more time
with you and the kids.

We could, too.

I'm sorry I've been so...

Next time, could you just
let me know what's going on?

When you didn't return my calls,

I started to get a little paranoid.

I can be better about that.

Good.

Who knows?

You might even find I can handle the truth.

I wish that was the case.

The reality is, there's nobody left alive
who can handle my truth.

Doakes always sensed
I was hiding something.

Now he knows.

My devil danced with his demon,
and the fiddler's tune isn't over.

I wonder what it would be like
for everything inside me

that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

But I'll never know.

I live my life in hiding.

My survival depends on it.

Dearly damaged Debra,

she's here to face what's left of the monster,

spit on his carcass, mourn him.

She's in hiding now, too.

Harry's daughter won't let anyone see
what she's suffering inside.

That's her tragedy.

My tragedy is that I killed
the one person I didn't have to hide from.

And I'm the only one who mourns him.

Everyone would probably thank me

if they knew I was the one
who drained him of his life.

Good job. You sliced him up good.

In fact, I'm sure
they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

Way to take out the trash. Thanks, man.

All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

This is what it must feel like
to walk in full sunlight,

my darkness revealed,

my shadow self embraced.

Yeah, they see me.

I'm one of them...

In their darkest dreams
