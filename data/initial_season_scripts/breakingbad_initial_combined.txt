My name is
Walter Hartwell White.

I live at
308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

Albuquerque, New Mexico,
87104.

To all law enforcement entitles,
this is not an admission of guilt.

I am speaking
to my family now.

Skyler...

you are the love
of my life.

I hope you know that.

Walter, Junior...

you're my big man.

There are...




There are going
to be some...

things... things...

that you'll come to learn
about me in the next few days.

I just want you to know

that no... no matter
how it may look,

I only had you in my heart.

Good-bye.

Happy Birthday.

Look at that.

That is veggie bacon.

Believe it or not.
Zero cholesterol.

You won't even taste
the difference.

What time do you think
you'll be home?




Same time.

I don't want him dicking
you around tonight.

You get paid till 5,
you work till 5, no later.

Hey.

- Happy Birthday.
- Well, thank you.

You're late... again.

There was no
hot water... again.

I have an easy fix
for that.

You wake up early,

and then you get to be
the first person in the shower.

I have an idea.

How about buy
a new hot water heater?

How's that idea?

For the millionth
and billionth time.

- Did you take your Echinacea?
- Yeah.

I think it's getting better.

What the hell is this?

It's veggie bacon.
We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.

Not me.
I want real bacon.

Not this fake crap.

Too bad.

Eat it.

This smells
like Band-aids.

Eat... it.

So, how's it feel
to be old?

How does it feel
to be a smart ass?

Good.

Eat your veggie bacon.

- You all set?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

- All right, see you at home.
- Okay, see you.

Chemistry.

It is the study of what?

Anyone?

Ben.

- Chemicals.
- Chemicals!

No!

Chemistry is...

Well, technically,

chemistry is
the study of matter.

But I prefer to see it
as the study of change.

Now just...
just think about this.

Electrons.

They...

change their energy levels.

Molecules.

Molecules change
their bonds.

Elements.

They combine
and change into compounds.

Well, that's...
that's all of life.

Right? I mean, it's just...
It's the constant.

It's the cycle.
It's solution,

dissolution, just over
and over and over.

It is growth, then decay,
then transformation.

It is fascinating, really.

Chad...

Is there something
wrong with your table?

Okay.
Ionic bonds...

Are you done?

Ionic bonds.

Chapter 6.

And 2, 3 makes 10,
and 10 makes 20.

Here's your receipt,

and hand this claiming disc
to your car wash professional.

Thank you.
Come again.

He's not coming.

He said he quits.

I'm gonna run
the register.

Bogdan, no.
We talked about this.

I'm shorthanded, Walter.

What am I to do?

Walter?

What am I to do?

Hey, Mr. White!

Make those tires
shine, huh?

Oh, my God.

You would not believe
who's cleaning Chad's car.

Mr. White...

from Chemistry.

Surprise!

Happy Birthday, Dad!

You're so very late.

Really, I'm serious,
Skyler.

I mean, you're flat
as a washboard.

You look awesome.

She's not showing
at all, is she?

She's showing
a little.

Carmen, this is
my sister Marie.

- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

Glock 22.
It's my daily carry, okay?

I mean, unless you're talking,
what, plus, B-plus loads,

you can forget
the 9-mil, all right?

I seen one of those
bounce off a windshield one time.

Yeah, the way you shoot.

If you're gonna
bring a gun,

you gotta bring
enough gun.

.40 caliber.

- This is awesome right here.
- Nice, isn't it?

Dad, come check
this out.

- Yeah, I see it.
- Come on, take it.

Check it out, Walt.

No, no,
it's just heavy.

That's why they hire men.

It's not gonna
bite you, all right?

Looks like Keith Richards
with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he?

Hey, Walt. Everybody listen up,
listen up, listen up!

I'm gonna give a toast.

A little toast to my brother-in-law.
Come here.

Walt, you got a brain
the size of Wisconsin,

but we're not gonna
hold that against you.

Because your heart's
in the right place, man.

Your heart's
in the right place.

We love you, man.
We love you.

Everybody!
To Walt!

Na zdorovje!

Na zdorovje!

Hey,
turn on Channel 3.

At which point we apprehended
three individuals

and placed them into custody.

I'm proud to say
the outstanding

professionalism
of my fellow agents

at the Albuquerque
District Office

resulted in
a substantial amount

of methamphetamine
being taken off the streets.

Were any shots fired?

No, ma'am. Our agents took
the suspects by surprise.

Damn, the TV does
add ten pounds.

Ten pounds?

Hey, sit and spin.
Both of you.

- Hank.
- What?

Sorry.
You didn't see that.

So charming.

This is clearly
an ongoing operation,

one which was
well organized...

Hank, how much
money is that?

It's about 700 grand.
That's a pretty good haul, huh?

As I say, it's a good day
for the citizens of Albuquerque

when we can put this big a dent
in the local drug trade.

But that's unusual,
isn't it, that kind of cash?

Well, it's not the most
we ever took.

It's easy money...

until we catch you.

Walt, just say the word
and I'll take you on a ride-along.

You can watch us
knock down a meth lab.

Get a little excitement
in your life.

Well, someday.

Which one's this?

That faux-Lalique vase

I picked up
at the Super-Swap.

How's it doing?

I met my reserve,

and there's still
two minutes.

What's up?

You tell me,
birthday boy.

Oh, hey, so what's up
for Saturday?

Car wash.

Bogdan says
he needs me.

Until what time?
Noon? 1-ish?

Probably 2,
more like it.

And then what
after that?

Actually...

I was thinking
of driving

up to Los Alamos.

The visitor center
has an exhibit on...

It's really supposed
to be...

- You're not gonna paint?
- I'll paint.

It's just that this...

part of this exhibition on the...

Mars Rover
photographs are...

The detail really is just
supposed to be amazing.

It's just that I really need you
to paint at some point.

I mean, the sooner that
back bedroom gets finished.

And I'd do it myself, except
you said you don't want me

- standing on the stepladder.
- I'll paint. I will paint.

What is going on
down there?

- No, it's just...
- Is he asleep?

No, It's nothing.
You know, just...

You know,

we gotta be careful
about the baby.

Don't worry about the baby.
This is just for you.

We are just
doing you tonight.

So just close your eyes.

Relax, and let it...

- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

There you go.

That's it.

That's it.

There you go.

Keep it going.

Keep it going.

Keep it going.

Keep... Yes!

56!

This is so embarrassing.

I am fine. Honestly.

It's just some bug
going around.

First my wife had it,
then my son, and now me.

It's just like
a chest cold.

Could be some
low blood sugar as well.

I didn't have the greatest
breakfast this morning, honestly.

Hey, listen, can you do me a favor?
Can you just...

drop me off
at a corner somewhere?

No. Sorry.

It's just that I don't have
the greatest insurance.

Take a couple
of deep breaths for me.

Is there anybody you want us
to contact for you?

God, no.

Lean forward for me,
would you?

Mr. White,
are you a smoker?

No. Never.

Why do you ask?

Mr. White.

Mr. White?

Yes.

You understood what
I've just said to you?

Yes.

Lung cancer.
Inoperable.

I'm sorry...

I just need to make sure
you fully understand.

Best-case scenario,
with chemo,

I'll live maybe
another couple years.

It's just...

you've got mustard
on your...

Right there.
Mustard, there.

Right there.

So my records show
that I paid it,

and I certainly don't
feel that we owe any late...

All right.

Well, I'll check
with the bank

and maybe the post office,

if they lost it or something.

Yeah, let me look
into that.

Okay.

Thank you.

Did you use
the MasterCard last month?

15.88 at Staples?

We needed printer paper.

Walt, the MasterCard's
the one we don't use.

Okay.

So how was your day?

Oh, I don't know.

I don't know.
It was, um...

It was fine.

Come on. I'm shorthanded.
I need you to do some wipe-downs.

- Come on.
- What?

I said I need you outside
to do some wipe-downs.

Are you here to work
or to be staring at the skies?

Come on, let's go.

Come on, man.

- Fuck you, Bogdan.
- What?

I said fuck you!

And your eyebrows!

Wipe down this!

Uh, Hank.

Hank, it's Walt.
Hey.

Oh, listen...
I didn't wake you, did I?

Oh, good, good.

No, no, nothing's wrong.
I just, uh...

I've been, uh, thinking
about that offer...

that ride-along.

It's the last house
on the right. See it?

Not the two-story one.
The one next to it.

The kind of... I don't know,
what do you call that?

- Green?
- Sage.

Sage.

What, do you work at
the fucking Pottery Barn?

Sage.
That's the word for it.

My fault the only word
your dumb ass knows is green?

Cheese dick.

I know that one.
How 'bout that?

Anyway, it's the sage one.
See it?

So what tells you
it's a meth lab?

Star snitch says
some dude

goes by Cap'n Cook
lives up to his name in there.

Says he always adds
a dash of chili powder.

Ah, you exuberant
Mexicans.

Captain Cook,
that's a white boy's name.

Dopey as hell, too.

Yeah?
Tell you what.

I got 20 bucks that
says he's a beaner.

- All right.
- You're on.

All right,
come on, come on.

All right. School bus is clear.
Got the green light.

Copy that.

Watch this.
This makes 'em shit.

Go, go, go.

Meth labs are nasty
on a good day.

You mix that wrong,
you got mustard gas.

Phosphine gas.

I think.

Yeah, exactly.

One whiff will kill you.
That's why the respirators.

House is clear.
One suspect in custody.

Copy that.

The suspect, might he be
of the Latino persuasion?

Driver's license says
Emilio Koyama.

Asian!

Pay up, sucker.

First name Emilio.

That's at least half
a beaner.

Tell you what,
I'll let you off for a 10.

Cheer up, Gomey.
You people still got J. Lo.

Hank, do you think
I might get to go inside?

See the actual lab?

Yeah. Yeah,
I tell you what,

we're gonna go
peek our heads in,

check it out first.

Stay here a minute.

God.

Oh, my God.

Pinkman?

It's me.

I'm alone.

How'd you find me?

You're still
in our filing system.

So your aunt
owns this place, right?

I own it.

No one's looking for you.

Why are you here?

I was curious.

Honestly,
I never expected you

to amount to much,
but methamphetamine?

I didn't picture that.

There's a lot of money
in it, huh?

I don't know what
you're talking about.

- No?
- Not a clue.

Cap'n Cook?

That's not you?

Like I said,
no one is looking for you.

Look, I don't know what you think
you're doing here, Mr. White.

I mean, if you're planning
on giving me some bowl winder

about getting right with Jesus
by turning myself in...

- Not really.
- High school was a long time ago.

You ain't Welcome Back Kotter,
so step off.

No speeches.

Short speech.

You lost your partner today.
What's his name?

Emilio?

Emilio is going to prison.

The DEA took all your money,
your lab.

You got nothing.

Square 1.

But you know
the business.

And I know the chemistry.

I'm thinking...

maybe you and I
could partner up.

You want to cook crystal meth?

You?

You and, uh... and me?

That's right.

Either that...

or I turn you in.

What the hell is this?

Damned if I know.

I described it
as mosaic folk art.

- Somebody bought it?
- Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.

$14.00 plus shipping.

Yes!

At this rate, in 50 or 60 years,
you'll be rich.

So how goes the novel?

It's not a novel,
actually, which I have...

You're not writing a novel?
You told me you were.

No. Short stories.

I said that if eventually
I have enough good ones

that maybe I'll try and...

publish another collection.

Those really didn't sell.

I just thought a novel
would be easier to sell.

Yeah, well, maybe so.

Ever want me to read anything,
I could critique it for you.

No.

I mean, I'm not at
that stage where I...

No.

Open offer.

So what's up
with Walt lately?

What do you mean?
He's fine.

He just seems,
I don't know...

quieter than usual.

Turning 50
is a big deal.

I mean, I'm sure as hell
not looking forward to 40.

You're gonna be
a complete basket case.

So it's mid-life crisis.

No, he's just quiet.

- How's the sex?
- Marie, Jesus.

Guess that answers that.

You just gonna sit there?

This.
Look at this.

Kjeldahl-style
recovery flask,

800 milliliters.
Very rare.

You got your usual
paraphernalia:

Griffin beakers,
your Erlenmeyer flask.

But the pi?ce de r?sistance:

a round bottom boiling flask.
5,000 milliliters.

Well, I cook in one of those.

The big one.

One of these?

No, this is a volumetric flask.
You wouldn't cook in one of these.

Yeah, I do.

No, you don't.

A volumetric flask is
for general mixing and titration.

You wouldn't apply heat
to a volumetric flask.

That's what
a boiling flask is for.

Did you learn nothing
from my chemistry class?

No. You flunked me.

- Remember?
- No wonder.

Prick.

Now let me tell you something else.
This ain't chemistry,

this is art.

Cooking is art.

And the shit I cook is the bomb,
so don't be telling me.

The shit you cook is shit.

I saw your setup.
Ridiculous.

You and I
will not make garbage.

We will produce
a chemically pure

and stable product
that performs as advertised.

No adulterants. No baby formula.
No chili powder.

No, no, chili P
is my signature.

Not anymore.

Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

- What the hell is this?
- Lab safety equipment.

We're also gonna have
an emergency eye wash station.

These chemicals
and their fumes are toxic,

in case you didn't know that.

Well, you can dress up
like a faggot if you want.

Not me.

Listen, this stuff doesn't
stay more than a day.

What? I thought
we were gonna cook here.

No, we're not
gonna cook here.

Okay, this is my house.
I don't shit where I eat.

Well, then, where
are we gonna work?

You tell me.

This is your deal.

You want to smoke it up,
smoke it up at your house.

Nah, I didn't think so.

Oh, well.

Well...

what if we rented one
of those self-storage places,

you know, those little orange garages,
worked out of there?

No.

They're on to that.
They got dogs that sniff around.

RV. That's what you want.

What, like a Winnebago?

Yeah.

I know a dude
who wants to sell his.

He just goes camping with it.

But a mobile meth lab?

That'd be the bomb.
I mean,

drive way out
in the boonies.

Be all evasive.

Dude, this isn't even 7 grand.
My guy wants 85.

This is all the money
I have in the world.

You're a drug dealer.
Negotiate.

You are not how
I remember you from class,

I mean, like, not at all.

- I gotta go.
- Wait, wait. Hold on.

Tell me why
you're doing this.

Seriously.

Why do you do it?

Money, mainly.

- There you go.
- Nah, come on!

Man, some straight like you,
giant stick up his ass,

all of a sudden
at age, what, 60,

he's just gonna break bad?

- I'm 50.
- It's weird is all, okay?

It doesn't compute.
Listen...

if you've gone crazy
or something...

I mean, if you've...
if you've gone crazy

or depressed,
I'm just saying...

that's something
I need to know about.

Okay?
I mean, that affects me.

I am awake.

What?

Buy the RV.

We start tomorrow.

How's it coming
in there?

Fine.

Do you want me
or your dad?

Dad.

So how are those feeling in the waist?
Are they too tight?

'Cause you don't want to get 'em
if they're too tight.

They're pre-shrunk.

Are you sure you don't want
to get a different kind.

Like, you know,
the skinny jeans?

Those are really supposed
to be in style now.

The skaters wear them.

Do I look like a skater?

All right.

Mom, look at
my big-boy pants.

Mommy, could you
zip up my big-boy pants?

- Don't.
- What?

Don't.

Walt.

- Where...
- I have no idea.

You know what?
Don't even look at them.

They're obviously
very stupid.

Yep.

I think that, um...

I think those jeans
look really good on you.

You should get 'em
if you like 'em, okay?

Why don't you just hang out
here for a second?

I'll be right back.

Fine.

Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf
in my brand-new big-boy pants.

- What are you doing?
- What's wrong, chief?

Having a little trouble
walking?

Get off me.
Get off me!

I'll mess you up, man.

Well, you'll have one shot.
You better make it good.

What, are you waiting
for your girlfriends?

You better go. Take it.

Take your shot.
Take it!

Come on. Come on.

- Come on, let's get outta here.
- Let's go.

Psycho.

Yeah,
nothing but cows!

Got some big cow house
way out that way, like 2 miles,

but I don't see nobody.

Cow house?

Yeah, where they live.

The cows.

Whatever, man.

Yeah, let's cook here.

Cow house.

God help me.

What are you doing?

These are my good clothes.

I can't go home smelling
like a meth lab.

Yeah, you can.
I do.

Those?

Those, uh...
You're keeping those on, right?

Come on.

Daylight's burning.

Oh, my God.

Oh, this is, uh...
this is a good look for you.

And you're maybe only the world's
second biggest homo.

Would you shut up
and help me?

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah, work it.

Baby, work it.

Turn that off!

This is glass grade.

I mean, you got...

Jesus, you got crystals in here
2 inches, 3 inches long.

This is pure glass.

You're a damn artist.

This is art,
Mr. White.

Actually, it's just
basic chemistry,

but thank you, Jesse.
I'm glad it's acceptable.

Acceptable?
You're the goddamn Iron Chef.

Every jibbhead from here to Timbuktu
is going to want a taste.

Now I gotta...
I gotta try this.

No. No.

No, we only sell it.
We don't use it.

Okay, since when?

Listen, you've been watching
way too much Miami Vice.

That ain't happening.

So... what now?

How do we proceed?

We cook more tomorrow.

Meantime...

I know just the guy to talk to.

Kraze, how you doing,
my man?

You got a new dog.
Right on, man.

What's his name?

Yeah, I had
a dog like that once,

except maybe,
like, twice as big.

Super purebred.

Now, me personally, I would train him
to go straight for the nuts...

Just shut your mouth
and show me your money.

I ain't buying, ese.

I'm selling.

Tell me that ain't
the finest scante

you ever laid eyes on.

Go ahead, try it.

Hey, poochie.

How you doing?

Jesus Christ.

See? What'd I say?

- It's all right.
- It's all right? It's all right?

- Yeah, it's all right.
- So, what? You back in business?

Hell, yeah, I'm back.

With a vengeance.

Vato loco gotta make a living.

You know, with your cousin
gone away and all.

And listen, homes,
about that.

It really broke me up
about Emilio.

That dude
is like my brother.

He okay?
You talk to him?

Yeah, yeah,
I talked to him.

He said when the Feds came,
you were out

sticking it
in some neighbor lady.

Hey, you know,
I got lucky twice.

I don't know, man.

Emilio...

He thinks maybe
you dimed on him.

That is bullshit.

That is bullshit,
Krazy-8!

I should kick his punk ass
for even thinking that.

You know what?
Next time you talk to Emilio,

you tell him for me,
all right?

Why don't you
tell him yourself?

- Made bail this morning.
- Go ahead, pendejo.

Kick my ass.

Hey, listen...

Where did you get this?

Because I know your little
punk ass didn't cook it.

Hey, man.

You some kind of nudist?

That's some stone-fine tick tick
you been cooking there, ese.

How about you come
work for me?

I'd be willing
to sell it to you if...

the price is right.

You out here
all by yourself, huh?

I know you.

He was there when I got busted.
He's with the DEA!

No.

You ratasnitch
motherfucker!

Run, Mr. White! Run!

I say we cap 'em both.

Hey, you really
cook up that batch?

Yeah.

You an artist.

It's a damn shame.

Wait! Wait a minute.

Listen to me.

I'll teach you my recipe.

What do you say?
You want to cook like me?

You let us both live...

and I will teach you.

Put the cigarette out.

Please.

Move it, homes.

We ain't got all day.

Okay.

What happened?

What'd you
do to them?

Red phosphorus
in the presence of moisture

and accelerated by heat
yields phosphorus hydride.

Phosphine gas.

One good whiff and...

We gotta...

We gotta... clean this up.

Where were you?

Walt.

I don't know what's been going on
with you lately, but...

Nothing.
I'm fine.

Whatever it is...

I'll tell you this.

I do not like it
when you don't talk to me.

The worst thing
you can do is shut me out.

Walter, is that you?

[♪♪♪]

Let's get something straight.

This, the chemistry, is my realm.

I am in charge
of the cooking.

Out there on the street,
you deal with that.

[ALARM WAILING]

As far as our customers go, I don't
want to know anything about them.

I don't wanna see them,
I don't wanna hear from them.

I want no interaction with them
whatsoever.

[CHATTERING]

This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.




You got
any issues with that?

Whatever, man.

No matter what happens,

no more bloodshed.

[♪♪♪]

No violence.

[♪♪♪]

Walt?
Mm.

You all right?
Oh, yeah.

Yeah, I'm okay.

You know, honey, you...
You really don't have to...

Look, I like being here with you.

Yeah.

I'm only saying that,
you know, I'd be okay,




that really, if you wanna go...

You know, actually, it would
make me feel a little better

knowing that you were there
when Walter Jr. Gets home
from school.

Okay.

All right. So you'll call me
when you're finished?

Oh, yeah.
Okay.

Oh, uh, and have you been
in touch with Elliott?

Because I haven't seen
a check from him.

Yes, l... I got it.

Really?
It came, yeah. And l...

Yeah, it did. It came last week,

and I put it right into
my credit union account.

So I'm taking care of it.

Good.
Yeah.

So we're good. We're good.

Could you not deposit this
until Monday?

Thank you.

Call if the discomfort's too much,
otherwise we'll see you next week.

Yeah.

[♪♪♪]

WALT: Chemical reactions involve
change on two levels:

Matter and energy.

When a reaction is gradual,
the change in energy is slight.

I mean, you don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

For example, when rust collects
on the underside of a car, right?

But if a reaction happens quickly,

otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way

that generates
enormous bursts of energy.

Uh. Uh...

Who can give me an example
of rapid chemical reaction?

Hint, hint. Right here.

Like, an explosion?

Yes, good. Explosions.

Explosions are the result
of chemical reactions

happening almost instantaneously.

And the faster reactants,
i.e. Explosives...

And fulminative mercury
is a prime example of that.

The faster they undergo change,

the more violent the explosion.

Explosions.

Okay, listen, why don't you
start reading on your own

from the top of chapter seven,
all right?

[VOMITING]

MAN:
You okay?

I got it, Mr. White.

Don't worry.

You got kids to teach.

Thanks, Hugo.

[CAR HORN HONKING]

SKYLER:
He's starting to lose weight,

which is tough, to see that.

I can already feel the difference
when I put my arms around him.

Can I talk to...?
Of course.

Walt.

When you don't
let me in,

when you don't tell me
what's going on...

I mean, it's like I feel like you don't
even want me around sometimes.

No.

And recently, these afternoons,

when you're coming home
so late,

and we're just left wondering
where you are.

WALT JR:
Yeah, Dad.

What's up with that?

Walt, is there anything else
you're holding back from
your family?

Now's the time to share.

Well, I, uh...

I like to be alone,
I mean, at times.

And it's not
about you, really.

It's just that sometimes
it feels better

not to talk at all

about anything

to anyone.

Alone time can be helpful,
for some types.

Maybe knowing what you do
when you're alone

might make it easier for your family
to be more accepting

of whatever it is you do alone.

Yeah.

Well,

I like to go on walks

a couple of times a week,
maybe more, after work.

And I really enjoy the nature.

You know, the cacti,

vegetation, that kind of thing.

And it's really very therapeutic.

[♪♪♪]

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

[COUGHING]

Yo, God, are you okay?

Hey, you did that shit?
I'm dizzy. No.

I'm just dizzy. I need air.

God, I feel like I'm burning up.
Sit down, sit down.

I gotta...
Take this off.

Sit down, get some air.

Oh, God.

Here.

Better?
Yeah, that's better.

When were you gonna tell me?

Tell you what?

Cancer.

You got it, right?

How did you know?

My aunt had one of those
dots on her

to target the radiation.
What, is it in your lung?

I'm your partner, man,
you should've told me.

God, that's not cool, okay?
Not at all.

What stage are you?

Three-A.

Gone into your lymph nodes.

Your aunt,

how bad was she
when they caught it?

Bad enough,
she didn't last long.

How long?
Seven months.

God.

I get it now.

That's why you're doing all this.

You want to make
some cash for your people
before you check out.

You got a problem with that?
You tell me.

You're the one that
looks like he just crawled
out of a microwave.

[GROANING]

You gonna be able to
finish the batch?

Yes.

All right.

No.

You do it.

Me?

Yeah.

What happened
to your mad skills?

[SIGHS]

Go on. Here.

You do it.

You can do it.

If you have any questions,
I'll be right out here.

The next time, put an ice pack
on your head during chemo.

My aunt said it helped
with the hair loss.

[♪♪♪]

What's this, Christmas?

This that one we found way out
in the boonies at the cook site?

Holy shit.
What?

HANK: Lab says they pulled up
an imprint of some old writing
used to be on the inside,

Magic Marker or something.
Yeah? What's it say?

"Property of
J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab."

That's Walt's school.

[PAUL ROTHMAN'S
"SCOOBIDOO LOVE" PLAYS]

We were supposed
to start at 3.

Hey, I'm out there making
fat stacks, man. Chill.

Hey, prepaid cell phone. Use it.

How much is this?
Twenty-six big ones.

Is that all?
Twenty-six thousand dollars?

No, that's 2600,
and your share is 13,

minus 25 bucks
for that phone.

How much meth did you sell?
Nearly an ounce.

Last time I checked,

there were 16 ounces
to a pound. What did you do
with the rest, smoke it?

Yo, I've been out there
all night slinging crystal.

You think it's cake
moving a pound of meth
one teenth at a time?

So why are you selling it
in such small quantities?

Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

To who?
What do I look like, Scarface?

This is unacceptable.
I am breaking the law here.

This return is too little
for the risk.

I thought you'd be ready
for another pound today.

You may know a lot
about chemistry, man,

but you don't know jack
about slinging dope.

Well, I'll tell you,
I know a lack of
motivation when I see it.

Oh, my...

Come on, you've gotta be more
imaginative, you know, just...

Just think
outside the box here.

We have to move our product
in bulk, wholesale.

Now, how do
we do that?

What do you mean,
to, like, a distributor?

Yes. Yes, that's what we need.

We need a distributor.
Now, do you know anyone like that?

Yeah, I mean, I used to,
until you killed him.

So who took Krazy-8's place?

Some guy named Tuco.

Badass, from what I hear.

Tuco, okay.
So then just go talk to Tuco.

Right. Like, "Hello, sir.
Hey, I know you don't know me,

but would you be interested
in a felony quantity
of methamphetamine?"

Well, yes, but maybe with
a little more salesmanship,
perhaps?

You just don't get it, man.
Okay? This guy's OG.

What... What does that mean?
Jesus, look, he's off our level, man.

He's not gonna do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

You just don't understand
the way it works.

You can't just bum-rush
some high-level ice man

and start cutting deals.

Okay? It's risky. You need an intro,
you need someone to vouch.

Well, who introduced you
to Krazy-8?

Emilio, and that's only because
I knew him from, like, third grade.

And we can't talk to Emilio
either, because...

All right, all right, all right.

Look, I'm telling you,
Mr. White, it's too risky. Okay?

I mean, we're making money.
Why can't you just be satisfied

with the way it is?
Oh, come on! Jesus!

Just grow
some fucking balls!

Wow.

[MONITOR BEEPING]

Wait till Monday again?
Yes, please. Thank you.

[VOMITING]

Oh, God.

[TOILET FLUSHES]

Mr. White.

Thank you, Hugo.

[GROANS]

[COUGHING]

Knock, knock.
Oh, hey.

How you feeling, Walt?
Good. Yeah.

Are you up for having a visitor?

Hey, buddy.
Hank.

Well, let me know
if you need anything, huh?

I will. Thank you, Carmen.
No problem.

Damn.

Chick's got an ass like an onion,
makes me wanna cry.

So, what...?
What are you doing here?

Well, I had some questions
I wanted to run by you, work-related.

You feeling okay?
I can come back later.

No, no, no, I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

What do you mean,
"work-related," though?

Do you recognize that?

No. No.

Well, that was used to cook meth.

Found it out on some Indian land
about 40 miles from here.

Old label on the inside used to say:

"J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab."
Really?

I don't understand
how that came from here.

Well, I was hoping
you could help me with that.

We found it near an abandoned car
that belonged to one of our snitches.

A snitch?

Yeah, one of our
confidential informants.

Went missing a while back.

No body yet,
but we're pretty sure, you know:

[CLICKS TONGUE]

Probably chopped up
into little pieces and
fed to the buzzards.

Anyway, you...

Any respirators like that
go missing lately?

No. No.

No, I mean,
not that I know of.

I'll need to look at that inventory.
Sure.

Sure. I've got a list
hanging on the wall.

Do you mind if I take a look
at your storeroom?

Not at all. No.

Be my guest.

All right, so who's got keys?

The science faculty,
the staff, Carmen,

the vice-principal
has the master, and me.

How about students?

No, no. No students have keys.

Shit, I should hope not.
My question is,

do any of the little pissants
know where you keep them?

Uh... I don't...
I don't think so, no.

I mean, besides,
I keep them right here
in my pocket anyway, so...

Walt, look,
I know they're your students,

but do not underestimate them.
Big mistake.

Are there any other respirators?
Um, no.

Because I'm counting six,
inventory says eight.

[PHONE RINGING]

Hm.

Glassware looking a little sparse.
Is it?

Yeah. You're missing a couple of
Erlenmeyer flasks, at least.

Oh, yeah.

A five-thousand milliliter
round-bottom.

Meth heads love
to brew in this baby.

[PHONE RINGING]

You gonna answer that?
Oh, no, it's just... No, I don't...

Maybe it's Skyler
and she's in trouble
or something.

I mean, shit, don't ignore it
on my account. Answer it.
Come on, I got stuff to do.

Jeez.
Okay.

Hello?
JESSE: Yo, what's up, Mr. W?

Speaking.

Bad time to talk?
Absolutely.

All right, so just listen.

So you know that guy
we were talking about, Tuco?

Turns out my boy, Skinny Pete,
was in the same cell block with him

over at Los Lunas.

So we got our in. We're hauling
a pound to the dude right now.

Okay, then. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much for calling.

My doctor is very solicitous.

Hey, look, buddy. The last thing
I wanna do is get you in hot water.

But some meth-monkey
had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?

You gotta keep better watch
over your turf.

I will.

We don't want people
to start wondering about you, right?

[LAUGHS]

Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.

So you're sure
you're tight with this guy?

Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.

[MUSIC PLAYING OVER STEREO]

Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete.

MAN:
Skinny dick.

Maybe this isn't such
a good idea, yo. Come on.

[DOOR BUZZES]

Yeah, man, that's what's happening.

PETE:
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

No need, man.
Me and Tuco go back.

Tuco, what's happening,
my brother?

Sick crib, yo. You've been keeping
it real since you been sprung.

What's it been, like, a year?
This your boy?

Yeah, Jesse. Dude with the glass
I was telling you about.

Hey, man, yeah.
I've heard a lot about you.

Break out the ice.

Take a bump.
No worries, man, I'm no cop.

I said, hit it.

All right.

[YELLS]

This kicks like a mule
with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

Where'd you get it?
I cooked it.

Bullshit.

Who you working for?

No one, man. I mean,
I have a partner that
I cook with, but that's it.

All right.

We got a deal.

See, I told you Tuco
would hook you up.

Cool. I haven't said how much.

[TUCO MOANING]

All right. How much?

Thirty-five large for the pound.

[SCALE BEEPS]

Well, I mean,
you're a little light, ese.

[LAUGHS]

It's all right, don't sweat it.
It's all good.

It's good. Go on, get out of here.

What about the money?
You'll get it.

This is a consignment operation.

You want me to float
thirty-five G's?

You don't trust me?

Hey, no, no, hey.
It's not that, man.

It's just, you know,
I don't do business that way.

Tough shit, the deal is done.

You said this was cool, okay?
Money for meth, cash up front.

Don't front, dude,
Tuco's good for it.

I don't need your punk ass
to vouch for me.

Come on.

Oh, come on.

All right. You brought me
some really clean crystal. Hoo!

You really want your
money up front?

Up front.

[♪♪♪]

[GRUNTING]

Nobody moves crystal
in the South Valley but me, bitch.

Morning, Hugo.

You don't mind if I call you Hugo,
Hugo?

CARMEN:
We've never had a problem
with Hugo, ever.

Is that Uncle Hank?

Right, what do you got there?
All right. Book him.

Uncle Hank's
arresting Mr. Archilleya.

This doesn't make any sense
to me at all. I don't understand.

HANK:
I got two words for you:
Background check. How about that?

JESSE:
Yo, yo, yo. 1-4-8, 3-to-the-3,
to-the-6, to-the-9.

Representing the ABQ.
What up, beyotch?

Leave it at the tone.

[BEEPS]

Where the hell are you?
Call me back.

SKYLER: Hey, Walt?
Yeah?

Hank's about to deal.
Okay, I'll be right there.

HANK:
All right, let's see
what the turn brings us.

[MUSIC PLAYING
OVER STEREO]

You're looking good, Walt.
Your color's better.

Yeah? Thanks.

He's actually on
the pretty strong stuff now.

Dr. Delcavoli's trying
to talk him into taking
some time off from work, but...

Well, actually,
I just talked to
Carmen this morning,

and they're getting a substitute
for a few weeks.

Oh.
Good for you.

I just didn't
have a chance to tell you. Sorry.

Your bet, tough guy.

Check.

Yeah, check.

Check's in the mail.

Ten million.
That's 25 million, blue's 10.

Well, then, 25 million,
because that's how I roll.

WALT JR:
Hey, Uncle Hank, um,

why were you arresting
Mr. Archilleya the other day?

He's a pretty cool guy.

Well, turns out he has
a record. Yeah, a couple
of possession beefs.

We figured he was
the guy that was stealing
your school's chemistry gear.

I mean, you know,
he had a key, fit the profile.

And when we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt.

Which goes to prove
old huge Hugo
ain't so cool after all.

It's to you, Walt.
Yeah, I'll call.

You know, I can't believe
the school system

didn't know about
this guy's record.

I mean, that's pretty scary.
How could something like that

just slip through the cracks?
WALT: I don't know.

I mean, for what it's worth,
Hugo just doesn't strike me
as a thief.

Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt,
but you wouldn't know a criminal

if he was close enough
to check you for a hernia.

That said, we got a search warrant,
and we tore old Hugo's house apart.

Turns out
he's a major-league pothead.

But he didn't
raid your chemistry set.

You hiding something?

I'm in. And the river card.

Oh.

Yeah, I got nothing, I'm out.

I'm out.

Yowza.

When old holes-in-her-purse bails,
you know you're in deep.

Looks like it's you and me, buddy.

What's gonna happen to him. Hugo?

Well, I mean, he's gonna
lose his job, like he should.

Probably spend a couple months in
county, because it's not his first rap.

I'm waiting.

You gonna man up
or are you gonna puss out?

Hank.

What? Sorry.

I'm all in.

No, no, no. You bad,
bad, bad, horrible liar.

What are you smoking there, huh?

You got a heart?
You got the flush, don't you?

Nope. Not falling for it, buddy.
I fold.

Talk about anticlimactic.
HANK: Hey.

Your cards couldn't
have been that bad,
come on.

Oh, my God.
You threw away an ace?

HANK: What are you doing?
And a cowboy for what?

Oh.

A handful of nothing.

Hey, man, he's out.

Well, where is he, then?

You the guy?

Yeah, I'm the guy.

How is he?

Got some busted ribs,
and like that.

Got messed up pretty good.

I was all, like,
"Damn, Tuco, chill, ese."

I don't know what got
into him. Seriously.

Oh, he's out, man. Way out.

They got him
doped up big time.

So you're the cook, huh?

Yo, I didn't catch your name.

Tell me about this Tuco.

Tell me everything about him.

Have a seat, Heisenberg.

I don't imagine
I'll be here very long.

No?

[CHUCKLES]

All right.

Be that way.

It's your meeting.

Why don't you start talking
and tell me what you want?

Fifty thousand dollars.

[LAUGHS]

Oh, man.
Fifty G's? How you figure that?

Thirty-five
for the pound of meth you stole,

and another fifteen
for my partner's pain and suffering.

Partner.

Oh, yeah, I remember that little bitch.

So you must be Daddy.

Let me get this straight.

I steal your dope,

I beat the piss
out of your mule boy,

and then you walk in here
and you bring me more meth?

That's a brilliant plan, ese.

Brilliant.

You got one part of that wrong.

This is not meth.

Are you fucking nuts?

You wanna find out?

[COCKS GUN]

No, no, Gonzo, calma.

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

You got balls, I'll give you that.

All right, all right.
I'll give you your money.

That crystal
that your partner brought me,

it sold faster than 10-dollar ass
in TJ.

Let's say you bring me
another pound next week.

Money up front.

All right.

Money up front.

Sometimes you gotta rob
to keep your riches.

Just as long as we got
an understanding.

One pound is not gonna cut it.
You have to take two.

Oh, really?

Hey, what is that shit?

Fulminated mercury,

and a little tweak of chemistry.
