Yeah.
Do you know where the manager is?
[Indistinct under machinery sounds] Are you the manager, Mr. Warren?
Yeah.
I'm Joe Blake. So?
I was told you have a job.
And who told you that, Joe Blake?
I didn't get his name.
Just this.
So this is what they're sending me now.
How old are you, 28? 27.
27. What the hell you doing here, Joe Blake?
I want my country back, sir.
You want it back? You never had it.
Sir?
You were still sucking your thumb when they dropped the bomb.
This sh¡t hole's the only country you've ever known.
Well, my father told me what it was like, before the war.
Your father, huh?
He said every man was free.
How do I know you're not a spy?
A spy?
The resistance... what's left of it... is shot through with them.
Half my friends are dead.
Guess that's why they're down to kids like you.
I'm not a spy.
You know what those brownshirts out there would do if they caught you?
I'm not afraid to die.
Me, either. Might be a relief, actually.
But how you feel about pain?
Pain? Yeah.
When they're plucking your fingernails out one by one, or they're cracking your balls open like walnuts.
That's when maybe you stop caring about what your old man said and tell Johnny Jackboot out there my name, or just about anything else he wants. You're so afraid, why are you here?
I fought in the war, kid.
I saw my buddies' brains get blown out on Virginia Beach.
You... You're just a punk who could get me caught.
Yeah, I guess I'm afraid of pain.
I don't have any buddies who died in the war.
I don't really know what freedom is.
But I'm not a punk and I'm not a spy, Mr. Warren.
I'm here because I want to do the right thing.

I'm sorry, the furniture in this room is inappropriate for the crown prince and princess.
Trade Minister, I assure you these are very fine pieces, the same as the fuhrer has in Berlin.
We're happy to replace it, of course, if you'll send us information on the proper pieces.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you, Ambassador.
We're deeply honored to receive the crown prince and princess as guests here at the embassy.
It is an harmonious expression of the friendship between the German and Japanese peoples.

Chi?

It comes from the Chinese. They believe there's a spirit in things, bringing good or bad luck.

"Allowed." But for how much longer?

You seem troubled, Trade Minister.

Thank you.
And how was your flight?
New York to San Francisco in under two hours.
[Chuckles] German technology.
We Japanese cannot hope to compete.
Technology is not the measure of a great civilization.
Forgive me, captain, I must confirm your identity.
Of course.
I'm told Sweden is a lovely country, but I never visited.
I don't know the first thing about exports, I'm afraid.
Thank you.
You seem burdened, Mr. Tagomi.
[Sighs] I have consulted the I ching.
Those sticks you throw.
Oracle favors our meeting.
Good to hear, since both our governments would execute us if they knew we were talking.
The man you are to meet will arrive from Tokyo in two days' time.
He's traveling with the crown prince and princess?
And what news do you bring from Berlin?
The fuhrer's health is poor, and Goebbels and Himmler, they're jockeying for power.
Neither seeks peace.
They deny it in public, but both men think the partition of the Americas was a mistake.
They've dropped the bomb before, and they won't hesitate to drop it again.
Then there will be war.
Once the fuhrer dies...
Without question.
And this city would be one of the first ones to be erased from the map.
What are you so gloomy about, Mr. Tagomi?
You said the oracle favors our meeting.
Fate is fluid, Captain Wegener.
Destiny is in the hands of men.
You know our only hope, don't you?
Yeah, we've got no hope.
You're wrong. It's Rommel.
Rommel? Yeah.
All these little rats... Goebbels and Himmler and goring... all scurrying around, waiting for the old man to die. The desert fox swoops in, wipes 'em all out.
Rommel's retired.
Yeah, but he's still in his early 70s.
He's a hell of a lot more vigorous than Mr. mustache, don't you think?
Yeah, I suppose.
Cover for me, will you?
Okay, sure.
Mr. Matson?
Yeah, Frank?
Uh, I'm... I'm just wondering, have you had a chance to look at the designs?
You just gave them to me this morning, Frank.
Right, and?
And as it happens, I have looked at them.
They're quite beautiful.
Thank you.
But look, they're degenerate, Frank.
You just said they're beautiful.
How can jewelry be degenerate?
Japs only want the old-timey stuff, like the colt .45s, Americana.
No one has actually tried selling them jewelry.
And no one's going to.
Come on, Frank, come back from fairy land.
You're a solid worker. You've got a solid job.
Count your blessings.
May I?
Sure.
Guy next to me was just snoring.
I can never sleep on buses, can you?
What brings you to the neutral zone?
Oh, just visiting a friend.
You must have some interesting friends.
I don't know what you mean.
You see any other white girls on this bus?
I mean, take a look around, darlin'.
Wrong color, wrong religion, wrong bedmate.
The Nazis catch 'em, and poof! Up in smoke they go.
But the japs are happy to let 'em scramble out of the pacific states.
They can hole up in the rocky mountains, or run down to South America if they like.
What's it like, the neutral zone?
[Chuckles] You ever seen them westerns that the fuhrer watches?
It's like that, lawless.
Except for the marshal, of course.
The marshal?
This is your first time, isn't it?
He's a Nazi agent, and he hunts down enemies of the Reich.
He strings 'em up and he burns 'em alive.

I'll find him, Obergruppenfuhrer.
[Sighs]
[Footsteps approach] Heil Hitler.
Why was this man left unattended?
The...
Subject is unconsciousness, Obergruppenfuhrer.
Yes, I can see that.
Your orders were to flog this man until he answered your questions.
Obergruppenfuhrer, the subject cannot wake up.
Has he answered your questions?
No, Obergruppenfuhrer.
Then your orders are keep flogging him.
You torture men.
You have a problem with beating a man to death?
No, Obergruppenfuhrer.
Good.
Then do as you're told.
You're smiling, Erich.
You already know the answers to any of questions that he would ask this man.
Of course.
So the subject will die in captivity. Indeed.
His friends in the resistance will see his disfigured body, and they will conclude that he was only so badly beaten because he refused to talk. They will conclude that we don't know that truck is headed to Canon City, or what it is carrying.
I have much to learn from you, Obergruppenfuhrer.

[sighs] What happened?
Ed said you were going to do something terrible.
Are you okay?
Don't, okay?
The Kempeitai, they came looking for you.
I'm sorry.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Maybe the start of something.
I don't know.
Um, something going on out there.
They closed half the city.
Yeah, the Jap prince got shot.
What?
Your ma has been worried about you.
You should, uh, you should go see her.
[door opens]
[door closes] Please try to rest, Your Highness.
I have spent the entire night in this chair, Tagomi-san.
I am rested.
Your Chinese oracle... it cannot foresee every eventuality.
Whoever is responsible for this outrage will be brought to justice.
[knock on door]
[door opens]
[speaking Japanese] The final bullet fragments were removed, but he remains in a critical condition.
There was an injury to the heart.
But you repaired it.
We have done all we can, Your Highness.
You may sit with him while we wait.
[knock on door] There she is.
What a nice surprise.
Honey. Anne?
Come here and look who breezed in.
Oh, there you are.
Where have you been?
What's going on out there?
Why are there Japs all over the street?
Who knows, Ma?
Thank you. Look, I brought you herbs. Oh. Shall I make some tea?
No. I'm not drinking that Nip poison anymore.
Do you think the Nazis are finally going to invade?
I mean, it's like the start of the Occupation all over again.
Why don't we let her sit down, honey?
Okay? Come on, sit down. Here.
Okay.
So where have you been hiding?
Um... Oh, I haven't been hiding, Ma, just, you know, I've been busy.
Hmm.
So busy you couldn't stop by and say hi to your mother?
I'm sorry.
Well, I mean, I thought maybe you got a job or something. No. I'm sure that Frank needed her around, right?
Honey, are you all right?
Yeah.
It's just a terrible thing what they did to that boy.
Frank told you?
He didn't tell you I came by?
Frank will be fine.
He's healing already.
Wounds heal, but, I don't know... losing your sister and her kids like that, I can't even imagine.
I tell you, Hitler was never going to stand for the Jews living here in peace forever.
I tell you, that bastard has got a plan for all of us.
Okay, okay, it's okay.
Have you seen Trudy?
Have you seen your sister?
FATHER
Juliana.
Juliana.
Have you heard anything from your sister?
Uh...
Not for a few days.
          FATHER I keep telling her don't worry.
I'd say "Don't worry. She's a free spirit. She'll be in touch when she's ready," right?
Right. I... I'm so sorry. I have to go.
Frank.
Frank.
[sobbing] Ah. I didn't know. [tires screech]
          JULIANA How did this happen?
Uh, I... I don't remember exactly.
Look, if you could just stop it bleeding.
I can't be late for work.
It's one day, Frank. Can't you just stay home?
I have to make up the time I missed.
If I'd known the damage I'd cause by getting on that damn bus...
You had to do something for Trudy.
Yeah.
I should have talked to you.
You'd have gone anyway.
Not if I'd known what they'd do to you.
And John and Emily.
Will there be a funeral?
They were incinerated.
There's nothing left.
Bill must be...
[sigh] He's, uh, he's holding a kind of memorial service later, but I... I...
I shouldn't be there.
Hold still.
Can I ask you something?
Why did they let you go?
They, uh, they caught some woman smuggling films.
They thought she had Trudy's.
Thanks.
So what now?
I'm going to work.
You can, uh...
You can go to the dojo, I guess.
Well, does that mean we just... go back to the way things were?
We can't ever go back.
I'm talking about surviving, getting through today, Juliana.
I'm not looking beyond that right now.
[knocking] Mr. Tagomi, you've met my faithful bodyguard.
They know, don't they?
About what?
That I'm not Baynes.
They took my passport at the Embassy, and they haven't let me out of their sight since.
Where's the microfilm now?
I don't have it, not at hand.
I...swallowed it.
And it's proving difficult to relax.
At least it's safe.
The safety helps no one.
I cannot leave here without completing my mission.
We no longer have a choice.
You said that your oracle favored a connection.
Have you lost faith in that?
Our mission now is to get you out of the Pacific States alive.
Give me one more chance with the Science Minister.
The only chance you have is a single shuttle from here to New York tonight.
I will retrieve your Swedish passport.
Tagomi-san.
Risking your life to prevent a world war is one thing.
Risking it to save mine was never part of the deal.
I will not wash another good man's blood from my hands today.
          ED Did she tell you what happened out there?
We didn't really talk about it.
Did you tell her about the gun?
What did I say to you this morning?
Yeah, but I didn't think you meant Jules.
What, you didn't think she was covered by "You can't tell anybody"?
None of this is my fault, Frank. Whether I fired that thing or not, they could still be looking for me, so keep your mouth shut.
[clicking] This is good work, Frank.
Thank you, Mr. Wyndam-Matson.
You still designing that jewelry of yours?
No, sir. I'm done with that.
Everything else okay?
Yeah. Yeah, everything's back to normal. All of these drains must be checked individually, every one within a 5-kilometer radius of the Embassy.
Yes, Inspector.
And the alleyways, all...
[grunt] If the gunman is not apprehended, Sergeant Yoshida, you will act as Kaishakunin when I commit Seppuku.
[Japanese command]
[speaking Japanese] Miss Crain, have you reported to the Kempeitai?
Why?
The dojo is a place of harmony.
Nothing can be allowed to interfere with that. They came here? I'm afraid that, as a wanted person, there can be no question of you continuing to practice with us.
[speaking Japanese] Um... you've been looking for me.
My name is Juliana Crain.
Could you tell someone I'm here, please?
Mr. Blake, I am Major Klemm.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
Apologies for keeping you waiting.
I hope it wasn't too uncomfortable.
Not as uncomfortable as the ride here.
It's not like I expected a parade or anything.
Those guys were pretty rough.
If you were being watched by insurgents at the truck drop-off, your cover will remain intact. We haven't heard from you since you set off to meet the Man In the High Castle. No. Well, we have several gaps we need to fill.
          YOSHIDA Where were you, Miss Crain?
I went to look for my sister.
She disappeared.
Her name is Trudy.
We know her name.
Where did you go?
The places Trudy loved.
Twin Peaks first.
When there was no sign of her, I took a bus to Yosemite.
You camped there?
You told Mr. Frink you were camping.
You were listening.
          KLEMM I don't understand, Mr. Blake.
These insurgents on the mountain, what did they want from you?
The film.
But Obergruppenführer Smith ordered you not to take the film with you.
Yes.
But I thought I had a real shot at finding the Man In the High Castle.
As it turns out, the film was the only thing that convinced him I wasn't a spy.
Do you know Randall Baker, Miss Crain?
Did your sister ever mention that man?
          KLEMM So you lost the film.
I wouldn't say I lost it.
Then you still have it.
No. So you lost it.
[door closes] What did you lose, Joe?
The film I was carrying, sir, was taken from me by Lemuel Washington, leader of the Resistance in Canon City.
Carry on, Major.
Don't mind me, Joe. No.
No, I don't recognize him.
Please continue.
          SMITH Are any pages missing, Major?
          KLEMM No, Obergruppenführer, I don't believe so.
I don't see any mention of the girl.
The girl?
You don't mean the girl who died in the car.
That's the only girl I can think of.
The one the Marshal was after?
          JOE Honestly, she was no one.
          SMITH No one?
This Marshal, Mr. Kahler, what did he say in his report?
          KLEMM That Mr. Blake defended the girl, told him to leave her alone because he was using her.
That's correct. I thought she was the courier you had told me about, sir. And did Major Klemm tell you how important it is not to leave anything out of this account, Joe?
Yes, sir, he did.
Look, this whole thing has been a misunderstanding.
          YOSHIDA Look at the picture.
I just want things to go back to normal.
I've never seen him.
          JULIANA I came here voluntarily.
If I'd known you were looking for me, I would have come back sooner to clear things up.
But some things can't be cleared up, can they?
Like Mr. Frink's sister... his niece and nephew. We are all subject to rules, Miss Crain, and if we fail to live by them, the consequences are severe.
You knew that.
Is there anything you would like to add to your transcript, Joe?
I don't think so, sir.
I'm sorry. Is that a yes or a no?
No, Obergruppenführer.
You can leave for now.
But things will never return to normal for you.
They cannot.
[sniffle]
[clatter] It's okay.
Who are you?
A friend of Randall's.
I'm pretty sure Randall's not here.
Randall's dead. I need to know if you delivered the film he gave you.
Did you know Trudy?
Enough to know how badly she wanted to get that film to Canon City.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
You won't until it's too late.
The film got to where it was supposed to go.
Thank you.
My turn.
The Man In the High Castle... why is he collecting them? All we know is we get them to him and he passes back intelligence that we can use against the Pons.
How's that possible?
If you came here looking for answers about the films, you'll be disappointed.
I came here because Trudy was here.
You've lost a lot all at once.
I know how that goes.
Once you've decided to go on, you've got to find a how.
For me, the only way was to fight.
It has to be about something more.
Sir, I know it doesn't seem like a complete success.
But my mission wasn't to retrieve a film or kill the Man In the High Castle, sir.
My mission was to identify and gather intelligence on key figures in the Resistance.
Then I found Lemuel Washington. I did that.
I kept my cover intact.
Lemuel Washington disappeared yesterday, along with his entire family.
We don't know where he is.
Oh, you failed, Joe.
You failed. Do you know why you failed?
You are one component in a complex machine that only works if every part does exactly what it's supposed to do in sync with the whole.
Now, if you decide, without knowing what the other components are doing, to simply go your own way, eventually that machine is going to break down. Don't ever disobey a direct order from me again, Joe.
I'm sorry, Obergruppenführer.
Okay.
Where are you spending VA Day tomorrow, Joe?
The files you requested, Obergruppenführer.
Thank you. I'll take these home with me.
Bring the car around, please.
Mm-hmm.
Well?
Uh, I don't know. I don't have any plans.
Well, then you'll be my guest.
Sir...
Joe.
I'm inviting you to my house for the celebration. I know you haven't spent a lot of time among your own recently, and, uh, tomorrow's about community.
It's about family.
Thank you, sir. I'd like that very much.
See you there.
11 o'clock sharp. Don't be late.
Frank.
Mr. Crothers? Hi. Ed McCarthy.
We've met a couple of times.
I'm an old buddy of Frank's.
I'm real sorry, sir. Real sorry.
Yeah. Me, too.
These are all friends of yours and Laura's?
And bosses and people I work with.
Laura met a few of them.
I have to go on working here, and these are honorable people.
Do you know how it would look to have no ceremony at all for my family?
Frank, you don't have to justify...
You're damn right I don't.
If there are no answers here, then where do I look?
[chuckle] I'm serious.
Do you have any idea how many different fսck¡ng ways I nearly died trying to get that film to where it was supposed to go? Okay.
We've got one thing.
We think someone set up Randall and Trudy.
It's the only way the Pons could have known where that film would be.
The day they took Randall, he mailed this to the box we use.
Name mean anything to you?
They had a contact at the Nippon Building.
But if whoever this is is leaking information about our activity, we need to know about it.
Do you think it could be a link to the films?
We don't know.
What we do know is there's a job in there.
At the Nippon?
They only ever want young women.
Anybody over 27 should be married.
I wouldn't ask you to do it. I wouldn't ask anybody.
Before you go into a government building looking for someone who might have got at least two people killed, you'd better be sure a certain kind of life is no better than death for you. Because that's a choice you might not get to make again.
MAN
Death is very much part of a life... a natural part of life's cycle for all things and not something to be feared or spoken in hushed tone. Therefore, we must not weep today for the loss of...
John and Emilia and Lorna because the spirit is eternal.
Emily and Laura.
Hi, Frank.
Do I know you?
You maybe wouldn't remember.
Mark Sampson.
Laura worked for me for a little while in the hardware store on Mission.
You came by a couple of times.
Oh. Yeah.
You're the artist, right?
I... You know, I used to be, I guess.
But not anymore.
I just want to say that... well, what can be said? I'm sorry.
Thank you. Yeah, thanks.
If you're ever in the neighborhood and you feel like talking, just drop by. Okay?
Number 42, right across from the store.
To life, Frank.
[speaking Japanese] Ah. Inspector, please.
No, thank you, Trade Minister.
I will not stay long.
I appreciate you coming at such a busy time.
What could we not discuss on the telephone?
I felt it correct to speak in person.
Guests of the Ministry have asked when their passports would be returned. I assured them I would inquire.
As soon as their identities are verified and their reasons for being in the Pacific States, all of their documents will be returned. How long do you estimate it will take?
I offer no estimate.
You met with a foreign visitor at his hotel this morning.
I met with several guests.
They're honorable businessmen, not assassins.
Their time is valuable.
All of our time is valuable.
I understand what is at stake.
Do you?
I was with the Royal Couple.
So yes, I believe I do.
Then no doubt you will understand why I must disappoint you, Trade Minister.
I am sorry, but in this instance there will be no exceptions.
[toilet flushes]
[whistling]
[ring]
[ring] Baynes.
Your guard will change in eight minutes.
You have two minutes to get out of your room.
Take elevator 3 to the lobby.
[ding] Take this. Keep walking.
Not too quickly. Your taxi to the airport is waiting. That is a diplomatic ticket and enables you to board any flight in the Pacific States without identification.
There will be repercussions for you.
I will deal with them.
That's him, the Science Minister.
And the man with him is named Muller.
He knows me.
You cannot.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.
My apologies, but I know you, don't I?
I don't believe so, unless you're familiar with Stockholm.
Identity card.
I'm told that someone in personnel would see me about a job.
You here about a job, too?
My name is Juliana Crain.
I don't know if you have any positions available at the moment, Mr. Eto.
But I'd like to be considered for anything suitable.
I type pretty well.
I speak some Japanese.
I'm a fast learner.
Stand.
Remove your coat.
There may be a role you are suited to, subject to references, here in personnel. Alongside your other work, it would involve undertaking certain personal services as and when I require them.
What kind of services?
You wish to work here?
Yes, sir.
It is an honor for a girl like you to be employed here.
I know that, sir.
It is not for you to question your duties.
You simply do.
[unzipping] Do you want the job or not?

[door opens]
[door closes]
[knock on door] Enter.
[speaking Japanese] This is our world now, Sergeant.
Part of the Empire.
And it is our duty to sacrifice whatever is necessary to protect it.
Yes, sir.
          KAREN You don't ever watch the films.
No exceptions.
It doesn't matter to us what you saw.
I just saw myself being executed by Joe Blake.
And the whole city destroyed by an A bomb.
We just paid the Yakuza 10,000 yen for you, and now you're asking us to get you out?
Look, Frank's wanted by the Kempeitai.
And neither of you thought to mention that?
Will you help us or not?
[sigh]
[voices on television] Major Karl Müller of the Reich?
Kempeitai Chief Inspector Kido.
Please come in.
[floor creaks] Chief Inspector.
This belongs to you?
Yes, Inspector.
And I'm prepared to make a full confession.
[no audible dialogue] Okay. We can get you out.
But it's going to cost you.
We don't have anything left.
What do you want?
Your help getting that film back from Joe Blake and killing him.
Help us do that, and I'm cleared to put you on a boat to Mexico.
Killing him? A few hours ago, I gave everything I had to save the son of a b¡tch.
Wait. Because of what's on the film?
Because he's a goddamn Nazi.
You said he didn't deny it. He makes it back to New York, that film and all of our names go to Nazi High Command. fսck.
Juliana. You're the only one who stands a chance of getting close enough to him to do it and grab the film.
          LEMUEL You're the only one he trusts.
You want to kill him?
You go right ahead, but leave her out of it.
Well, you did it before.
The Nazi agent back in Canon City.
That was self-defense.
You're asking me to kill a man in cold blood, to assassinate him.
Ah...
No.
I can't do that.
I won't do that.
I know. Uh...
I'll do it.
Fish to the lure.
You get him someplace where I can get a nice clean decent shot.
I'll do the rest.
Oh, my God.
Go through his desk.
Anything official must be destroyed.
I do not understand, sir.
I think you do, Sergeant.
What is this man's crime?
The shooting of the Crown Prince.
Hai.
But we've been pursuing Frank Frink.
The witness said Frank never discharged his weapon.
Then why not arrest and interrogate this man?
Because that is exactly what the Nazis would want us to do.
There'd be war.
A war that currently our Empire cannot win.
Nobody must ever know about this, Sergeant. But if Frink is gone and we cannot report the capture of the real assassin, how can Tokyo be satisfied?
Whatever sacrifice is necessary.
That is my burden alone, and I shall carry it.
Yours is to remain silent and to act as my Kaishakunin.
Now do you understand, Yoshida-san?
Hai.
The desk.
Oberstgruppenführer.
Sieg heil.
Good morning, John.
This is Junge, my aid.
I brought rifles for both of us, John.
Oh, thank you. I prefer to use my own.
          KAREN I need you to listen to me carefully, Juliana.
He's a Nazi, so the Embassy is the only place he can go now.
Once you're inside, ask for the visa office.
It's on the eighth floor.
They'll send you to the back stairs, and that gives you access to all levels.
Somebody will tell me if you managed to contact Obergruppenführer Smith.
Yes, Mr. Blake.
He'll probably be in one of the ad men offices... levels 4 to 6.
We can get you in, but you have to get him out.
You'll need a story. He'll be suspicious.
I'll come up with something.
HEYDRICH
I felt we should clear the air, you and I, rid ourselves of the suspicion that seems to have developed between us. We can speak candidly here.
Nobody can hear us or reach us.
I assumed that was the point.
[chuckling] You are a formidable man, John.
You believe Captain Connolly had a hand in the ambush on your car?
As Captain Connolly killed himself yesterday, sadly we can only speculate.
You must at least suspect I gave the order. It's understandable.
There is, after all, strong precedent for senior figures removing comrades in pursuit of the greater good. but sometimes such figures underestimate their comrades. I would hate to make that mistake.
The world will change forever today.
It's too late for us to do anything about that. Now it's simply a question of whether you are part of the future or the past.

Make yourself comfortable in here until then.
I have further meetings.
Okay. Thank you, sir.
You report to Obergruppenführer Smith, do you not, Mr. Blake?
Yeah, that's correct.
Have you spoken to him?
We're still trying to reach him.
So your mission here was a success?
I can't really talk about that.
Of course.
[speaking Japanese] Chief Inspector Kido, Trade Minister.
Juliana Crain.
Miss Crain is not in the office today.
I am aware of that. Nor will she be ever again.
She is the girlfriend of Frank Frink, the man wanted in connection with the shooting of the Crown Prince.
I'm sure there must be some mistake.
There have undoubtedly been several, along with warnings unheeded. I am sorry, Trade Minister.
I can do nothing about the loss of face you will suffer in connection with this as and when Mr. Frink is inevitably apprehended. But this time there can be no mitigation.
This time?
Did you really think I did not know who helped the Nazi Wegener to leave?
However, I also knew why you did so. Please, do not imagine I remained silent for any other reason than your own: the security of the Empire. Why are you telling me now? Because there comes a time when all men must bear the weight of their responsibility, Trade Minister.
And our day has come.

If anything happens, you get on that boat.
Hey, don't even think that.
Think about what's on the other side.
That film shows Joe as a Nazi, and he is.
I got on that bus with Trudy's film because I thought it meant hope for the future. But this new one means that everything I've done and everything I've caused has been for nothing.
There is no hope.
There's no future.
But we have to go on.
What else is there?
Okay.
Let's go.
Ed.
What are you doing in here?
Uh...
I, uh, I messed up on the detailing, sir.
I thought I'd melt it before production tallies were recorded.
You're too much of a damn perfectionist.
This barrel's been bored out.
Sir...
Tell me this is not what the Kempeitai are looking for.
[speaking Japanese] Trade Minister. Your meeting, Trade Minister.
The only way... to view the truth of life, Kotomichi... is to stand apart from it, to see... the consequence of every thought, every action. But still... we are bound by time and space, unable to steer our destiny.
That is why you consult the I ching... to glimpse what lies ahead.
I'm nothing but a misguided fool, Kotomichi.
No.
You are a good man.
Perhaps too good for this world.

You lying son of a b¡tch!
I had to know if it was true.
Bullshit. You came for the film.
That's all you care about.
That is not true.
Then why?
The Resistance sent me to lure you out so they can kill you.
And you'd do that?
I've seen who you really are.
What are you talking about?
We watched the film, Joe. You're in it.
You're wearing a Nazi uniform, and you're executing people.
I don't know what you've seen, but whatever it is, it wasn't me.
That's not who I am.
You want to know how I know?
Guess what I saw on the film I took to Canon City.
You said you never watched the film.
I didn't tell you because you were so full of hope.
You saw the Allies winning, right?
Well, mine wasn't newsreel.
It was Soviet propaganda for Josef Stalin from 1954.
Stalin was executed...
In '49, exactly.
So whatever you saw is no more real than Stalin coming back from the dead.
You know what is real?
If I don't get this film back to New York, I'm a dead man.
And the man I report to won't just kill me.
He'll kill you, Frank, and people you're close to.
Help me, and I'll keep all those names he doesn't know out of it.
I swear to you.
Does this belong to you, Mr. McCarthy?
Yes, sir.
You converted it?
That's right.
And you tried to destroy it because...
Possession of a firearm is a very serious offense.
But not as serious as attempting to assassinate the Crown Prince of Japan.
This distinctive weapon was described by several witnesses.
We know at least two bullets were fired from this gun.
We are continuing to pursue Mr. Frank Frink for this crime, but if you say this gun belongs to you, that changes everything. Do you know where Frank is?
That is not relevant to the truth.
The only relevant question is did you use this gun to shoot the Crown Prince?
What is the power of the films?
Do you know why the Führer prizes them so highly?
You'd have to address any questions on that subject to the Führer himself.
The Führer is a spent force, John.
We both know that.
I don't believe for a second that sharing the land of your birth with the Japanese sits well with you.
I'm sure the Führer has his reasons.
Loyalty is an overrated virtue, John, championed by the bovine, dignified by the weak to justify their weakness. It's certainly not worthy of you. Neither is betrayal.
Ultimately, John, we owe our hearts and our minds not to any one man but to an idea, and that idea is under threat. It is up to the best of us to step forward now as both the Führer and nature demands.
The strong must overcome the weak.
Very shortly now, John, the telephone is going to ring.
Who will be calling?
I suspect you already worked that out on our walk.
Nein!
The American Reich is vital to our interests.
I'd like you with me, and I would be willing to hear what you would want for yourself.
However, I need to be sure I can call on the same level of commitment as the Führer.
I have to hear your decision before I receive the call.
Okay.
Yeah. I understand.
Was that Lem?
No. We got to go.
At least there should be fewer Kempeitai around.
Why?
They caught the guy who shot the Crown Prince.
Who?
I don't know.
Some guy who works in a gun factory.
Come on, Frank. We got to move.
I got to make a call.
No. We don't have time for that.
[line ringing] Mr. McCarthy, it's Frank. Is Ed there?
You selfish piece of sh¡t.
They'll kill him. You know that.
And all because of you.
Go without me.
What happened?
Get Juliana away. [film projector whirring] Sieg heil!
          HEYDRICH Well, John?
Rudolph will never get a weapon close enough to Führer to kill him.
Our leader's paranoia at least has one advantage.
He hides weapons everywhere.
I need to know one thing, Reinhard.
I need to know you're not alone in this.
[ring]
[ring]
[ring]
[ring] No, John. I am not alone in this.
Now, are you with me?
Reinhard.
Mein Führer.
[hyperventilating]
[gunshot] There it is.
I really appreciate you doing this.
What, sending you to Mexico?
No, believing in me.
Not many people have ever done that.
Come on.
She did it.
Do you hear me? She fսck¡ng did it.
Atta girl.
They're on their way to you.
She should take him through that door any moment.
Copy that.
I guess it's too late to ask you to go with me.
I'm sorry, Joe.
Wow.
You're good.
Sniper? No. Yeah, you know, I'm sorry, too.
For everything.
You said once to me that I might be a different man if I'd met you sooner.
Please.
Well, I am.
You changed me.
That's why I'm not the guy in this film.
I'm still glad I met you.
Oh, God.
I don't believe the film.
I don't believe it.
I believe you.
Hey.
No. No!
No! Ed!
Ed, no! No!
I'm here!
I'm here!
Where the fսck are they? They should be with you.
sh¡t. Get out there!
Ah, damn it.
What have you done?
[Woman speaking Japanese] Hai, sensei!
