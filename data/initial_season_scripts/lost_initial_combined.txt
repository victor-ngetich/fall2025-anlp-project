Ladies and gentlemen, today,
the first of what may be...

as many as 10 million families
per year...

is setting out on its epic voyage
into man's newest frontier...

for colonization: deep space.

Reaching out into other worlds from
our desperately overcrowded planet...




a series of deep-thrust telescopic
probes into neighboring galaxies...

have conclusively
established Alpha Centauri...

as the one planet within
the range of our technology...

able to furnish ideal conditions
for human existence.

The space family, selected from
more than 2 million volunteers...

for its unique balance of scientific
achievement, emotional stability...

and pioneer resourcefulness, will spend
the 98 years of their voyage...

frozen into the state
of suspended animation.

[ All Speaking In Foreign Languages ]

[ Tabulating ]

[ Man Over P.A.] This is Alpha Control.
We are at six minutes, 40 seconds...

and holding.

We have encountered an electrical
power failure in our computer...

at the Bermuda
tracking station.




Six minutes, 40 seconds
and holding.

[ Computers Continue Tabulating ]

This is Alpha Control
resuming countdown.

We are at six minutes,
40 seconds and counting.

Power has been restored
at our Bermuda tracking station...

six minutes, 30 seconds
and counting.

The spaceship's electronic brain
will take over for the balance...

of the century-long
hibernation...

during which it will be traveling at
the almost unimaginable speed of light.

Here now is the Gemini 12, the culmination
of nearly 40 years of intensive research...

and the most sophisticated piece of
hardware yet devised by the mind of man.

Bold in concept,
brilliant in execution...

this most delicate,
yet most colossal of instruments...

makes possible man's thrust
into deep space...

and will,
in approximately five minutes...

set out on its quest
for a new world.

Heading the expedition
will be Dr. John Robinson...

Professor of Astrophysics at
the University of Stellar Dynamics...

now seen
on your screen.

With him, marking the first time in history
that anyone but an adult male has passed...

the International Space
Administration's grueling...

physical and emotional screening
for intergalactic flight...

will be his wife,
Dr. Maureen Robinson...

the distinguished biochemist of the
New Mexico College of Space Medicine.

Their daughter, Judith, aged 19,
who has rather heroically postponed...

all hopes for a career
in the musical comedy field...

for the next two centuries,
at least.

Their son, Will, who recently was graduated
from the Camdo Canyon School of Science...

at the age of nine with the highest
average in the school's history.

And their daughter, Penny,
age 11, I.Q., 147...

hobby, zoology.

Their assistant,
Dr. Donald West...

graduate student from
the Center for Radio Astronomy...

is the same young man who last year
rocked the scientific world...

with his theory regarding other
planets' fitness for human habitation.

[ Beeping Rapidly ]

Electromagnetic miracles
now come into play.

This cosmic glow, induced through
the genius of advanced technology...

will put the Robinson family
in a state of limbo...

enabling them to make a lifetime flight
while aging but a second...

in the time of man.

From this moment on, the
Family Robinson and their assistant...

are in a state of suspended animation,
which is to last for the next 98 years.

- And now--
- [ Telephone Rings ]

- One moment, please.
- [ TV Announcer ] Ladies and gentlemen...

the president
of the United States.

Fellow Americans,
friends all over the world...

upon the success
of this mission...

will depend whether the explosive
increase of population on this planet...

will ultimately lead to a disaster
from which none will be exempt...

or to a new dawn of plenty
for all of humanity.

None can predict the outcome of this
audacious venture to the very stars.

To those who have
staked their lives...

upon this bold expansion
of man's horizons...

I humbly say:
Go in peace.

The prayers of mankind
are with you.

[ Man Over P.A.]
This is Alpha Control.

Countdown minus
19 seconds and counting.

All systems are green
and go.

Countdown minus 10 seconds.

Eight, seven, six...

five, four, three...

two, one, zero.

Blastoff!

All systems here at Alpha Control
are green and go.

The trajectory
now profiles properly.

The spaceship
is climbing correctly to plan.

Is now passing the point
of maximum dynamic pressure.

If it holds its present attitude,
it will reach perfect orbit.

The fantastic acceleration needed to
break out of the Earth's gravity...

has apparently not affected the
well-being of our space travelers.

Here at Alpha Control, remote readings
appear normal with no indication of change.

Medical telemeters show
all members of the Robinson family...

are safe and well...

still in their total blackout of suspended
animation during this fantastic acceleration...

whose pressures would be
unbearable otherwise.

[ Computers Humming ]

An unpredicted rain of meteors traveling
at speeds of up to 25,000 miles an hour...

have converged in a giant elliptical form
a thousand miles in diameter...

immediately ahead
of the spaceship.

[ Beeping Rapidly ]

Gemini 12, traveling
at 18,400 miles per hour...

cannot be shifted fast enough in its preset
flight pattern to make total escape possible.

[ Electrical Arcing ]

[ Rapid Beeping ]

Gemini 12's fantastic ability
to regenerate its own damage controls...

is now the last hope
for the safety of the Robinson family...

and the success of the flight.

Heat telemeters
here at Alpha Control...

show an outbreak of fire in back
of all the controls in the spaceship.

Unless fire extinguishing
apparatus functions properly...

and control regeneration
occurs immediately...

all hope for the Gemini
is now gone.

[ Indistinct Whirring ]

- [ Humming ]
- Alpha Control's final analysis
on Gemini 12's flight...

indicates unhappily that the spaceship
has either been destroyed...

or must be presumed
lost in space.

[ Indistinct Whirring Continues ]

[ Crash ]

[ John Thinking ]
December 3 in the year 2001.

None of us knows for sure how long
we traveled in suspended animation.

Our atomic clock indicates three
and a half years, but we're not positive.

We do know for a fact that it is now
exactly six months since our landing...

on this unknown planet.

Thank heaven we survived
that terrible crash...

which completely
disabled the spaceship.

We are hopeful of its eventual repair
and our ability to use it again.

Meanwhile,
all goes reasonably well.

- [ Will ] Hey! Hey, come back here!
- We've established a base camp...

domesticated some of the local
animals and cultivated a small farm.

- Debbie.
- [ Will ] Hey, come on back!

- Come back here when I say,
"Come back here!"
- Children.

- Wait till Daddy gets home.
- Come back here!

Hey, come on.
Come back! Please? Come back!

- Mom, when are they coming home?
- Well, let's see.

They were due back
a half an hour ago.

- You don't think anything happened?
- Oh, no. Of course not.

I hope the instruments
are okay.

I hope the instruments
are okay.

This wind might
have smashed everything.

- The wind is stronger.
- It's getting colder.

[ Wind Whistling ]

Look at this thing.
By the day after tomorrow...

the temperature'll
drop 150 below zero.

- What'll we do?
- We're gonna have to head south, but fast.

Abandon the spaceship? What if it's
finally spotted by some passing rocket?

They'll televise the picture
back to Earth.

Oh, yeah. That's great. A picture
showing no signs of life, no survivors.

Don, I'd rather not be found at all if I had
to be picked up by a pair of ice tongs.

Come on.
Let's get out of here.

You don't suppose
we could just button up the hatches...

and stick it out
inside the spaceship, do ya?

We'd freeze to death. Take my word for it.
Even if we could insulate well enough...

the solar batteries
would never stand the drain.

- It's moving day, Dr. West.
- Wait a minute.
There's one gauge we oughta check...

just to see
how much time we do have.

Look.

That... couldn't be.

It is.

A footprint.
Not of a man.

Of a something
that walks on two feet.

Only five times as big as anything
we ever thought of as human.

Giants?
Come on, Doc.

Let's go. I don't want to leave the family
alone a second longer than necessary.

[ Growling ]

[ Gasping ]
I don't believe it.

- Neither do I. But let's get out of here.
- [ Creature Grunts ]

Don!

[ Electrical Arcing ]

- [ Chuckling ] How's it coming?
- Pretty good.

[ Sighs ]

- Don't pick too many, dear.
- [ Judy ] I won't, Mother.

[ Beeping ]

Hey, Mom,
I got it working!

- What?
- The radio telescope.

- Did you locate Dad?
- I'm not so sure.

- Can't you talk to him?
- I've got a picture. No sound.

What do you see?

- See something?
- [ Groans ]

Holy cow, it is!
A giant!

Let me look again.
[ Exhales ]

- Did either of them take a gun with them?
- What's wrong?

- What is it?
- I don't know yet.

Well, then,
why are you talking about guns?

Mom, we've got to do something.
They'll be killed if we don't.

Now, Judy, please. Just calm down.
There's nothing we can do except wait.

- Oh, yes, there is.
- Will.

Will, you come back here,
you hear me? Will!

- Will!
- Will!

There's no other way out.

I'd better
take another look.

- No! Wait!
- Wait for what? Till we starve to death?

We're safe in here. If we get him any
madder, he'll tear this mountain apart.

Sorry, Doc.

[ Low Growling ]

[ Screeches ]

- Guess I didn't help matters much, did I?
- We know he can feel pain.

Yeah. And he knows
we're hiding in here.

[ Continues Growling ]

Look out!

[ Roars ]

[ Screeches ]

[ Will ]
Dad! Dad!

Will! Will!

- Dad!
- Will!

Dad, I killed the giant!
I killed him!

You sure did.

Will... what
are you doin' here?

I saw you in trouble
over the scope, so I--

So you thought
you'd come and save us?

And you did save us. Now, I want you to
promise me something on your word of honor.

- Yes, sir.
- When I tell you to stay
and protect the family...

don't you ever leave
your post again, understand?

If we're gonna survive, we must follow
orders. And that goes for all of us.

There may be
other giants around.

Here.
Put this on.

There you go.

Ah. Not as big
as you thought you were, huh?

- Uh-uh.
- All right. Let's move.

Come on.

Come on, kids. Keep movin'. I want us
out of here in the next five minutes.

[ Wind Whistling ]

- Let's go. I want us to get out
of here as quickly as we can.
- All right.

Children.
Come on, now. Let's go.

Will, where's Penny?
Where's your sister?

She was riding on the turtle, she and the Bloop.
Then all of a sudden, she was gone.

- Where did she go?
- I don't know. I turned around,
and she wasn't there anymore.

- Ohh.
- Don't worry. I'll find her.

Ohh. Penny!

Penny! Penny!

Listen, Don. When that blizzard hits,
which may be sooner than we expect...

the temperature's gonna drop about
60 degrees in less than half an hour.

The moment it hits 10 below, I want you
to take off by way of the inland sea.

Wouldn't we be better off
going by land?

We'd have to go through
the giants' valley, and that's too risky...

especially after that close call
we had this morning.

- Doc, I'm not gonna take off without you.
- Whether I come back or not.

[ Engine Revving ]

Don't worry.

[ Wind Whistling ]

I'm cold.
If I catch pneumonia from this...

they're never ever gonna
let me play with either of you again.

I knew turtles were stubborn, but I thought
you'd have more sense than to run away.

Now we're all lost.

[ Debbie Chittering ]

Hey, come back here! We'd better stick
together, or none of us will get home.

Come on, Debbie.
Come on. Good girl.

Oh, Daddy!

Daddy.

Daddy! Daddy!

- Oh, Daddy, I was so frightened.
- It's all right.

- There's nothing to be frightened of.
It's all right.
- Oh, I'm cold.

I'll bet you are.

Nine below. One more degree,
and they'll leave without us.

- Come on. Piggyback.
- Come on, Debbie. Come on.

- Come on.
- Come on.

- Come on.
- All right?

- Yeah.
- Okay. Hang on, now.

Okay.

[ Debbie Chittering ]

[ Chittering Continues ]

- How do you like it?
- Oh, it's great.

- How's the Bloop?
- Oh, fine.

It won't be long.

- Will?
- [ Will ] Coming!

I had to
get my tester.

[ Maureen ]
Okay, dear. In you go.

We can't leave without Daddy
and Penny. We just can't!

- We have to. We'll all die if we don't.
- Don, please.

- Just a few more minutes.
- You think I like to leave without them?

When Dr. Robinson said 10 below zero,
he didn't just pick a number out of a hat.

That's the deadline, with the emphasis
on "dead," if we don't stick to it.

No! No! I'm not leaving without them.
Don't start the motor! I'm warning you!

Oh, Judy,
please stop it!

We're not going
without them!

Mom, look!

[ Exhales ]

Don, take the gun hatch
just in case.

[ Roaring ]

[ Continues Roaring ]

[ John ]
Don, fire!

[ Gunfire ]

[ Screeches ]

[ Chittering ]

[ Chittering Continues ]

I wonder how cold it is
back at the spaceship now.

- Too cold.
- Oh, no.

- What's the matter?
- Those big boulders didn't
do the power unit any good.

- How long to fix?
- A couple hours, anyway.

I don't know how safe it is,
but we'd better camp here.

## [ Will On Guitar ]

How are you ever gonna dress like
a lady if you don't hold still? Ohh.

- I'm glad Dad decided to camp here.
- Yeah.

All the comforts of home.

Home was never like this.

- Mom, Dad, betcha don't know what I saw.
- What?

Judy and Don. He was
kissing her on the hand like this.

Bet he picked up
a million germs.

Bet he picked up
a million germs.

Well, Penny, dear, young people
sometimes have ways of doing things...

which, to wiser heads
such as you and I...

may seem a little strange.

In other words,
I should mind my own business?

- That's right.
- I thought so.

[ Laughing ]

I do find it hard to think of Judy
as anything but a child.

Well, considering
the population implosion up here...

we can't very well ask her
to play the field, now, can we?

No. That's right.

Now I know the one scientific specialty
we didn't bring from Earth.

- What's that?
- A marriage counselor.

- For them?
- Who else?

[ Thunderclap ]

- Power D-F.
- Powering One-W now.

[ Electrical Arcing ]

- Try W-Two.
- W-Two.

- [ Thunderclap ]
- [ John ] We must find a cave for protection.

We'll be killed if we don't.
Seat belts on, huh?

- [ Maureen ] They're all set.
- I'll switch when clear, Doc.

[ John ]
All right. Hold it steady, then.

[ Thunderclaps ]

What kind of a place
is this?

[ Judy ]
Well, it looks like a big cave.

Let's take a look.

- [ Penny ] It's a city!
- There are no cities out here,
for cryin' out loud.

- Then what is it?
- Some sort of geological accident.

How do I know? Ask Don.
My field's electronics.

Well, pardon me.

- It looks almost like some sort of a--
- A kind of a castle.

You don't suppose
there's somebody still living here?

- [ Thunderclaps Continue ]
- We'll soon find out. Don, save the flares.

- We'll need 'em later.
- I'll get the flashlights.

Debbie.
Come on, Debbie.

We'll see if it's safe enough
to spend the night.

- Stay with us, now.
- Now, watch this.

- Lights?
- Yeah. Here.

- [ Don ] Will.
- [ Will ] Here.

Thank you.

Everybody all right
back there?

[ Debbie Chittering ]

Debbie, where are you?
Debbie?

Debbie?
Are you in here?

Debbie? Debbie!

Debbie, where are you?

Hey, Penny!

Penny, come on out!

Penny?

- Debbie?
- Hey, Penny!

- Will, Debbie's gone!
- You women are always gettin' lost.

Debbie! Debbie,
where are you?

Are you here?

- Hey, look. Pictures.
- We have no time for those.

- I've got to find Debbie.
- Wow.

- Debbie!
- Penny, help!

[ Screeches ]
Will, are you hurt?

- Stop fussing. I'm all right.
- Then get up.

- Where are we?
- I don't know.

[ Screams ]

[ Door Creaking ]

- We're trapped!
- Help! [ Screams ]

Will? Penny?

Look at this.

Will?
Penny?

[ Whistles ]

I guess they wandered into
another room. Come on.

[ Knocking ]

Shh. Listen.

- Will?
- [ Both ] We're here!

- [ Don ] Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

[ Penny ]
But look, Don!

- The door is closing!
- We're trapped!

Earthquake!

- Don!
- Judy?

- Will?
- Don?

- [ Don ] John!
- Penny!
- Where are ya?

- John!
- Don!

- [ Shouting, Indistinct ]
- [ Don ] We're over here!

- [ Screeches ]
- Hold on. Hold on.

- Penny!
- Don!

- Penny!
- Don!

- [ Screeching ]
- We're here!

[ Will ]
We're here! We're here!

- Judy!
- Don!

- [ Don ] In here!
- [ Judy ] In here!
- Judy!

- Don!
- Stand back!

[ Indistinct Shouting ]

[ Maureen ]
Judy!

[ Judy And Penny Screech ]

[ Maureen ]
Judy!

[ Screaming Continues ]

[ Chittering ]

- All right! Push!
- Okay!

- Throw a hand to it!
- [ Penny, Will ] Hard!

[ John ]
Push it! Push it out!

Hurry up!

[ Screeching ]

[ John Thinking ]
December 5 in the year 2001.

The attack of the fearful
lightning bolts...

followed by the equally terrible
earthquake, frightened all of us.

We're still puzzled by
the strange signs of civilization...

we found in the cave.

Either this unknown planet
once sheltered human life...

or mysterious beings
still lurk in shadows...

watching us
this very minute.

Perhaps, one day, we will return
to the cave and learn more.

Right now, we feel lucky to be alive
and are bending every effort...

to reach the inland sea,
our last barrier to the great tropics--

that promises warmth
and peace.

- It's working!
- Let's see.

- Don, look! It's working!
- I told you you could do it.

Will, you'd better get back there
and fasten your seat belt.

Well, there it is--
the inland sea.

Hang on.
It's a long way across.

Come on, now, kids.
Sit down.

Penny, could you get me
one of those protein pills, please?

- Mom gave us the last one
before we started out.
- I'm sorry, dear.

- We have some coffee pills.
Shall I heat one for you?
- I'm not about to fall asleep.

Will, if we're not on Mars,
you tell us where we are.

I don't know for sure yet.
We might even be on Cerberus.

[ Thunderclap ]

- What's wrong?
- It won't respond!

[ Thunderclaps Continue ]

We're not
getting any power!

Must be a loose connection
to the solar batteries!

[ Chittering ]

- I'll go up and see if I can fix 'em.
- Now?

- We can't risk it.
- Have to. Without power, we'll capsize.

- It's too late! We're right in the middle of it!
- Doc, we can't wait!

John, you know
he's right.

All right. Go ahead.
I'll try to hold her steady.

Will, stand in the hatch
and hand me what I need.

Okay.

Judy, up front.
Take over the scope.

[ Thunderclap ]

Give me the solar wrench!

Give me the solar wrench!

Here it is!

Don!

We're heading straight
for a whirlpool!

Don says there's
a whirlpool up ahead.

Judy, check the scope.
See what it reads.

We have no choice!
We must cut to the left!

I can't move it!

- We've lost control!
- I've almost got it! Wait one minute!

One minute,
I've got it.

John, look!
There it is!

I can't even
get it into reverse.

[ Screaming ]

[ Indistinct Shouting, Screaming ]

[ Screams ]

- [ Screams ]
- Get Don back in here and close the hatch!

Don?

Don! Don!

He's gone.
He's gone!

- Don!
- Judy, stay here!

- Don!
- Can you handle these?

Don?

Don! Don!

Don!

Don!

- Don!
- Stop it!

- [ Yelps ]
- He's gone!

- [ Judy ] Don!
- He's gone!

- [ Judy ] Don!
- He's gone!

It's gotta let up soon.

Help!

- [ Rapping ]
- [ Don ] Help!

[ Judy ]
Don!

[ Judy ]
We thought you were dead. Oh, Don!

Not dead.
Just half-drowned.

Try the power unit again.
I managed to make a connection.

Maureen, check the scope
for the nearest landfall.

All right, everybody.
Hang on!

Here we go!

[ John Thinking ]
December 8 in the year 2001.

Our great adventure in the wild sea
is now happily behind us.

At last,
we've reached the tropics.

The weather is warm,
the vegetation lush...

and the stillness of the air
promises peaceful days.

Yet so much has happened in our
short stay on this strange planet...

that we take nothing
for granted.

We've experienced dangers
unknown by earthbound men.

We breathe easily now,
but only for the moment.

Our every instinct
tells us there are wild...

wonderful adventures
just ahead.

Anything?

You keep asking if there's anything.

Pardon me for appearing desperate,

but before the pilot was ripped
from the cockpit,

he did say that no one's gonna find us
unless we get that transceiver working.

So... is there anything?

- No.
- Okay.

What were you doing
in the bathroom?

Thought you could tell.
I was getting sick.

Puking. My one tangible
contribution to the trek.

No, I'm glad you came, Charlie.




- Every trek needs a coward.
- You're not a coward.

- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm good, thanks.

- Can I get you a water or...?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

Please?

All right.

- Excuse me.
- Guess he really had to go.

Sir? Excuse me!

Sir, excuse me.

Excuse me.

Ladies and gentleman, the captain has
turned on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

Sir?
Are you all right?

Just a minute.

Just a minute.




I'm gonna have to ask
that you open the door.

Open the door now, sir.

Sir?

Hey. We're going through
some clothes. Sorting them.

I see you found your bag.

- Come on, you wanna give us a hand?
- Not really.

You're wasting your time.
They're coming.

Is that your boyfriend?

My brother. Boone.

God's friggin' gift to humanity.

I used to have a stomach.

- Do you know what it is?
- Not yet.

I haven't felt the baby move
since yesterday.

Excuse me.

Hey, uh, have you, uh...?
Have you seen my boy?

Sorry.

Walt! Walt!

Vincent!

Vincent!

Come here, boy.

Hey!

What did I tell you
after what's happened?

- I thought Vincent would be around.
- Stay on the beach.

I thought this would be okay.

Don't do that. You listen to me,
I mean what I say. You understand?

- What is this?
- I just found 'em.

Come here.

- Hey, guys, come on.

Hey.

Hey! Break it up!

- Break it up! Get off!
- Hey, come on, break it...

- You son of a bitch.
- That's it. It's over.

- Come on.
- That's it!

- I'm sick of this redneck!
- Want some more?

Tell everyone what you told me!
Tell them I made the plane crash.

- The shoe fits!
- What is going on?

- What's going on?
- My kid found these in the jungle.

This guy was in the back row
of business class the whole flight.

Never got up.
Hands folded underneath the blanket.

And for some reason,
just pointing this out,

- The guy next to him didn't make it.
- Thank you for observing.

Don't think I saw them pull you
out of line before we boarded?

- Come on! Bring it!
- Stop!

We found the transceiver,
but it's not working.

Can anybody help?

Yes, I might be able to.

Oh, great! Perfect.
Let's trust this guy.

Hey, we're all in this together.

- Treat each other with respect...
- Shut up, lardo.

Hey!

Give it a break.

Whatever you say, doc,
you're the hero.

You guys found the cockpit?

Any survivors?

No.

Dual-band. Military spec.

Chances are the battery is good,
but the radio is dead.

- Can you fix it?
- I need some time.

Doctor, that man with the shrapnel,
I think you should take a look at him.

Chain-smoking jackass.

- Some people have problems.
- Some people have problems. Us. Him.

You're okay. I like you.

You're okay too.

Hurley. Oh, just...

Sayid.

- How do you know how to do that?
- I was a communications officer.

- Oh, yeah? You ever see battle?
- I fought in the Gulf War.

No way. I got a buddy
who fought over there.

He was in the 104th Airborne.
What were you, Air Force? Army?

The Republican Guard.

Is it working?

It seems to be, except
we're not picking up a signal.

Why? Aren't we
trying to send one?

Yes, but what you want
to see here is little bars.

The bars show
it's getting reception.

- We need the bars?
- We could broadcast blind,

hope that someone, maybe a ship
somewhere picks up our distress call.

But that would be a waste of the
battery, which might not last for long.

- There is one thing we could try.
- What?

- Get the signal from high ground.
- How high?

How is he?

Can you do anything?

- I can pull out the shrapnel.
- But you said if you took it out...

That was yesterday. I was hoping
he'd be at a hospital by now.

If I leave him like this
he'll be dead within a day.

If I open him up...

If I can control the bleeding,
and if he doesn't go into sepsis,

and if I can find some antibiotics,
he might be all right.

I'm going on a hike.

- Sorry?
- Sayid fixed the transceiver,

- But we can't use it, not from here.
- Wait.

You said we had to send a signal.

- You saw what that thing did.
- Yeah, I did.

What makes you think we're any safer
here than we are in the jungle?

- Wait for me. I don't know how long...
- Sayid said the battery won't last.

All right.

If you see or hear anything...
Anything...

Run.

- What's up?

- What, that?

What, eat that?

Dude, dude, I'm starving.

But I am nowhere near that hungry.

No. No. No, thank you.

No way. No.

The comic's in Spanish. You...

...read Spanish?
- No. I found it.

Tell you what, we get home...

...l'll get you another dog.

Hey!

- I need your help.
- Okay.

Help me go through the luggage. I need
any prescription medications you find,

especially drugs that end in "mycin"
and "cillin." Those are antibiotics.

What's this for?

What are you doing?

I think I was mean to him.

What?

He's that guy from the gate.

He wouldn't let us have our seats
in first class. He saved our lives.

Shannon, we're trying to clear
the wreckage. You should help out.

You're just being worthless over here.

- Being what?
- What do you want me to say?

- You're sitting staring at bodies.
- I've just been through a trauma.

We all have. The difference
is you've given yourself a pedicure.

You know what?

- It is easy to make fun of me...
- I wish I didn't waste my time.

I wish I didn't have a reason!
It is easy.

Screw you. You do not have
the slightest idea what I am thinking.

- No, you don't!
- Okay, Shannon, what are you thinking?

I'm going with them.
On the hike.

- Oh, yeah?
- Yup. I'm going.

- No you're not, Shannon. Shannon!
- I'd like to come with you.

- She's not going.
- The hell I'm not!

- This is what she does.
- You don't know!

Makes bad decisions
to upset her family, me.

Shut up and stop trying to be charming.
I'm coming with you.

- I don't know if that's a good idea.
- What are you, two years older than me?

- You're going, aren't you?
- Yeah. Are you?

- Yup.
- Yeah, I'm definitely going.

Look, everybody can come.
But we're leaving now.

You couldn't tell from that,
but she's really nice.

You decided to join us.

I'm a complex guy, sweetheart.

What are you looking for?

Some sort of blade.

How's your son?

Walt?

Yeah, I think he'll be all right.

- How old is he?
- Nine. Ten.

Ten.

Walt's more worried
about his dog than anything.

The dog was on the plane, so...

- Kids, you know.
- Is it a lab?

- Yeah.
- Yeah?

- I saw him yesterday. In the jungle.
- What? Where?

Over there...

...a couple hundred yards in or so.
He looked good.

What is it, like checkers?

Not really.
It's a better game than checkers.

Do you play checkers with your pop?

No.

I live in Australia with my mom.

You have no accent.

Yeah, I know, we move a lot.

She got sick.
She died a couple of weeks ago.

- You're having a bad month.
- I guess.

Backgammon is the
oldest game in the world.

Archaeologists found sets
when they excavated the ruins

of ancient Mesopotamia.
Five thousand years old.

That's older than Jesus Christ.

Did they have dice and stuff?

But theirs weren't made of plastic.
Their dice were made of bones.

Cool.

Two players. Two sides.

One is light. One is dark.

Walt...

...do you wanna know a secret?

No, thank you.
No, that's fine.

No.

Okay. Thanks.

- Mmm.

Oh, God.

I just felt it!

I just... Come here, feel this!

Feel this. Please.

Do you feel that?
That, right there.

That's a kick!

There, right there's a foot!

Oh, my God, wait,
he's moving around.

He. He.

I guess I think you're a he.

Okay. Wide open space.
Check the radio, see if we're good.

- We're not gonna have reception.
- Just try it.

- I don't want to waste batteries.
- I'm not asking to keep it on.

- We're blocked by the mountain.
- Check the damn radio!

We might not have any juice left
when we get to...

Oh, my God.

- What the hell's that?
- Something's coming.

Coming towards us.

- Come on, let's move.
- I shouldn't have come on this hike!

- Go, go!
- Sawyer!

- Let him go!

That's...

That's a big bear.

You think that's what killed the pilot?

No. No, that's a tiny,
teeny version compared to that.

- Guys, this isn't just a bear.

It's a polar bear.

You sure he's out?

He's out.

How do you know he won't wake up
when you yank that thing out?

I don't.

Hey, guy, you awake?

Yo! There's a rescue plane!
We're saved! Yay!

Yeah, he's out.

So, what do you want me...?

It's unlikely
he'll regain consciousness,

but the pain might bring him around.
If it does, hold him down.

Uh... I'm not so good
around blood, man.

Then don't look.

Yeah. But...

I'm not so good around blood.

Just do the best you can, okay?

- Don't look.
- Okay.

Dude.

- Hand me those strips.
- Dude.

- I need to get this bleeding stopped.
- I don't think I can.

- What? What's going on?
- Just hand me the strips.

Give it to me.
Don't even think about it.

Don't even think it. Hurley, hey!

Damn it.

- That can't be a polar bear.
- It's a polar bear.

Wait a minute.

- Polar bears don't live in the jungle.
- Spot-on.

- Polar bears don't live this far south.
- This one does.

Did. It did.

Where did that come from?

Probably Bear Village.
How the hell do I know?

Not the bear, the gun.

- I got it off one of the bodies.
- One of the bodies?

- One of the bodies.
- People don't carry guns on planes.

They do if they're a U.S. marshal.
There was one on the plane.

How do you know that?

I saw a guy lying there with
an ankle holster, so I took the gun,

thought it might come in handy.
Guess what, I just shot a bear.

thought it might come in handy.
Guess what, I just shot a bear.

- So why do you think he's a marshal?
- Because he had a clip-on badge!

- I took that too. Thought it was cool.
- I know who you are.

- You're the prisoner.
- I'm the what?

You found a gun on a U.S. marshal?

You knew where it was because he
was bringing you back to the States.

The handcuffs were on you.
That's how you knew.

- Piss off!
- That's who you are.

Be as suspicious of me
as I am of you.

- You are the prisoner.
- Fine, I'm the criminal.

You're the terrorist.
We'll all play a part!

Who do you wanna be?

- Does anybody know how to use a gun?
- I think you just pull the trigger.

- Don't use the gun.
- I want to take it apart.

There's a button on the grip.
Push that, it will eject the magazine.

There's still a round in the chamber.

Hold the grip,
pull the top part of the gun.

- I know your type.
- I'm not so sure.

Yeah, I've been with girls like you.

Not girls exactly like me.

Can I get you a refill?

- I'm fine with this, thank you.

You, sir, can I get you anything?
Cocktail, soda?

Just coffee, sweetheart. Black.

Coffee, sure.

You look worried.

I'd be worried too, I was you.

But you gotta stay positive, kiddo.

There's always that off-chance
that they'll believe your story.

I know I sure do.

- I don't care what you believe.
- Oh, I know that's true.

That has always been true.

You sure you don't
want some more juice?

Yeah, I'm sure.

Ladies and gentleman,

the captain has switched on
the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

I have one favor to ask.

Really? This oughta be good.

We should keep moving.

No.

Where is she?

Who?

Oh, now's a good time to check
the radio. Not before, but now.

- We're up higher.
- Yes, we are.

Bar.

Hey, we've got a bar!

- Mayday, Mayday!

- What is that?
- Feedback.

- From what? What would do that?
- I don't know.

I'll tell you what. This guy not fixing
the radio. The thing doesn't even work.

No. No, no, no, no, it's not broken.

We can't transmit because
something else is already transmitting.

- From where?
- What?

Close, the signal's strong.

Somewhere close?
On the island? That's great!

- Maybe it's other survivors.
- From our plane? How...?

- What kind of transmission?
- Satphone, radio signal.

- Can we listen?
- Let me get the frequency. Hold on.

- There's no transmission.
- Shut up!

- The rescue party, it has to be.

French. The French are coming! I've
never been so happy to hear the French.

I never took French.
What is she saying?

- Does anyone speak French?
- She does.

No, I don't. What?

What? You spent a year in Paris!

Drinking! Not studying!

Iteration 7-2-9-4-5-3-1.

- Okay, what's that?
- Oh, no, no, no.

- What?
- Batteries are dying.

- How much time do we have?
- Not much.

- I've heard you speak French. Listen.
- I can't!

Do you speak French,
because that would be nice.

- Iteration 1-7-2...
- That voice is weird. What is that?

Come on, come on.

- It's... It's repeating.

- She's right.
- What?

It's a loop. "lteration."
It's repeating the same message.

- It's a counter.
- Iteration...

- The next number will end 5-3-3.
- ... 9-4-5-3-3.

Does anyone know
what he's talking about?

It's a running count of the number
of times the message has repeated.

It's roughly 30 seconds long, so...
How long...?

- Don't forget to carry the one.
- ... 5-3-4.

- She's saying..."Please."

She's saying, "Please, help me.
Please, come get me."

Or she's not!
You don't even speak French!

- Let her!
- Shut up!

Guys, the battery.
The battery.

... 7-2-9-4-5-3-5.

- I'm alone now.

I'm... on the island alone.

- Please, someone come.

The others, they're...
They're dead.

It killed them.

It killed them all."

- That was good.
- Sixteen years.

What?

Sixteen years... and five months.
That's the count.

- What the hell are you talking about?
- The iterations.

It's a distress call.

A plea for help. A Mayday.

If the counter's right...

...it's been playing over and over...

...for 16 years.

Someone else was stranded here?

Maybe they came for them.

If someone came,
why is it still playing?

Guys...

...where are we?

Previously on Lost:

The others are coming.
They're coming for all of you.

You have only three choices.

Run. Hide. Or die.

All I can tell you now
is we do have a plan.

Yeah. Go in the jungle,
and get dynamite and blow open a hatch,

and then hide everyone inside.

Nitroglycerine
is extremely temperamental.

So we just...

Locke, maybe this isn't the best way.

It's the only way, Jack.




- I'm carrying one.
- Not gonna happen.

- This is not your decision.
- It is.

We'll draw straws.

We don't have time
to argue about who risks their life.

Looks like it's you and me, Kate.

May I hold him?

She has a head start.
If we leave now, we can catch her.

- Get him back, Charlie.
- I will get him back.

- Is this where Boone fell?
- The plane was loaded with heroin.

So, dude, what do you think's
inside that hatch thing?

Hope.

I think hope's inside.

Whoever named this place
Dark Territory,

genius.




Yeah. I saw it.

We gotta get out of here.

Locke! What are you doing?

Locke! Locke!

Jack?

Jack!

Locke!

- My God. Locke!
- I need the dynamite!

No, no. It's in my pack.

Go get it! Hurry! Go!

John. John, just hold on.

- Just let me go.
- What?

- I'll be all right.
- No!

- Let me go! I'll be all right.
- I got it! I got it!

Be careful unwrapping it.

All right.

- Now throw it in.
- No! It'll blow us up.

- Do it! Hurry! I can't hold him.
- Don't do this.

Throw it in. Now, Kate!

Hey.

Your wife...
wife made this for you?

Sun.

She sounded it out, huh?

- So you can learn English.
- Yes.

Yeah, I wish she made one for me.

So, what words are in here?

English words. What can you say?

Starboard.

Aft. Port.

Sail.

- Eat.
- Yeah, right.

She did you well.

I hope you know
how lucky you are, man.

Back in business?

Alrighty.

Hey...

...it's yours.

- Here we are.
- You.

What?

You.

Thank you. Thanks.

I made you some tea.

I'm fine.

Thanks.

Aaron is a beautiful name.

What does it mean?

I don't know what Aaron means.

- They will bring him back.
- Don't say that.

- They will.
- How do you know?

Because he said he would.

Charlie will bring your baby back.

- There!
- Charlie, wait!

See. Let me see.

- It's bleeding.
- We need to put pressure on it.

OK. Put pressure.

- Animal! What is she...?
- Keep the pressure on, like this!

She's been here for 16 years.
She's learned how to set traps quickly.

OK, let's have a look. It's too deep.

It's bleeding too much.
You have to go back.

I'm not. You have to fix it.

- I'm not a doctor.
- You're a soldier!

What do people do
when they get wounded?

I'm not going back
without that baby, Sayid.

Don't move.

- Gunpowder?
- Remove the towel, tilt your head back.

Remove the towel.

This is because I hit you, isn't it?

This is not going to be pleasant.

You ready?

One. Two. Three.

Man.

I need my car.

Twenty minutes?
Look, I can't miss my flight.

My mom's birthday's tomorrow.

Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on. Cool.

Some of us
have a bloody flight to make.

Excuse me. Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

Come on. Come on.

No. No. No!

Excuse me. Excuse me.
Look out. Coming through.

Excuse me. Excuse me.
Look out! Excuse me.

Flight 917 is now boarding at gate 85.

Flight 917 is now boarding at gate 85.

Any way we can hurry that up?
My mom's birthday's tomorrow.

Or... today. I don't know, I don't really get
the whole time change thing,

but I gotta make that flight.

I am going as fast as the system
will allow me, dear.

You are confirmed for seat 20-G.

However, the airline has a policy
that a man of your size

must purchase two tickets.

What? I didn't have to do that
on the flight out here.

Am I going to have to weigh you, dear?

Fine. Whatever.
I'll buy the one next to it.

- Alrighty. Here's two together.
- Book it.

Departure gate for flight 143
has been changed...

"Uh-oh?" What "uh-oh?"

It appears that
your flight is already boarding

in the international terminal.
This is the domestic terminal.

I don't think you're meant
to make this flight.

Sorry. Pardon me.

Excuse me. Sorry.

Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

Excuse me! Coming through.
Behind you. Look out!

Sorry. Sorry! Sorry,
this is an emergency. I gotta...

I gotta cut through.
Excuse me. Dude. Dude.

- Back of the line.
- Let me go ahead. I'm gonna miss my...

- You don't understand. This is...
- Back of the line.

Next.

Now?
You're taking the computer out now?

Hey! Old guy!

I'll give you 500 to borrow your scooter.

I just had a hip replacement.
I need this.

OK. Sixteen hundred bucks.

Excuse me. Excuse me.

Coming through! Look out.

Look out, look out. Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

Look out. Heads up.
Coming through. Look out.

Coming through. Coming through.

Look out! Look out! Hold it!

Hold the door! Hold the door!

Hold... Hold the door!

I gotta get on... this flight!

- Sir, the Jetway's closed.
- Please.

For the love of all
that is good and holy in the world,

let me on this plane.

All right, one second.

Hunter? This is Gina.
We've got one more.

Ta.

This is your lucky day.

Fifteen, 16, 23, 42, four.

You say something?

Nope.

I thought I heard 23.

Does that mean something to you?

- What?
- That number? 23?

The guy who called the feds on me
back in Australia

did it for a $23,000 reward.

Mean something to you?

Nah. It's just a number.

Better catch up. I can barely see 'em.

We shouldn't be
this close to each other, Jack.

If we blow up, we blow up.

What the hell was all that about
back there?

- What was what about?
- You asked to let you go.

That's right.

That thing was taking you
down the hole.

- It wasn't gonna hurt me.
- It was gonna kill you.

- I seriously doubt that.
- Look, I need for you to...

I need for you to explain to me
what the hell's going on inside your head.

I need to know why you believe
that thing wasn't gonna...

- I believe that I was being tested.
- Tested.

Yeah. Tested.

I think that's why you and I
don't see eye to eye sometimes, Jack.

- Because you're a man of science.
- Yeah.

- And what does that make you?
- Me?

Well, I'm a man of faith.

Do you really think all this is an accident?

That we, a group of strangers, survived.

Many of us with just superficial injuries.

You think we crashed on this place
by coincidence? Especially this place.

We were brought here for a purpose.
For a reason. All of us.

Each one of us
was brought here for a reason.

Brought here?

- And who brought us here, John?
- The island.

The island brought us here.

This is no ordinary place.
You've seen that, I know you have.

The island chose you too, Jack.

It's destiny.

Did you talk with Boone
about destiny, John?

Boone was a sacrifice
that the island demanded.

What happened to him at that plane
was a part of a chain of events

that led us here,
that led us down a path,

that led you and me to this day,
to right now.

And where's that path end, John?

The path ends at the hatch.

The hatch, Jack. All of it.
All of it happened so we can open the hatch.

No. No, we're opening the hatch
so that we can survive.

Survival is all relative, Jack.

I don't believe in destiny.

Yes, you do.

You just don't know it yet.

I'm sorry, sir,
but the special wheelchair that we use

for loading disabled passengers,
no one seems to know where it is right now,

and unless we find it,
I'm not sure we can get you on.

There's not another flight
till tomorrow.

I'm aware, but there's nothing I can do.

Look, I can get Michelle.
We can carry him on.

Mind if we carry you on?

No, that would be fine.

Here we go.

Here's your seat.

I'll get your bags, sir. If you need anything,
press the "call" button.

OK. Thank you.

Hugo,

take these extra sticks
back a couple hundred yards.

Me?

OK. Got it.

Be careful.

Can I have a flashlight?

'Cause the torch around the dynamite thing,
not making sense to me.

Kate, you run the fuse.

- Jack and I will rig the charges.
- OK.

- I turned it on a little while ago.
- Sayid said every hour.

Look, we're 15 miles out.
We could be here for weeks.

- If that battery runs out...
- The man said every hour.

- Nothing.
- Five minutes. No more.

Aye, aye.

Know what I like about you, Mike?

- You got the patience of a saint.
- Yeah? Why you say that?

I've seen the way he talks to you.

The way he runs around,
does whatever the hell he wants.

I'd have shown him the back of my hand
a long time ago.

- You would, huh?
- Hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink.

Is that what your father did to you?
Show you the back of his hand?

My daddy never got a chance
to beat me.

Shot himself when I was eight.

That why you wanna die?

What?

Since you told me you wanted on this raft,
I couldn't figure it out.

Why's a guy
who only cares about himself

wanna risk his life
to save everyone else?

Way I see it, there's only two choices.

You're either a hero, or you wanna die.

Well...

I ain't no hero, Mike.

That what I think it is?

Something's out there.

What the hell is that?

There's no footprints, no tracks.

This is it?
This is the black smoke?

- Where are they?
- I don't know.

She's here.

Danielle?

- You come out! Right now!
- Calm down.

Danielle, I can hear you. Come out.

Please. He needs his mother.

- They were not here.
- Danielle,

you have to give us the baby.

I just wanted my Alex back.

I thought if I gave them the baby...

It's OK. I know.

It's OK.

I got him.

There never were any others.

You started the fires yourself!

No. I heard them whispering.

You're a nut job. You heard nothing.

I heard them say
they were coming for the child.

The others said
they were coming for the boy.

You're pathetic.

Wire.

Hold that end.

Now the fuse.

I'll do it.

- That's as far as it goes.
- It's far enough.

I'll light it. You take cover.

There'll be enough burn time
for me to get clear.

- Hurley!
- Wait. Just a sec.

What was that about back there?

What was what about?

Putting the dynamite in your pack.

- I made a judgment call.
- We drew straws.

I'm not gonna let drawing straws
make decisions like that.

You had no right.

Everybody wants me to be a leader
till I make a decision they don't like.

You want to keep second guessing me?
That's your call.

There's something you need to know.

If we survive this,
if we survive tonight...

...we're gonna have a Locke problem.

And I have to know
that you've got my back.

I got your back.

Are we ready?

Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

No, no, no.

Stop! Stop, we can't do this.

Stop! Wait!
Stop! We can't do this!

Stop it! Stop it! We can't!

Stop, don't light it!
We can't do this!

We can't do this!
Stop! What are you...?

We gotta stop it.
The numbers are bad.

What are you doing?
Why'd you do that?

Wait! The numbers are bad!
The numbers are bad!

- The numbers are bad!
- Stop!

- No, we can't!
- Hurley!

- Get back!
- We can't. The numbers...

You gotta get back.
You gotta get back.

It's closer.
Give me the damn flare gun.

- Hold on.
- It's closer. I'm telling you.

I know, OK.
I've got one flare. One flare.

OK. I know.
You don't see anything.

What the hell are you expecting?
In case you haven't noticed, it's dark.

- What is it? Is it a ship?
- We don't know, little man.

Starboard? Port?

Port. Port.

What the hell am I supposed to do?

Han. You and Chewie
wanna slow down and talk to me?

- We have to fire the flare.
- We don't know what it is.

It could be anything. Junk.
We don't know if Sayid's radar works.

- He ever fix something that don't?
- It's moving away.

- Junk knows how to steer?
- We're moving. It doesn't mean...

Are you gonna give me the damn gun
or am I gonna have to take it?

What're you gonna do?
Shoot me?

It's almost gone!

Come on!

Please, God!

It's coming back!
It's coming back!

- Yes!
- Hell, yeah. OK?

All right. OK. I know it.

Ahoy!

Man, are we glad to see you.

What's going on? What are you folks
doing this far out here?

We were...
we were in the plane crash!

We've been on an island
for a month, man.

Plane crash, huh?
Well, how about that!

We were on an island... flight 815...
Hey, where are we?

Hey, it's a good thing we found you!

We survived, and there's
a whole group of people on the island.

- Well, ain't that something.
- Yeah.

Only, the thing is,

we're gonna have to take the boy.

What? What'd you say?

The boy.
We're gonna have to take him.

Hey, what the hell's going on here?
Who are you people?

Just give us the boy.

Well, all right then.

No!

- No! Walt, no!

Dad, help!

Dad, please. Help, Dad. Help me.

Help me, Dad! Please!

Walt! No!
