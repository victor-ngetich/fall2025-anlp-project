Scratch. Wampum.

Dough. Sugar. Clams.

Loot. Bills. Bones. Bread. Bucks.

Money.

That which separates the
haves from the have-nots.

But what is money?

It's everything if you
don't have it, right?

Half of all American adults have
more credit card debt than savings.

25% have no savings at all.

And only 15% of the population

is on track to fund even
one year of retirement.



Suggesting what?

The middle class is evaporating?

Or the American Dream is dead?

You wouldn't be sitting there listening
to me if the latter were true.

You see, I think most people just have
a fundamentally flawed view of money.

Is it simply an agreed-upon unit of
exchange for goods and services?

$3.70 for a gallon of milk?

Thirty bucks to cut your grass?

Or is it an intangible?

Security or happiness. Peace of mind.

Let me propose a third option.

Money as a measuring device.

You see, the hard reality is how
much money we accumulate in life

is not a function of who's president



or the economy or bubbles
bursting or bad breaks or bosses.

It's about the American work ethic.

The one that made us the
greatest country on Earth.

It's about bucking the media's opinion
as to what constitutes a good parent.

Deciding to miss the ball
game, the play, the concert,

because you've resolved to work and
invest in your family's future.

And taking responsibility for the
consequences of those actions.

Patience. Frugality. Sacrifice.

When you boil it down, what do
those three things have in common?

Those are choices.

Money is not peace of mind.

Money's not happiness.

Money is, at its essence...

that measure of a man's

choices.

Okay.

Well, we're really just getting
started looking at, uh, interviewing,

I guess you'd say, financial advisors.

Mmm-hmm. Sure. You're
doing your due diligence.

Mr. Byrde, we don't know...

Call me Marty.

Marty, we don't know that much
about stocks and investing.

Well, I kinda do.

I do. I just don't have
time to do the research.

We wanna be comfortable

with who we trust our money to.

Um-hum.

Um, well, tell me, um... what are
your... What are your financial plans?

Do you have a... a five-year goal?

Yeah, we would like to build
out our basement, ideally.

And we would like a pool.

We're not getting a pool.

We're getting a pool.

- He does this all the time.
- Pools are tricky.

Very difficult to, uh, recoup your
money when it comes time to sell.

As an investment... uh, they're poor.

Marty, gotta be in the city at 4:00.

- Yep.
- Leave in ten?

Yeah. Hey, come on in, meet the Hunkins.

- Oh. Hi!
- This is Liddell of Liddell & Byrde.

This is Bruce Liddell.

The Hunkins are just interviewing
financial advisors, so...

- Oh, so you didn't tell them?
- What about?

Okay. So, we handle 73% of
Northwestern's entire surgical staff.

- Wow.
- Yeah, that's our appointment.

So, due to that level of business, we're
about to stop taking on new clients.

There is an Edward Jones office on
Wacker I hear does a halfway decent job.

Or...

Marty, you tell me if
it's not too late...

then $5,000 would still
open an account here today.

And we'd be happy to take
check or credit card.

Okay.

Um... check?

Great. Great.

Nice to meet you two. Marty,
I'll see you in the car.

Yep.

Central location,
magnificent architecture.

I know for a fact I'm the
first person showing this.

So you guys are in for a treat.

Views of the Chicago River.
Room for expansion.

- Oh, my goodness, this is perfect, baby.
- The lease options are...

- Babe, not while I'm working.
- I love when you give me boundaries.

Oh, thank God. Marty, what do you think?

Don't you love it?

It's nice. Very nice.

- It's nice?
- Yeah.

Fucking nice? I'm in that
corner, you're in that corner.

Twenty people working for us.
Boom, boom, boom.

Two receptionists.

What kind of windows are these?

- The kind you see through.
- I don't know.

I mean, this is southern facing, right?

I mean, depending on their
performance rating,

the cooling bill will be 15,
20% higher in the summer.

Something to consider.

You wanna go call some
clients or something?

I think Marty and I need to huddle up.

- He's being a little bitch. Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

- Sure.
- All right.

Saw your computer screen.

Wendy catches you rubbing one out
to that amateur backdoor action,

she's gonna fucking
crap a toaster, dude.

What are you thinking?

You and Wendy been together how long?
Twenty years?

- Twenty-two.
- Twenty-two years.

Holy Christ, those threads are stripped.

- It's a long time.
- It's a long time. Liz... Liz...

Nothing's off-menu.

This girl's got a wink like a fox trap.

This is your future wife
you're talking about.

- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.
- That is enough.

Easy, settle.

Marty Byrde, you're my best friend.
I love you, I do.

But you're living a
tragically subdued life.

Mmm-hmm.

And how is it... How is
it we make the same bank,

and yet I can see my place
in Trump Tower from here

and you're driving a ten-year-old
Camry with cloth fucking seats?

Nothing wrong with that Camry.

And I do just fine, sex-wise.

- Oh, oh, oh, really? Really?
- Yeah.

Says the man watching DIY porn in
his office, with clients present.

Wow.

Now, be honest. When was the last
time you were really truly happy?

Oh, come on.

- Come on. I'm planning up.
- Okay, okay.

You got me. You got me.

Financial advisor's not my dream job,

but I am taking a fucking
bite out of the apple.

- Are you?
- Yeah.

Hey, check this out. Check this out.

Liz and I went here...

...last weekend. Amazing.

Amazing. Look at this.

- Lake of the Ozarks?
- Yeah. Lake of the Ozarks.

Southern Missouri. The
Redneck Riviera, baby.

I thought I was gonna hate the place.
Got there...

...almost pissed myself.

- Yeah?
- Seriously. This bad boy...

This bad boy has more
shoreline, literally,

than the entire coast of California.

- Look at that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on.

Every summer, five million cash-rich
tourists show up, descend on the place.

And it's got everything. Rich,
poor, bass boats, yachts, condos.

- You keep this. You hold on to this.
- This is mine?

Yeah, you put that on
your vision board. Okay?

This place, I'm telling
you, it's got everything.

My point is, you can buy land
right down to the waterline.

We invest, okay?

Use it as an excuse to
get out of the city.

Your mood improves,
probably your marriage.

Decision, boys?

- I think we'll take it.
- Nice.

No. What? No, we're not...

We're not... We're gonna consider it.

- We're not taking it yet.
- Mm.

Sometimes, we don't think
we're gonna like something,

but then you try it,

and then suddenly you realize
that you're having fun.

Think about your trampoline.

I mean, your father and I fought
about getting that for years.

And then, all of a sudden, what
happened? Next thing you knew,

the two of us were doing
backflips out there with you.

Mom, I don't want to go to the
dance and I'm not gonna have fun.

Look, if he's just gonna stand
around, why make him go?

It's a school dance.
Everybody stands around.

- You just don't want me there.
- I'm trying to help you, retard.

- Hey.
- You're the retard.

- Hey. Stop it, both of you.
- We don't use that word. You know that.

You know, maybe you should go.

Then you can wear your Minecraft
T-shirt and take your spear.

Oh, screw you.

- Stop it, both of you.
- Put that back, please.

Your brother is handsome
no matter what he wears.

- Give me that.
- Gotta put yourself out there.

Give me the clicker, please.
I was watching that.

- No, you're not.
- Yes, I was.

Give it to me and eat your dinner
and leave your brother alone.

Why do you always take his side? Not
like you ever say anything to him.

Not taking his side.
You're picking on him.

Okay, okay. Just stop.

- Can we reset this conversation?
- Yeah, let's do it.

How was your day?

How was yours?

My day was very exciting.

I went to Costco. And then
I went and got groceries.

And then I... I dropped
off the recyclables.

And then I took Jonah to the dentist.
And then...

Do not throw that out. Your
father might want it later.

- You want it?
- No, thank you. No.

- Okay.
- That's very exciting.

Didn't you get, um, groceries on Monday?

Um-hum.

- I need ten dollars.
- What for?

There's a fundraiser for Hannah Lawson.

Is she all right?

- She has psoriasis.
- Oh. Jesus Christ.

It's a disease, Dad. Like cancer, okay?

No. Is it?

It's itchy skin, honey.

There's no cure.

Right, let's save our money.

I mean, if they're close
to a cure for flaky skin

and your contribution's gonna put
a crack team of dermatologists

over the top, then I'm gonna pony up.

But until then, I'd like to
save my ten bucks. Okay?

I am not calling you one, but
why are you acting so dickish?

I mean, it is only $10.

One day, you're gonna work for a living

and you're not gonna like people
with hands in your pockets.

Charlotte, get the ten
dollars out of my purse.

- No, it's fine. Let her face fall off.
- It's...

- It's ten dollars. For God's sake.
- What?

She asked me for $20 last week
and $50 the weekend before that.

She's 15 years old. She needs
to know the value of money.

- Do you not agree?
- I agree.

Your Consumer Reports came today.

That's ironic.

- Thank you for dinner.
- I worked hard at it.

...some of the dangers, and
we wanted to look further.

And while studies have shown that
potentially deadly side effects

are extremely rare,

fewer than 11 cases per 10,000
women who use it for a year,

families affected point out

that the incidence of life-threatening
blood clots is still double...

Do you want the History Channel?

Mm-mm. Thank you. I'm
watching something else.

I'm tired.

You seem awfully quiet.

Just got something on my mind.

- Do you care if I go to bed?
- Mm-mm.

- Good night.
- Good night.

- Who loves his little girl?
- You do, Daddy.

Good night.

Yeah, I got it.

You haven't done this before, have you?

Why?

Handsome.

Clean.

Fit.

Let me guess. Your wife won't
do what you want her to do.

If you were my man, working all
day so I could stay at home...

which, uh...

...let's face it...

it was a bitch when they
were little, but...

but now they're both teens
and in school all day.

Private school, too.

Even though you pay a
shit-pot full of state taxes

and live in a top-rated
public school district...

who's never missed a mortgage payment?

Marty Byrde.

Nice home on a quarter-acre
squared-off lot in the suburbs?

Marty fucking Byrde.

Putting presents underneath
the tree since 2002.

Not only would I not cheat on you...

...but I... I'd let you do...

...anything... you... wanted.

Do me a favor.

Don't come too fast.

Hey.

You can't be beatin' off in your
car, baby. It's a workplace.

Yeah. Thank you.

- Hello.
- Marty, it's Bruce.

I'm at Hanson's.

Trucking? Why?

I'm with Senior and Junior. I
need you here, Marty. Now.

Now? No, Bruce. It's the
middle of the night.

Tell me what the problem
is, and I can try...

Del. Del's here.

Okay.

Hey, Mr. Hanson. Hey, Bruce.

Hey, Marty. Del just has
a few questions. He's...

Yeah? What's going on?

Hey, Del. Didn't know you
were coming in town.

- You look good, Marty.
- Yeah, thanks.

Where's my $5 million?

Your what?

Your $5 million?

- What's he talking about?
- Have a seat.

Whatever's between you is your business.
Got nothing to do with me and my dad.

Shut up, son.

- We run a clean shop.
- Clean?

Other than the $100 million in drug
money that you and your father collect

and transport to these two
gentlemen to launder?

Clean to you.

Listen, Del. Wh... Whatever
money you're missing,

I'm sure there's a perfectly
good explanation.

No. "Stolen." That's my word.

Sit down.

Yeah.

Mr. Del Rio... I swear, we
are not stealing from you.

We log all of our weights.

Check 'em. The numbers don't lie.

Should tell that to him.

From Chicago to Panama,
Moscow to Tel Aviv,

Marty Byrde can make $100
million in dirty money

disappear like spit on a hot skillet.

Mr. Rio? I have to pee.

Of course.

When I was nine years old,

I started working for my
parents' grocery store.

Wasn't a big store, but it fed six kids.

We had four cashiers.

Carlotta, our best...

maybe 30...

started there when she was 15.

She was loyal.

The kind of person you call "Aunt"
when you're nine years old,

because she was always there.

Always with a smile.

And then one day, my
father's closing up...

and he sees Aunt Carlotta slip
five dollars' worth of pesos...

out of the till, into her pocket.

He could not believe it.

"Why? Why, Carlotta?"

"If you needed the money, why
didn't you just come to me?"

Carlotta was a proud woman.

Not too proud to steal, but... proud.

She had four kids, no husband.

Her youngest one had asthma.

Said she needed the
money to buy medicine.

So her boy could breathe.

Cried like a baby.

Swore she would never do it again.

Begged my father not to fire her.

Begged.

Mr. Hanson...

what should my father
do with Aunt Carlotta?

Five dollars?

You tell her if it happens
again, she's gone.

You put her on probation.

Probation.

I love America.

Bruce?

One mistake against 15 years.

Training cashiers is a bitch. I'd
give her a second chance, Del.

Marty, what should my father do?

I know what this is. I
know what you're doing.

This is an intimidation audit.

Yeah? I mean, you think you can
just come in here unannounced

and rattle some cages, and
someone's gonna admit to skimming?

I mean, you're fishing.

And, I mean, people steal. I get it.

But you got a distribution
chain downstream

that's run by meth heads
and drug dealers.

That's where you're gonna find your
Aunt Carlottas. They're not in here.

We've been laundering money for Mr.
Navarro for ten years?

That's right.

The only thing you've done here is
you've involved a civilian. All right?

And, you know, to be honest, this, uh...

Dale Carnegie-Pablo Escobar ruse?

I think that that's beneath you.

- Come on, Del.
- Ruse?

- Ruse.
- That's a good word.

Muchachos!

- What the fuck?
- Put it down!

- Jesus Christ!
- Whoa! Just slow down, Del!

- What the fuck?
- Shit!

Liz!

- Look, my dad had nothing to do with this.
- God, Marty!

- It was Bruce's idea.
- Hey, shut the...

Shut the fuck up!

- He came to me. It was Bruce.
- It was Bruce.

- It was his idea.
- Hey! Shut...

Del! What have you done, Del?
Goddamn it, what have you done?

Please, listen. Listen to me.

You don't wanna do this. Tell me...

Goddamn it!

He... he made a terrible mistake.
We will work for free!

Please, please, my dad had
nothing to do with this.

You know what I like about Chicago?

All the Mexicans.

Culture, the food, the language.

The women. I feel at home.

You know what I dislike about Chicago?

All the fucking Mexicans.

Might as well put up a sign that says,

"Welcome to Chicago,
drug hub of the US."

FinCEN, DEA, ATF, FBI...

all circling like buzzards.

And where does all the drama come from?

Hmm?

Four sticky-fingered white men.

Del, he's my son.

Please. He made a terrible mistake.

I can make this right.

I swear to God, I can make it right.
I... I can make it right.

A father shouldn't have
to see his child die.

- Dad!
- No!

How'd you do it, Bruce?

Hey.

Hanson's men picked up
the shipment of cash

along with whatever legitimate load.
Air conditioners.

Subtract the weight of the cash
from the weight of the trucks...

We rigged the gas gauges.

They'd read full when they
were five gallons light.

How much, Bruce?

Eight million over three years.

Okay.

Ready?

Marty had nothing to do with this.

This is all me.

I need you to understand...

I... I would've never done any of
this if I thought it would hurt you.

And I am...

Let me just say goodbye to my kids.

They're asleep. And I'll just...

I'll just leave them
a message, you know.

And they're confused...

...and worried about me.

Hang on one second. I'll
just leave a message.

Tell 'em that I'm going away somewhere
and that I'm gonna miss 'em.

They know.

- Where are they?
- Huh?

Are your kids in school? Summer break?

What?

Your kids, summer break?

I don't want to do Wendy
in front of the kids.

Wendy doesn't know
anything about what I do.

I never told her about
anything that I do. Not once.

Not once. You don't need
to do anything to Wendy.

- Are we ready?
- No, no, no. No, hang on. Hang on.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
One second.

Just talk to me for one second.
Just hang on a second.

Um...

More shoreline...

More shoreline than the
whole coast of California.

Excuse me?

This place right here
has more shoreline...

than the whole coast of California.

And apparently, every summer...

Hang on, listen to me.

Every summer, the population
of this place explodes.

Tons of tourists. Midwesterners
from all over the place.

Blue-collar, white-collar,
loaded with cash.

Okay?

That's why I got this brochure.

- I gotta go.
- Hang on, one second.

I got this brochure last
week, scouting businesses,

and I brought it back to
talk to Bruce about it.

And I was gonna talk to you,

because I wanna put the
house on the market,

and I wanna move down
there with the family,

and I wanna do what we do down there.

You're right about Chicago.

You got the FBI and the ATF and the CIA.

And they're all... They're
circling around Chicago.

And they're tapping phones, and
they're monitoring bank accounts,

and I just...

We need a new hub. I need a new hub.

Okay? This place...

It's away from every single law
enforcement agency in the US

and it's cash rich. Okay?

Think about it. I mean, what do I do?

I launder ten percent of what the
cartel does in the US? Right?

And even if you piecemeal five
percent off to some other guy,

you know, which I doubt you
do, but even if you do,

that's 85% that's getting shipped
across the border into Mexico.

All right? And how much of
that is getting seized?

A lot. It's a waste.

How much of it is getting
siphoned off to,

you know, bribe the border patrol guys

and-and the Cops,

and the politicians and the
judges and all that stuff?

It's all going out the window.
Just give it to me.

I want more than just the ten percent.
I want it all.

And I wanna take it down there. Okay?

What did these guys take from you? Was
it eight? Is that what they said?

I'll get you that. I'll put that
together. I'll make you whole.

You call it earnest money, okay?
I give that to you...

but then I take me and my family
and we go down to the Ozarks,

just like I planned.

And I just start washing money.
Tons of it.

Nothing but washed money.
That's all that matters.

Come on. Come on.

Five years,

three years, and I'll launder
twice what we're doing right now.

Five years...

$500 million. I can do that.

It's got more... more shoreline

- than the whole coast of California.
- You said that already.

- Here we go.
- Come on.

$500 million in five years?

Hey.

$500 million in five years?

Yeah. No question.

You have 48 hours to get me my money.

- Okay.
- Cash.

No financial instruments, no wire
transfer, no cashier's checks.

- Cash. All of it.
- Cash. I understand.

After I have my money...

you have another 48... to be
on the road to these Ozarks.

I want you to be ready to
set up shop within a week.

Yeah.

And, Marty... when I
drive by your house...

there better be a "For
Sale" sign on your lawn.

Come on.

No. There is no choice here.

Marty, stop. We have to call the police.

I want you to forget it, okay? I...

Or do you want to just role-play it?

Okay, I'm Detective Whoever The Fuck,

and you're the wife of
the top money launderer

for the second largest
drug cartel in Mexico. Go.

I mean, come on. Police mean jail time,

or witness protection program, at
best, if we even get that far.

If we make it that f... The
kids and I are in danger?

Well... What do you wanna hear?

You know, people who drive
trucks full of cash

onto scales to weigh it because
there's too much to count,

they don't exactly have a code
of ethics they adhere to.

We're not going to the police.

- Send Liz to the police.
- No.

No, Bruce didn't come home.
He's missing.

- They'll find out he's dead...
- Liz is dead, Wendy.

She's dissolving in a barrel next
to the one they stuffed Bruce into.

Now here's what I'm gonna do.
Over the next two days...

I'm gonna try to pull together $8
million to pay back what Bruce stole.

- What we're not gonna do is...
- Do we even have that much?

Well, it's gonna be tight.

I mean, after early
withdrawal penalties,

I don't know, but I'm gonna try.

What we're not gonna do,
though, is panic, okay?

We're gonna prioritize and
we're gonna compartmentalize.

And there's gonna be a little
bit of time management, okay?

All right? Starting
first thing tomorrow,

after we tell the kids we're moving,

we're gonna call your
friend Linda, the Realtor,

and we're gonna list the house.

Then you're gonna call a moving company.
Then you and the kids are gonna pack.

You can help 'em or let
'em do it themselves.

I don't really care, but
come Friday, after school...

we're on the road, okay? That's it.

And with the movers,
please, get three bids.

The money's gonna be tight.

- No fucking way am I going.
- Charlotte, you're going.

- We're all going.
- Not me. I'm gonna live with Caitlin.

The Ozarks. That's,
like, woods and stuff?

- Yeah, I think so, honey.
- Mom, what the fuck?

Husbands and fathers, and-and-and
mothers and wives...

they take new jobs, they relocate
with their families all the time.

You know, this country was built by
Americans pursuing opportunity, okay?

The pioneers, for one,

- relocated once a day.
- You're a financial advisor.

- A self-employed financial advisor.
- That's right.

You decide where the opportunity is.

Yeah, and I've decided the
opportunity is in Missouri.

- Okay, we understand...
- It's simple.

...that this is... this is upsetting.

Believe me, I get how hard this is.

But we're a family, so we are...
We're making this move as a family.

We would prefer if you would...

see it as an adventure.

Yeah, well, thanks for the
eggs and the shit sandwich.

Charlotte...

I got her.

You okay?

Not some, all. Everything.
Liquidated, cash.

$7,945,400.

Sir, again, we don't keep
that kind of money on-site.

You... you can't just
have it wired here,

and then come by the bank and
withdraw it. Not in cash.

Whoa, whoa! Marty, stop.

If the markets are spooking you,
let's slide it into mutual funds.

No, I'll be back in six
months with twice the money.

I'm not explaining myself correctly.

Just because it says the
money is in your account

doesn't mean it's really
there, physically.

I know how the banking system works.

That's why I'm calling you in
advance so you can get it.

Your entire portfolio. Yeah, forget it.

Ten percent penalty for early
withdrawal, plus another 32% in taxes.

Mr. Byrde, there seems
to be a disconnect

vis-à-vis large wire transfers

and your expectations about
withdrawing it in cash.

Sir, by the end of business today,

you're gonna have close to $8 million
in four separate accounts at your bank,

and I suspect that that puts you in a
woefully undercapitalized position

relative to your
obligations to the FDIC.

Okay?

So, you know, unless you're the vice
president of the one institution

that is exempt from the
liquidity ratio laws

that govern every other bank in America,

I suggest you place a call
to the Federal Reserve

at 230 South LaSalle,

and you order yourself up
a shit-pot full of cash.

Hey, Brenda, um...

Yeah? Do you need help with something?

This firm has been
dissolved, unfortunately.

I'm sorry?

The firm. It no longer exists, okay?

Uh, but, um...

you know, you were great.
All the way through.

Marty's in business with
some very bad people.

We need to leave town.

Your husband, the financial advisor?
Mr. Consumer Reports?

- Holy shit.
- We leave tomorrow.

What? Uh, wait a second. Wait.

Are... are we talking about
run-for-your-life kind of leaving?

Or a witness protection situation?

Everything's on the table.

Holy shit.

Holy shit. Leaving... leaving for where?

The Lake of the Ozarks.

The Ozarks?

I mean, good Lord...
what is that even like?

I think it's where camouflage
is a primary color.

His name's Gary Silverberg.

He's a partner with McNeil-Roberts
downtown. Know him?

Uh-uh.

On the board of half a dozen nonprofits.

Academy of the Arts,
Goodman Theater, Joffrey.

He sees your wife at least twice a week.
Sometimes more.

Either his place or
somewhere closer to yours.

An Hi Express, Fairfield Inn.

The DoubleTree in Alsip's
where I tagged 'em.

This "Sugarwood" right there.
What is that?

Ah, you jumped the gun
asking to meet today.

Normally, I transfer everything from
a working file to a folio binder.

Table of contents, intro, summary.
Suitable for presentation, arbitration.

Yeah, tell me what it means.

Sugarwood's her pet name for him.

- As in, you know...
- Ah, right. I got it.

- "Give me some of that sugar." Yeah.
- I got it. Thank you.

Well, where is Marty now?

He's paying back the money
that his partner stole.

How much, I don't know.

Well, if we're talking
about what I think we are,

the government will try to attach
as much of that money as possible,

freeze your assets to
force his cooperation.

You need to get as much as
you can as fast as you can.

Fuck.

Fuck! Fuck!

Hypothetically, scale of one to ten,

how difficult would it be
for someone to disappear?

You or him?

Careful.

No. Just me. You know, and the family.
Family of four.

New IDs, social security numbers,
credit cards. You could do it.

For a while, anyway. Then
your money'd run out.

One of your kids will get online sloppy.
Twitter, Instagram...

Your wife has one Lemon Drop too many

with her new best
friend, wants to share.

Yeah.

If you have a legal problem I'm not
aware of, don't tell me if you do,

you could keep your identity,
leave the country,

go somewhere with no
extradition to the US.

Depends on who's looking for you,

how much money they have.

Hang on. Hang on.

I just got a text from my bank. My wife
emptied our checkings and savings.

You got a gun?

- No. What?
- Good.

Silverberg lives in the Aqua Tower.

Apartment 8003, 80th floor.

What makes you think she's there?

It's Thursday.

Hi, this is Wendy.

- Leave me a message.
- Fucking bitch!

Hey, Gary?

Hey, Gary, I'm back!

Twenty-two years!

Never cheated. Not once.

And I had the chance...
more than a few times.

But I never ever took it.

Instead, I worked.

Came home, went to bed, got
up, did it all over again.

Not good enough, huh?

And now you want to try
to take our money?

You want a divorce? I will
show you the meaning of ugly.

You will lose. I will lawyer up.
I will dig in. I...

Whoa!

Whoa, man.

Come on.

Damn!

Wendy?

Why does Wendy have a cashier's
check for $29,650, Marty?

You lied to me, Marty.

She knows about our business.

What kind of man isn't willing
to lie to save his wife's life?

Was that before or after you found
out she was fucking the lawyer?

After.

Ouch.

I bet you haven't even
confronted her yet, huh?

Right now, you're
calculating the smart move.

Divorce her...

things turn ugly...

...she holds what you've
done over your head.

Live with the cheating,

and whatever man you think you
are is eaten away, day by day.

Or I take care of our Wendy problem...

right here... right now.

Your call.

Marty, you there?

What should my father do?

Your father?

About Aunt Carlotta. You
never answered my question.

What should my father do about
a woman who steals from him?

A loyal woman. A mother.

With him 15 years.

What did my mother make him do?

Fire her.

Why?

It's not the first time
she stole from you.

What was it?

It's the first time you caught her.

You're welcome.

- Hi. Good morning.
- Mr. Byrde.

Hi. What's this?

- Good to see you, Sir.
- Yeah, good to see you.

- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

Am I under duress? No.
What are you doing?

No. There's been... No, stop that.

There's been no kidnapping.

I'm not wearing any wires. I just...
I have a, uh...

a business opportunity
that requires cash.

- Sir.
- Yeah?

There's no business opportunities
that require that much cash.

- Not legal ones.
- Well, I agree to disagree.

Where's my money?

As we told you, we can't cover
that amount within 24 hours.

Okay.

There's two federal agents here.

Which means you wouldn't take the
chance that there was a kidnapping

and not have my money.

So if you don't produce it immediately,
I'm gonna walk into that lobby,

and I'm gonna tell these people
that I can't get my money out.

And we'll see how long
that takes to go viral,

and you get a good old-fashioned
run on this bank.

And if I want to put all
$7,945,400 into a hot tub...

get buck naked and play Scrooge McDuck,

that is 100% my business.

Now, where's my money?

The Great Depression.

That's when the Lake of the
Ozarks was built. 1929.

But you know all that.

You're Marty Byrde.

And Marty Byrde has been planning
this for a long time, right?

How long again?

Long time.

Yeah, I'm short. $6,950.
But it is not...

- It's not a problem.
- What did I tell you?

I've already sold that car,

but I also have a minivan
that I haven't sold yet.

And this... It's a Honda Odyssey.
It's...

it's top-ranked minivan in the US.

Blue Book on it is $27,000
and I get the cash...

I'll buy the Odyssey from you for 27.

So I owe you 20,000.
Take that from the cash.

And I'll lease it back to you for...
say, 1,000 a month?

Top-ranked minivan in the US.

Okay? Good.

Now I want you to take my
$7,973,000 with you to Missouri...

and clean it.

- Clean it?
- Mmm-hmm.

It's... That's clean.
It's already clean.

You want me to clean it? Again?

You'd lose 15%.

Another 25% in taxes. Minimum.

That's not the point, is it?

I have to see that you can do it.

I'm torn, Marty...

between intrigue and thinking
this whole Ozark thing

is complete and utter
straw-grasping bullshit.

But I'm willing to roll the dice.

Because you're special.

You have a gift.

But if I think that you're
trying to fuck me...

I will have to kill you... and Wendy...

and Jonah...

and Charlotte.

And not in that order.

Yeah.

Put it all back in his trunk.

You know, Del, the other day you said...

"Where's my $5 million?" and Bruce
and the Hanson kid took eight.

Mm.

You were right. I was fishing.

I didn't know they stole a damn thing.

And you killed Liz on a hunch.

On a tell.

I've been working with you
and Bruce for how long?

You ever known him not to
constantly run his mouth?

What's really going on, Mom?

You know, Charlotte, it has been, um...

a real hard few days, so...

if there is...

anything in here that
you can just combine...

Okay. You're just gonna have to help
Mommy over the next few days, okay?

- Okay. Okay.
- Just keep a really good attitude.

And you have to trust us, all right?

I know we'll work this out later.
I really do.

- Okay?
- Okay.

Thank you.

- Went straight to voice mail.
- Hang up.

- You want me to keep trying?
- No.

Possible he ran.

Changed his mind. Took his
chippie and left the country.

Agent Petty? I think we got 'em all.

Well, 18 bugs went in. I want 18 out.
My name's on the req.

Yes, Sir.

- You don't seem too upset.
- It is what it is.

Liddell was our in.

You heard him. He would have been
a fantastic government witness.

Mexicans, Mafia, Muslims.

We all want to believe that these
people are more than they are.

And they're not. If they weren't...

...dealing drugs,

extorting businesses, flying
planes into buildings,

they'd be cleaning toilets.

They're not criminal geniuses.

They're pathological liars on
the path of least resistance.

Liddell was no different.

Entertaining, though.

Uh, I'm confused.

Del Rio, Navarro, the cartel.

Why... Why would we do all this
if Bruce was just "entertaining"?

Where is Martin Byrde?

- Where you going?
- Just gonna take a leak.

Get your asses down!

Get your ass on the ground. On the

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

Ah, fuck! Fuck!

Ah, man, why'd you make me do that?

Get your asses down! Stay down!

Keep your asses down!

- Bullshit!
- I swear. I promise!

- They don't give me...
- Give me the goddamn money.

Come on!

There's only 50 here. Just
please take it and just leave.

Don't hurt me!

Whoa, whoa, wait. Whoa, whoa.

Take another step, I
shoot her in the face.

No, no, no, no, no.

This isn't ending the way
you thought it would.

Stay the fuck back.

- You understand?
- Yeah, yeah.

- I'm not fucking around with you, man.
- I got it.

- Stay back.
- This whole thing...

went south when you pulled the trigger.

Wallets, cash, jewelry, all of it!
Now! Come on! Let's go.

Stay on the ground, man. Stay
on the ground. Man, back!

Just because you made a mistake doesn't
mean you can't turn this around.

No, no, no, no. Hey,
wait, wait, look at him.

See, he's gonna make it.

Right now, you've got a second chance...

down the road. But if
you commit murder...

you're gonna go away forever.

- I'm not fucking playing.
- I know you're not.

And I know you got this rage inside of
you that you gotta... put somewhere.

Just put it right here instead.

You're a fucking psycho, you know that?

- Hey. Fuck. Fuck!
- Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

Calm down. Look at me. Look at me!

Mason!

Ash is here to help with the boat.

I'll be in in a second.

How do you know that's Bobby Dean?

Because I've sat with him.
Pretty sure that's Bobby Dean.

Well, what distinguishing
feature are you seeing here?

- Please don't argue with me.
- What? What, his eyes?

Look like they've been
sucked out by fish.

How about his fucking blue
knockoff Gucci shirt?

Somebody left him here on purpose.

- We have to call the cops.
- No, we're not doing that. Forget it.

- There is a body at our dock.
- Yeah.

It's the body of the man whose business
I just took over. Think about it.

Okay.

Why don't we just go inside?

We could just pretend we
didn't see it, and we...

- Stop poking him.
- No, we push him.

- Wendy!
- Are you guys okay there?

Yeah!

Nice work.

Waving your big fluorescent oar around,
attracting a bunch of attention.

- Got that?
- Got 'em right here.

Well, you can't possibly think
I'm dumb enough to kill someone

and put the body at the end of my dock.

Well, trust me when I tell
you, I've seen dumber.

My dealings with Bobby
Dean were amicable.

I offered him an above-market
price for a failing business.

Well, this place has a
history of chewing up men

who come in here thinking
they're smarter than us.

Far more formidable men than you.

I expect to see that bill of sale
on my desk first thing tomorrow.

Everything all right?

Thought I'd introduce myself.

Jacob Snell.

Hi, there. Martin Byrde.

I've come to understand that you're
the new owner of Lickety Splitz.

- Oh, yeah.
- Congratulations.

Thank you.

Not sure if you're aware, but...

previous owner and I, we had
a business arrangement.

Benefited us both greatly.

The folk who thrive around here

make a point of easing
their neighbor's burden.

Is that right?

I figured you'd wanna continue
with this local tradition.

Unfortunately, I don't think
that my employer would allow it.

You haven't heard my terms yet.

Business is business.

Yeah.

Good talking to you.

You too, sir.

Thanks.

I got it.

- Thanks.
- Yeah.

Let me help.

That's okay, Vineyard Vines.

You're really not
supposed to be back here.

Okay. Just trying to be chivalrous.

Ah, chivalry's dead. Haven't you heard?

Uh-huh.

- Hey. Change this for me?
- Yeah?

Uh, okay.

You from Chicago?

Uh, yeah.

- Highland Park.
- Naperville.

Ah, the Naper-thrill. Nice.

I'm Zach.

Charlotte.

Okay.

You gotta... See, here,
that goes in there...

So you live here? Now?

Uh, only for the summer.

Hmm.

So is there any chance I can
get you to the party cove?

Gets pretty wild on a holiday weekend.

Uh, I wish, but I'll be
chained to that dock.

I see. Thanks.

How much do I owe you?

Uh, you know, I'm not
usually back here, so...

I have no idea.

Well... keep the change.

Hope to see you around.

All right, we're good to go.

Party cove, here we come!

Yeah, I'm over here!

Hey, there you are. Um...

do you have any idea why everyone's
staring at me out there?

They think you killed him.

- They think I killed Bobby Dean.
- Mm-hmm.

Great. That's great.

Yep. First I heard it from
Fats when I got my smokes.

Who's Fats?

You know, the guy from the liquor store.

No.

And then Mary mentioned it at breakfast.

- Mary?
- You know, the waitress with the teeth.

Okay. This whole town's like a
big fuckin' game of telephone.

Yeah, except Mary said that...

they just saw Bobby Dean's
head floating in the water,

just bobbing all like...

Mm-hmm. Well, what'd you tell them?

I told them Bobby Dean didn't have
a nice body anyway. Man tits.

Okay. Well, obviously,
I didn't kill anyone.

I know. If you're a killer,
then I'm fucking Snow White.

- And I don't see any dwarfs around.
- Right.

So, listen, Ruth, um, I need you to, um,

take care of things around
here for a little while.

Can you do that? Run stuff?

- Me?
- Yeah.

Just through the holiday weekend.
I gotta work at the Blue Cat.

Well, it'll be fucking slammed here.

I'll make it worth your
while, cash-wise, I promise.

You got any questions,
just give me a call. Okay?

You'll be fine.

Who... who the hell said you could
come in here without my permission?

Did your pinko parents not teach you
the meaning of private property?

Huh?

- Is the lake a dangerous place?
- Is what?

Is the lake dangerous?

This about the body they found?

Well, dangerous is not the
first word that comes to mind.

Although, I've seen my share of bare
bodies bloated beyond recognition...

tourists turned to Swiss
cheese by propeller blades...

They usually ascribe it to ignorance.

But... I guess you can't discount the...

possibility of something
more sinister at work.

Is that why you have all these guns?

If that's what you wanna say.

My parents don't really like guns.

Why the hell did they move
here if they don't like guns?

You know, a kid can't pass
middle school health class

until he had his hunter's safety badge.

It was for work.

What kinda work?

My dad brings businesses back to life.

Well, wasn't the swamp thing on the
dock in business with your dad?

If so, looks like a mighty
dangerous place to be.

No.

I don't know.

Well, I've been here
nearly 30-odd years.

And in that time, every son of
a bitch I've seen move here

was running from something unsavory.

What were you running from?

You moved here, right?

What did you do?

Now, hold it still. You
let the barrel slip

'cause you weren't staring
through the shot.

You gotta keep aiming at the target
even after the smoke clears.

Yes!

Now that's what I love about watermelon.

They...

...approximate the water
content of a human body.

Not that I advocate that, but...

Did you know a sacrifice fly

doesn't affect batting
average, but lowers OBP?

So, at bat did happen, but
didn't happen at the same time.

Jesus, Tuck. How do you
remember all that stuff?

I don't know. I just do.

Here, throw this out for me?

- Whoa! Easy, Pacquiao.
- I just wanted to say sorry.

- All good. It's just about healed.
- No, for my freak show of a mother.

And the punch you deserved, but a
dead animal's just disgusting.

Well, uh, apology accepted.

Uh... And, I'm... I'm really sorry

- about all that stuff, too.
- Well...

Should've known I wouldn't come
at you with my right. Not again.

Why? Is it, like,

good manners to put the second
black eye on the other side?

Uh, I don't know about manners,
but symmetry is more attractive.

See ya.

You know that Bobby Dean had enemies?

Most assholes do.

People that would pin
a murder on someone?

You mean the someone that
stole his strip club?

Oh, please. I paid a fair price.
A lot more than I needed to.

Okay, I am starting to get the
feeling that there is more to you

than meets the eye, at
least more than good hair.

And I'm not sure how I feel about it.

Mm. I'm a businessman, Rachel.
That's it.

Yeah, look. I have no idea what
Bobby Dean was into, okay?

I avoided him like the
clap when he was alive

and I don't see why that should
change now that he is dead.

But here's what I do know.

You, being here, being
visible to customers...

I'm not sure that's good
for business right now.

You should stay away.

Oh, yeah?

At least, you know,
camp out in the office

or something till this gets sorted out.

Yeah, fine. Although, let
me ask you a question.

Uh, what do you know about the name...

Snell?

Well...

they've lived here as long
as anyone can remember.

Moved up into those hills
when the dam was built.

Lake swallowed up their
ancestors' graves.

Folks tell all kinds of tales
about the devious things

that are going on on that farm, but
who knows what is just urban legend.

How'd Bobby look when
they fished him out?

Like a peeled pumpkin.

Mm. Let that be a lesson to you, Ash.

Never trust a redneck when
you need the job done right.

- Yes, ma'am.
- And this Byrde man...

Martin Byrde.

Said his employer wouldn't allow it.

His exact words.

Even after he saw the body?

I watched Sheriff Nix fish it
out right in front of him.

All of which means he's more afraid
of his boss than he is of us.

Only question is, does
he have reason to be?

Ash!

Now, you know what you need
to do for us now, don't you?

About Mr. Byrde.

Yes, ma'am.

- Best get to it, then.
- Yes, ma'am.

Another nest?

Mm-hmm.

Every one we've found so far
has been up in the hills.

Way above the waterline.

We must be due one hell of a storm.

It'll start before sunset.

Guess we won't have to water the crop.

This is Josh Silverberg. I believe
you knew his father Gary?

Josh has some questions
about his father's suicide.

Nice to meet you, Josh.

Leave you two to talk.

I am so sorry about your father.

It was pretty easy for me
to find you, actually.

You were all over my
father's Facebook page.

What kind of questions?

Why'd you hang up on me when I
called you from my father's phone?

Seems like a pretty good place to start.

I don't know.

I guess I was surprised.

Yeah, I've been calling the detective...

who's been working on my
father's case every day,

telling him that there's no way my
father could've killed himself.

- What does he say?
- That I'm wrong,

that I should talk to
someone, that I'm in denial.

Well, it's... it's only natural,
I mean, to search for answers.

When I was 16...

one of my best friends ended her life,
and my friends and I, we just...

- we couldn't accept that she...
- The detective is wrong. I know it.

Okay.

He was the happiest he'd been in years.

He told me so...

ten days before he supposedly threw
himself out of an 80th-story window?

I had just told him...

that it was over.

That I was leaving
Chicago with my family

to give my marriage a second chance.

I... I talked to my
father almost every day.

How... how come I never
even heard of you?

I don't know.

I have a family.

Maybe he was trying to protect me.

So you expect me to
believe that my father...

loved you so much that he...

- took his own life when you left?
- I'm just telling you what I know.

Did you love him?

I'm gonna jump in the shower, Rach.

Hi.

Sorry, I forgot it was Sunday.

Well, he's... Wasn't that
good if you were wondering.

His ego just needed a little boost.

So we're screwed for the Fourth
if this doesn't let up, right?

Old-timers like my grandma...

she used to call these big summer
holidays the "ruling days."

As in, these are the days that will rule

how we live the rest of the year. But...

I'm guessing Marty Byrde
already knew that.

I'm guessing he's not really
here 'cause of the rain.

Yeah. Things are a little, uh,
complicated at the house right now.

Well...

if anyone knows complicated, it's me.

Hmm.

Well, my wife's talking
to her dead lover's son.

Thanks. What about your...

- Fuck of the week?
- Yeah.

Yeah, well, company's better out here.

Thanks.

Hey, no lap dance for you.

Yeah... free money.

That was good. Huh.

Who the hell is that on the pole?

We needed to class the joint up
if we ever wanna make any money.

- And this was Marty's idea?
- Mm-mm. Mine.

I looked at our inventory and
I felt that it was lacking.

Don't get your thong in a bunch.

Competition's good for you.
It builds character.

Well, we all know why you're here.

What was that you said?

It's okay. Tell me.

Bobby Dean turns up dead,
and now you're in charge?

Don't deny it. We all
know who your daddy is.

Anyone else got shit
to say about my daddy?

Hmm?

Then get back to work.

We got a shit-ton of money
to make this weekend.

Well, what does he know?

Nothing.

Nothing? What the hell was
the kid doing here, then?

Why'd he drive all the
way down from Chicago?

Because he suspects.

Okay, what does he suspect?

And I'll need some specifics, Wendy.

He doesn't believe his
father committed suicide.

And he's talking to the police.

- Well, did you change his mind?
- I don't know.

- Then you didn't change his mind.
- I don't know.

- You would know, don't you think?
- I don't know.

And what was I supposed to do?

Kill him and throw him off the dock?

What did you tell him? What was said?
What did you speak about?

I told him his father was
heartbroken because I left.

What'd he say?

Where you going? Wendy?

He asked me if I loved his dad.

Oh, yeah?

What did you say?

That I didn't.

- Was that the truth?
- Yes.

Okay.

Been looking for you.

Checked out a couple of spots I know.

Water's running real good.

I thought you weren't interested
in fishing with me anymore.

Well, you planning on
paying me for my time?

Of course.

Money's money.

All right. Well...

just give me a call, then.

Here's that bill of sale you asked for.

You can see the final sale price
there and the date of transfer.

Next page, you can see the
certification, the... title transaction.

It's all there.

- Hmm.
- Okay?

I... I called the Chicago
PD earlier today.

Seems your business partner and
his girlfriend disappeared

just before you moved to my little
jurisdictional paradise here.

Mm-hmm.

You have anything to tell me about that?

Got nothing to say that we haven't
already told the authorities.

I'm gonna give you the simplest,
most neighborly advice I can give.

Whatever it is you're up to...

stop.

Sheriff, we're not up to anything, okay?

All right. Well...

Keep the bill of sale.

Bobby Dean had enough heroin
in him to kill a horse.

We're calling it an overdose.

Okay.

Was it an overdose?

Yesterday you seemed
certain it was foul play.

Well, we prefer to keep all options
open at the start of an investigation.

Enough heroin to kill a horse.

Not even the worst addicts
have that much heroin...

It was an expression.

Was it?

Let me... Let me make this very clear.

It's better for all of us if we
can just call this an overdose.

Understood.

You have a good day.

Holy Loretta! I can't believe
how many you just caught.

You know exactly where
you were taking me.

Oh, hell, yeah, I've been...
I've been there a hundred times.

That's my little spot.

It's a good little... little hole.

I will tell you this,

I have never seen someone catch
one, get it off the hook,

put it back in, and get another
one so fast in my life.

Well...

Oh! That's what it takes...

to be a professional, you
know what I'm saying?

Oh!

Oh, buddy.

Give me some of that.

Mmm. Mmm.

That is the best damn day in the
water I've ever had in my life.

- I know.
- Fuck!

Right?

Ah, shit.

Hey.

The fuck is wrong with you?

I'm sorry. I just got carried away.

Stay away from me, you fucking fag!

Faggot!

- All right. All right. All right.
- Get... get the fuck out!

The fuck out of my truck!

- All right. All right.
- Fuck you!

He knows.

He knows the Snells killed him.

Fucking sheriff and even
he's afraid of them.

Snells wanted us dead, they
would've done it already.

So don't worry. We just... We
just avoid their turf, I think.

So what exactly is their turf?

Well, fucking everything, right?

Probably why every single business
rejected me the second we got in here.

Now I got that dead body. No
one's gonna wanna work with me.

We're screwed. We got $4
million left to launder.

How are we gonna find enough
businesses to clean that much

without getting into a
war with these people?

Uh...

We have to build something of our own.

Flipping houses isn't
gonna do it, Wendy.

Could flip 50 houses, it's
not gonna make a dent.

- Then it has to be bigger.
- Yeah? Like what?

I don't know.

But you can move money
through construction costs.

- Yeah. It'd have to be massive.
- Yeah! Well, obviously.

Think lots of people. Lots of cash.

And no IRS.

Okay. So... so... so what is that?

- I don't know. You tell me.
- I'm...

Well, there's gotta be some business
the IRS is afraid to touch.

- Hello.
- Hi! We're the Byrdes. I'm Wendy.

- Hi.
- Hey.

- Marty. Hi.
- Mason.

- Hey. Grace. Hi.
- Hi.

- Thanks for having us.
- Course.

We can go out to the porch here.

Don't swim past that red buoy.

Boats come out of nowhere, they'll
sweep you up in their wake.

Take a month to fish out all your
tender little bits and pieces.

Not that I'd miss you...

but if you cost me the last good
month of boating in my life,

I promise I'll piss on your grave
every last day until I die.

Yeah, well,

what makes you think they'd find enough
to bury me before you drop dead?

So, uh, what drew you here?

Um, well, the work.

Right. Probably the work, mostly.
Thank you so much.

Sure. I meant... I meant
to our congregation.

Mm.

- Of course. Sorry. Um...
- It's okay.

Well, belief.

Hmm.

Um, some of the other members.
The pastor.

You know, I saw you... I
saw you preach one morning

just after we moved here.

Yeah, I remember. I saw you driving off

as if you were fleeing a leper colony.

Oh. Well, I was, uh...

You know, before we make
a decision on a church,

we wanted to make sure that
we researched all of them.

And all the gentlemen's clubs.

Yeah.

Okay, look, obviously we're
not the most religious people

- on the planet.
- Well, she speaks for herself.

I mean, the last time we were
both at a service was for my...

was for my cousin Skip's wedding
in a small chapel in Las Vegas...

That's right.

...that lasted longer
than the actual marriage.

But, look, whatever you might
think of our businesses...

- I don't think anything.
- Uh, you seem like someone who...

You really want to do
some good in the world.

And we can help you.

By building a church.

Oh.

Oh, I have a... I have a church.

You... you have a boat.

And before that, a sidewalk in St.
Louis. A church is not a building.

But it can be...

if you build it right.

I mean, the church that I grew up
in was in Boone, North Carolina.

Our preacher, he was this
70-year-old chain smoker.

He had this voice like a... like
a distinguished Foghorn Leghorn.

But he...

he managed to gather everybody
together and they built that church.

And every Sunday, after service, my
daddy, he would take me by the hand...

and he would show me the
nails that he hammered in.

It meant that much to him.

And once upon a time, it...

...it meant that much to me.

What made you stop attending?

I...

I don't know.

Uh, I mean, I don't believe that...
people actually need a reason

to do the things they do. I mean,
sometimes people just act.

And then they come up
with an explanation later

when they're looking back.
I mean, what...

what made you say, "This is my calling"?

Something happened to me. A
situation I put myself in.

You know, I've never really considered
myself to be a brave person.

I don't know why I did it.

It made no sense.

But something came over me...
afterwards.

I had the need to help people.

Hmm.

I think that's what everybody wants.

I think that's what
everyone's looking for.

- You know, to feel helpful.
- Mm.

And not just during the summer. And
not just people who own boats.

Let us help you.

I mean, we just want to pay for it.

But... but your congregation
should build it.

Let them learn what they're capable of.

there's only so much that...

- we can deposit through the slot.
- Yeah? How much we talking?

Eighty grand.

Very nice. You hired new dancers.

Yeah. I figured we can use
'em over the weekend,

but... we might as well keep them.
They're a big hit with the boys.

Well, that is your call.

- What do you mean?
- I mean it's yours, if you want it.

- The club?
- Yeah.

I'll run the books, you can
take care of the day-to-day.

I'll give you 1,000 bucks a week.

Or I can start interviewing managers.

Uh, no, no, I'll... I'll do it.

Good. I'll take care of this.

You keep it up.

So you just broke into his house?

Yup.

Ever heard of a library card?

You don't understand. This guy...

has got first editions like
you would not believe.

I doubt he even notices
anything's missing.

Look... first edition. I read
that when I was, like, 12.

Mm. Yeah, science fiction's
not really my thing.

Says everyone who's
never read real sci-fi.

It's about humans, right?

So in this, it's like
we're the Martians.

We're the aliens. We go to Mars...
take the place over,

wipe out all the Martians and,
like, try to make it our own.

But then we realize... it can
never really be ours, like...

even the people that were born
there, never known any other place,

they'll still always be aliens.

And the best part is, like, all
these people move to Mars,

try to escape their problems on
Earth, and they get there and...

it's like life on Mars
isn't any different.

Like, they just bring all
their old problems with them.

- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What the fuck's wrong with you?

You're here, you're playing.

Oh!

Come here.

- Oh, what the fuck, Wyatt?
- What the fuck to you!

Why am I the only one who acts
like an adult around here?

I'm 17. You're, like, fucking 40.

So?

So... fuck you!

Sure you don't wanna go
get lost or something?

Um, I don't know. But I would
like to use the bathroom.

Um, yeah. There's a really nice one
up the road I want to show you.

There something wrong with yours?

- No, it's just... guys.
- Yeah.

It's fine.

Just, uh... Just don't mind the mess.

Uh, bathroom's down the
hall, to the left.

Thanks.

You tell anybody about this,
I'll fucking kill you.

You really need to work
on your pillow talk.

I wanna increase our output
to three kilos a week.

Any reason why we can't
dry that much product?

No, sir.

And this preacher, he still
got no clue about this?

Nope.

- His wife?
- No, sir.

[Mason]
When Jesus chose his 12 disciples,

he knew that one of them was the devil...

one was Judas.

Yet he sat with them all
and broke bread still.

So what's the Bible telling us...

here? Um...

Well, as a minister, it's...

it's imploring me to embrace
those of you who might be...

doing bad things.

You have to understand
that Christ still loves you.

And that you can...

always change your life.
I'm here to help...

I'm here to...

[microphone feedback whines]

Um...

If everyone could pull their boats around,
Ash will be passing out the hymnals.

We'll turn to page 24.

"Do not participate..."

[whispers] "Do not participate
in the unfruitful deeds of darkness,

but instead even expose them."

"Do not participate...
in the unfruitful deeds of darkness."

[softly]
"Unfruitful deeds of darkness."

"But instead... even expose them."

The Bible says one thing,
and then it says something else.

I'm failing you. I...

- Preacher.
- You need to stop.

I need to distribute these,
and you need to keep preaching.

- Now, take...
- Don't fucking... touch me.

[indistinct chatter]

I need to talk to Jacob.

Service is over.
I'm sorry. Service is over.

I need to talk to Jacob.

[Jacob] Where are the hymnals now?

Preacher still with you?

Give me some time, then bring him here.

You were clear, and you have been patient.

- [indistinct chatter on police radio]
- [camera clicking]

[hollow thumping]

[Jacob] You've caused some upset
I had to deal with.

I couldn't do it.

I thought I could,
and then I saw their faces and I just...

I'm sorry.

I can't preach the word of the Lord,
knowing what I'm a party to.

It would be a lie.

I understand.

We're both men of principle, you and me.

Lose the power of our word, it's...

it's like we lose ourselves.

Ash, make sure the hymnals
are back in our possession,

then we can say our goodbyes to Mr. Young.

Wh...

That's it? Just like that, I'm free?

[Jacob] You were always free.

But you know that.

Life is all about choice.

And right about now,
all either of us can do is accept that.

You're getting sentimental
in your old age.

I should have done this
right when we got here.

[Wendy] Well...

things weren't exactly normal
when we first got here.

I guess normal is what we make it, right?

[chuckles] Jesus.

Guess I am getting sentimental
in my old age, huh?

- [crickets chirping ringtone]
- Hello.

[Jacob]
Preacher didn't let us do our job today.

Matter of conscience.

Now I respect his decision,
I do, of course.

He's gonna have to respect
the consequences.

[dog barks]

Uh, Jacob, I could talk to him.

Grace?

Grace?

[Jacob] No more talking.

Too much talk
and words lose their meaning.

[Marty] Hang on. Let me try.

[Jacob] It's done, Martin.

What's going on?

- What's done?
- Marty...

Kept my promise, plain and simple.

What the fuck does that mean?

Search your soul, Martin. You'll know.

[baby cries]

[Marty] Jesus Christ.

[Jacob] Life is simple, really.

It's all about hard work.

Honesty. Family.

Words have meaning
and actions have consequences.

Tell me Grace is okay.

[Jacob] Grace is past saving, Mr. Byrde.

It's your own family on the line now.

- [dog barks]

- [baby cooing]
- [shushing]

I don't believe this.
Do you really think she's dead?

Fuck. Last night must have spooked him,
otherwise he'd be gone.

- Don't look at him, okay?
- Okay.

He sees our eyes dart his way, he's just
gonna get suspicious. Look at me.

Uh, you gotta get the kids
out of here. Okay?

- To where?
- Anywhere. I don't care. Just away.

And where are you going?

[stammers]
I gotta get out in front of this.

When it's safe to come back,
I'll call you.

- All right?
- Mm-hmm. And if it's not?

Then you just keep going.

Oh, no, no, no. No, no hug.

It's just a normal day, okay?
Husband and wife.

- Right? I'll see you soon.
- Mm.

[Wendy whispers] Okay.

[engine starts]

[Jonah] I don't understand.

[Wendy] Grab a few essentials.

Just jeans, a T-shirt, a windbreaker,
and do not forget your medication.

- [Jonah] Is this okay?
- No. No, sweetheart.

No, not a suitcase. A backpack. Backpack.

[Charlotte] Where are we going?

Kansas City.

I don't want to go to Kansas City.

[stammers] No, there's a...
The Plaza's really nice there.

- Is this about last night?
- We'll talk about it in the car.

- I'm not going anywhere until you...
- Charlotte, just for once in your life,

just once, for the love of God,
just do what the fuck I say. Okay?

Go pack. Go. In a small bag.

Something you can throw over your shoulder
like you're going to the mall.

[Jonah] What about Dad?

I think you might've misunderstood
this dance first time 'round.

You pay a fine once.
After that, you accept the punishment.

I'm not paying a fine. And I'm not
asking you for your forgiveness.

I want to buy your product.
That's $300,000.

That's my estimate for the street value
of what was on the boat today.

Go on.

[inhales, sighs]

I take it you don't want to go back
to your old way of distribution?

Right? On land?

[Jacob] It puts a strain on our
relationship with local law enforcement.

Okay. Then if I can't solve your problem,
I'm prepared to be your sole customer.

Every week. The whole load. Furthermore,

I'm willing to launder the portion of
the profits that Bobby Dean used to cover.

Darlene?

I don't think the juice
is worth the squeeze.

My wife thinks nothing's been right

since you and your family
touched down here.

[Darlene] You've cost us sleep.

[Jacob] We've watched you a lot, Martin.
Your family.

I get the feeling you know
what it's like to be...

married to a woman
who's always sitting on impulse.

What would you do if that wife
who you love and respect...

felt that the smartest way to deal
with a problem was just to eliminate it?

I'm a businessman. I trust the numbers.

Mm-hmm.

Y'all hear the bell this morning?

Legend goes that when they flooded
my people out to make way for this lake,

they swallowed a church up whole.

You can still hear the bell
from under the water.

Certain people believe it's a sign.
A call to worship.

Others think it's a sign
that someone's gonna die.

Today, it was both.

Next time, it's up to you.

Yes. And we are staying together,

[Nix] You have any idea
why I have a preacher down at my station

holding a baby he's convinced that
you cut straight out of his wife's womb?

I got no clue. I...

barely know the man.

Sure as hell
ain't got no quarrel with him.

- [Darlene] Who found the body?
- Oh, we haven't found one yet.

- [Darlene] Well, where's the crime scene?
- We don't have one.

Witnesses?

No, ma'am.

Hmm.

Don't understand it. Ain't no logic to it.

Pastor Young says it's on account of him
refusing to run heroin for you.

So this preacher is a drug dealer?

He claims you were using him
without his knowledge.

Did you smell his breath?

I'd put money he was sober, ma'am.

[Jacob] Now you listen here, John.

When we planted poppies, first thing
we did was come straight to you

and make sure there could be
no misunderstanding.

- Uh-huh.
- If we were harvesting opium,

we'd have to cut the flowers off
before they bloom.

You see us at the market?
We sell mature plants.

I checked all the local hospitals.

No baby's been delivered in this area
in the last three days.

Well, you got your home births,
your midwives.

Now it sounds to me like this
preacher's wife abandoned their child,

and now he's gone around the bend.

We're talking about
a potential murder here.

If you're connected in any way...

it's my duty.
I'm gonna have to bring you in.

Absolutely. Absolutely it is.

Uh... I passed Martin Byrde
on the road coming in.

So... what sort of business
you have with him?

He owes us a debt.

- How big?
- Bigger than yours.

A single crematorium furnace

generates temperatures between
1,600 and 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

You were the one who said
you owned a funeral home.

Yeah, because you didn't trust
dumping a body in the lake.

Well, even if you puncture the lungs, they
still got a tendency to float up on you.

- Is that right?
- Uh-huh.

Soft tissue is vaporized, while bones...

You given any thought to what you want

Yeah. I wanna be buried, no casket.

[Rachel] Just a freak accident.

Boat must've pulled the wiring loose.
AC current leaked into the water.

Are you the one who wired the dock?

Uh, no, it was one of my workers.

Someone you hired? Or...

did Marty Byrde?

Why would you ask that?

Well, he's an investor here, right?

- Right. Oh, I know.

Missouri River is 2,500 miles long,

and you can still float an oil barge
all the way on it if you got a notion.

[Marty] Okay. And so that...
Okay. That's Snell's there. Yeah?

Great. And you're sure
all of this is Snell property, right?

Oh, it goes a heck of a ways
further than that.

I'll get another map.

[Rachel] Uh...

Sorry, we're closed.

I'm looking for Marty Byrde.

Well, he's not here.

Are you cold?

You're shaking.

Oh. Yeah, we had an accident
on the dock a couple nights ago,

and two men died,
so I'm just a little upset. [chuckles]

Anyway, um, you know,
we'll be open in a couple hours,

if you wanna stop by then.

I'll leave you to your work.

Oh.

Uh, should I tell Marty who stopped by?

No. I'd rather surprise him.

[door closes]

[Petty] I fucking got that motherfucker.

[Evans] I told you,
I don't see how this works.

Well, we're gonna figure it out.

We don't have anything
to arrest him on.

- Then we're gonna make something up.
- Are you drunk?

Nope. I'm enlightened.

Del Rio's got a clean sheet.

That... that's why they use him to travel
back and forth. We can't touch him.

Jesus, what fucking box factory
are you working in?

The same one that'll take away your badge
if you try to make a bust without cause.

You need to stop worrying about the law.

That's a joke, right?

Right now, the only things that matter
are leverage and perception.

- How do you figure?
- We need to get Marty Byrde on anything,

so that he knows he has no other choice
than to turn on Del Rio and the cartel.

- I understand fucking leverage, Roy.
- So, perception.

If we drag Del Rio in here on anything,

it does not matter what it is,
it doesn't have to stick,

so long as we know that he sees
that we're holding Marty Byrde, too.

Then Del Rio will get spooked.

Yeah. And Marty will know
he has to cooperate for protection.

Otherwise, he's a dead man.

- [Three] Hey, you might wanna see this.
- [Ruth] What happened?

- [Three] Just get over here.
- [Ruth] What?

What are you doing?

Wyatt fucking Langmore,
what're you doing? What the fuck!

Hey, stop it! Stop!

Stop. What the fuck are you doing?
Did you hear me?

- What are you doing?
- It's none of your business.

- What did you say to me?
- What? None of it fits anyone,

and it's too shitty for Goodwill,
so what're you getting so mad for?

It might not feel like it now...

but there's gonna come a day
when you're staring at a picture...

of your dad wearing some...

fucking stupid motorcycle T-shirt...

and you're gonna wish to fucking God...

that someone said to you,
"You know what? Keep that jacket.

Keep that dress."

'Cause right then,
all you're gonna want to do is put it on.

'Cause that's the fucking
closest thing you got.

Hey! Where are the guns?

What are you talking about?

Two handguns. They're not in the trailer,
and they're not in the truck, either.

So, you're, um...

you're still promising to buy us suits
for the funeral?

Yeah.

Okay, then.

[engine starts]

- Dad said 2:00.
- [sighs] He's just late.

- He's never late. It's rude.
- No, it's a long drive, sweetheart.

[Bob] Wendy.

Marty sent me.

Maybe you want the kids
to wait in the car?

[Wendy] Is he okay?

Your husband's fine.

He instructed me to bring you these.

There's passports,
Social Security cards, birth certificates.

"Michael Fleming"?

"Cindy." Are these real people?
Are... Are we stealing their identities?

I don't want to be Mike Fleming.

I'm afraid choosing names isn't an option.

What if people call me Flem?

Wendy, your license will need
to be renewed in six months.

- And I'll also need your phones.
- No fucking way.

- Charlotte, please.
- My life's in there.

Use this until you establish
a permanent location...

- Please.
- Then you can set up accounts

in your new names.

Please.

[sniffs] Charlotte.

How do you know my husband?

He hired me a few months back.

What do you do, exactly?

I'm a private investigator.

In Chicago.

[Jonah] Why would Dad hire
a private investigator?

[Charlotte]
What about my dad's envelope?

Did... Did you send it to him already?

I was only hired to create
three identities.

- Mom...
- [Bob] I'll give you some privacy.

Sir...

did he ask you
to make these up recently or...

when you were doing
your investigating in Chicago?

It was after I finished my work for him.

The day before you left.

Ma'am.

Mom...

do something.
Just call him. Do something.

[dialing]

[crickets chirping ringtone]

[Buddy] Friends of yours?

Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's just a meeting.

Enjoy your walk. It's okay.

It's okay.

Go on.

Hey, hey! Del, it's amazing,
I was literally just about to call you.

Is that so?

Yeah, got the answer to all our problems.

And what kind of problems
do I have, Marty?

Bad choice of words.
It's just a figure of speech.

No, it's a good word.

Problem.

What else do you call it when your trusted
lieutenant refuses to answer your calls?

- Hmm?
- What are you talking about?

Where the fuck is Garcia?

[cell phone ringing]

[Ruth] Hello?

[automated voice] This is
the Missouri Department of Corrections.

- You have a collect call from...
- [Cade] Cade Langmore.

[automated voice]
To accept charges, say, "Accept."

To decline, say, "Decline," or hang up.

Accept.

[Wyatt] Come on.

Daddy?

Warden just called me in.

Told me my brothers were dead.

That true?

Yeah.

Said it was some kind of accident.

Um...

They got electrocuted on a dock.

At the Blue Cat Lodge.

And Marty Byrde?

How's his health?

He's fine.

You and me are gonna talk in person.

Listen, Daddy. I'm...

[automated voice]
Your call is no longer connected.

[Wyatt] Uncle Cade? How'd he take it?

[Ruth] Who knows anything with him?

I know what happened, you know.

I figured it out
when the guns went missing.

They weren't going to the Blue Cat
for a fucking beer.

They were going to kill Charlotte's dad.

At least rob him.

You don't know that.

What, business opportunity?
Skipping town? Not telling you?

They were gonna kill him...

except he got to them first.

Marty Byrde doesn't have it in him
to kill someone.

Not even in a chickenshit kind of way,
like a rigged dock.

My guess is,
is fuckin' Boyd did some stupid shit,

like hit the power cord
or some shit like that.

Yeah.

And the other part?

I don't know. Maybe.

Look... I don't want Three growing up

knowing that his dad was willing
to be a murderer, okay?

Listen, I've been thinking. Um...

I know I'm only two years
older than you, but...

And you're way fuckin' smarter than me...

- No, I'm...
- No, no, just fuckin' listen.

I was thinking that...

maybe I could call Social Services
and see if they'd let me be your guardian.

Not to, like, you know,
give you rules and shit, but...

more just so
nothing can ever split us apart.

I mean, would you be okay with that?

Yeah. Yeah, totally.

Um... what do you think?

[Ruth] You look perfect.

[Del sighs]

Where is he, Marty?

I told you, I don't know.

Hang on.

I do not know where he is.
I do not know where he is.

Del, goddamn it.
I've got no fucking idea.

Hey. I have no idea where the...

[screams] Goddamn it! Shit!

Fuck! Motherfucker!

Why would he call
and tell me there was a problem?

[groans]

[sighs] I don't know.

I've got no idea.

Del... hang on!

I've got no idea where Garcia is.

Hang on, goddamn it! [groans]

No! Fuck!

Fuck! [panting]

Why would I do anything to him?

I finished the summer.
I got a new shipment.

My life is good!

Where the fuck is Garcia?

I don't know.

Ah! Fuck you!

- [choking]
- Why are you taking this? Huh?

Huh? We both know
that you barely made the eight million.

What makes you think you can handle 50?

[straining] I've got a plan.

You didn't give me the details.

[Marty panting]

I'm getting my fucking toenails
ripped off. [coughing]

You didn't give me any of the details.

I knew Bruce was lying
because he finally shut his big mouth.

You, when you were lying,
you talked a mile a minute.

But now... you do have something.

Don't you?

I just need you to have an open mind.

[Nix] So you're looking for this fella
on behalf of the Mexican government?

They're requesting extradition.

This is a drunk and disorderly from 2002.

Yes.

So y'all must want this sucker pretty bad,
digging this deep in the trash.

- We do.
- Hey, boss.

Patrol car just got a hit on that plate.

It's a black Suburban, heading
onto the Heron Mills Foothills Estate.

All right.

Heron Mills.

There a problem?

That's the Snell farm.
It's over 500 acres.

You go in there cherries blazing,

your target's likely to disappear
into the wild.

You got another idea?

You got a warrant to go in. I don't.

But if this fella's got no reason
to be suspicious,

there's only one main road in and out.

So, you wait outside that,

I'll provide as much backup as you need,
and he'll roll straight into your arms.

Jacob, Darlene, uh...
this is, uh, Camino Del Rio.

He's a representative from
the second-largest drug cartel in Mexico.

Gentlemen.

So precise.

Always with "the second-largest."

Yeah. [chuckles] Um... should we sit down?

Uh...

Darlene and Jacob...

grow and control all of the heroin
in this area.

Congratulations.

- [dog barks]
- [Del] Hey.

Jumper, get. Get!

- [Ash] Hey, Jumper, get.
- [Darlene] He's a hunting dog.

He's sensitive to different smells.

So, I... I am in the unique position

of understanding the needs
of your operation and of your operation,

and I think that what I have here

is something that's...
that's mutually beneficial.

Uh, they have a distribution problem,
and... and I'm proposing

that the cartel becomes the sole buyer
and distributor of their product.

- And why would I consider this?
- [Marty] Because you...

lose roughly 20% of your product
to seizure at the border.

And this would offset that loss,

and would also put you about seven hours
from your central hub in Chicago.

And you make good money
controlling all the heroin in this area?

Yes, we do.

I'm sorry.
I just have no way to tell, you know?

[Marty] My point is...

buying the product in this region
would mitigate your risk,

and it would alleviate
their distribution problem.

I'm a man of charity. You know this of me.

But helping the less fortunate
is not my primary motivation.

Sure, um... if I may, uh...

This, uh... this map here...

Pardon me. Um, this here...

Right there. This is your property.

Okay? And the first time I came here,
you pointed out this stream right here,

and I saw that it flowed west.

It's curious, right? Flowing west?

So, if you trace that stream
all the way here, all the way there,

all the way up into Jefferson City...

it hits the Missouri.

That means it's not a tributary to,

but is an... it's an actual branch
of the Missouri River.

Missouri law states
that a riverboat casino can be built

within 1,000 feet of any approved river.

- The Missouri River makes that list.
- [Jacob] That stream ain't a river.

That's true.
But if you dam that stream right here...

and you flood these three acres,
you turn it into a river,

which makes it eligible to house a casino.

And that's away from all of the land
that you use for your growth operation.

- Flooding.
- That's right.

You're aware of our family history,
how we come to be on this hill.

- But this is three acres.
- Symbolism matters, Mr. Byrde.

Maybe not to people who have no pride,
no history. But to us.

Riverboat casinos gross
nearly $90 million a month.

But, besides being incredibly profitable,
a casino will be able to handle

all of the money laundering needs
of your operation...

and of yours.

All of it.

[Jacob] I'm afraid that...

you're too stupid to understand
what it is you're suggesting.

Since 1985...

you have spent your profits...

to buy roughly ten acres
of surrounding property every year.

And you never build, right?

If I had to guess,

I would say that your goal
is to get some kind of leverage

over that power company that displaced
your people, long ago, with that flooding.

A casino will give you a lot of money.
Buy a lot of land.

It would give you
a lot of political capital.

You'd be able to do, in five years,

what no Snell has been able to do
in the last 75.

Mr. Del Rio?

I need to make a phone call.

Someplace private.

Ash.

I don't want them touching anything.

[sighs]

I'll be right back.

[phone ringing]

- Byrde residence.
- [Wendy] Hi, it's Wendy.

[Buddy] Are you safe?

Yeah, we're okay. I, um...

I've been trying
to get in touch with Marty,

and he's not answering his phone.

And I... I just need to know
if he's still alive.

Buddy?

As far as I know.

There were a couple of more Mexicans here.
He didn't want my help.

He drove off with 'em.

That doesn't mean he's not okay.

No, of course not.

Thank you.

For...

For everything.

Well, it's just what you do.

[chuckles softly]

Bye, Buddy.

[line disconnects]

We have a deal.

Okay.

I'll leave it to Marty here
to work out the details.

Okay, great news. Good.

I told them that there
was some dark business here.

- Garcia must have gotten involved somehow.
- Hmm.

He was always too ambitious.

Okay.

Okay.

Only Marty Byrde can move to Missouri...

and somehow convince me to partner
with a bunch of rednecks.

- [chuckles]
- [Darlene] I'm sorry. What was that?

I said only Marty Byrde...

can somehow convince me...

to partner with a bunch of red...

[gunshot]

[gagging]

[Jacob] Goddamn it, Darlene.

You just cannot be doing that.

I won't abide that talk. You know that.

[gunshot]

Man was a guest.

Ash, get some towels, please.

- He was disrespectful.
- Mm-hmm.

[Marty] You fucked us.

Oh, you've completely fucked us.
You know that?

Are you out of your goddamn minds?

Huh? Are you fucking crazy?
Do you know who that guy works for?

[Jacob] I suggest you watch your mouth,

or you and her are gonna have
some discrepancies.

His boss, your new partner,
is gonna be expecting him home.

And when he doesn't,

they'll send another Mexican
to take his place.

If there's one thing Mexico is full of,
it is Mexicans.

And what the fuck are we gonna say
to that guy about Del?

Why would we kill someone
we'd just gone into partnership with?

No logic to it... is there, Darlene?

I might have overreacted.

This cost me my family, you know that?

This deal was done.
They could have come home.

Now, there's gonna be men coming here,

they're gonna be looking for answers
I can't give.

They made a deal with us,
and they're gonna honor it.

And if they don't,
then you're in partnership with us now.

And we know how to look after our own.

Right now, you go home, relax,
maybe get yourself a frozen custard.

Me and Darlene will clean up this mess.

[sighs]

[siren wails]

[Nix on speaker] Turn the vehicle off,
drop the keys on the ground.

Open the door.

[keys clatter]

Open the door. Exit the car slowly.

Hands up. Hands up!

[translating in Spanish]

On the ground.

[Evans] Shut 'em off.

Don't you move.

Where the hell is he?

- Who?
- Camino Del Rio. Where the fuck is he?

[Marty] I don't know who that is.

[Evans sighs]

Get the fuck up. Get up.

I've been in this car all day.
No one else has been in it.

- [door opens]
- Clear these out of here.

What? Where are you going?

I'm pulling this out of the way,
then I'm going up there.

Yeah, no. No, I can't let you do that.

You what?

The warrant was to locate the car.
We found it.

You're shitting me, right?

I don't have probable cause to go
onto private property.

I've got a witness
who saw Del Rio in this car.

Can you produce him?

Does that mean I can go now?

You got my keys.

[inaudible]

[soft classical music playing]

[baby crying]

[Mason shushing]

[crying continues]

[knocking]

- [door opens]
- [Marty] Hi.

I was just driving by and I saw your car.

I thought I'd stop in and...
and check on you guys.

Heard about Grace. I'm sorry.

You know, if you fold this
in a triangle...

Can I show you? You can...

You just put his head here.
Let me show you.

- I got him.
- Yeah? Okay. Sorry.

If you just put his head there
in the middle, you can... kinda...

wrap this one side around him.

- [Mason sighs]
- [baby coos]

Yep, and then bring up the bottom.

Then you wrap the other side around and
tuck it in like an envelope, and...

make, like, a little burrito.

- [Mason exhales]
- [baby cooing]

Oh, yeah. Come here, bubba.

- [baby crying]
- [shushing] Come here. Come here.

Charlotte fought it at first,
but it keeps them feeling safe.

The police are saying
that there's no evidence of a crime.

They're acting like I'm the insane one.

- What's his name?
- He doesn't have a name.

Well, don't wait too long.
He's gotta hear it.

Why would I want to keep
a baby alive in this world?

Because kids are hope. Hmm?

You know, that...
that maybe things can get better.

You know, I had this, uh...

faith that getting shot and surviving
meant that there was a God.

It was Grace who told me
how naive I was and that...

all it meant was that shit happens.

Sometimes we get lucky.

- [softly] Yeah.
- You don't believe that, do you?

Uh...

No, you're right.

There's gotta be a God.

'Cause there's a devil.

I think you're the fucking devil.

[soft classical music continues]

[dialing]

[sighs]

- [Wendy] Okay?
- [cell phone ringing]

- I'm serious.
- [Jonah] Yeah.

Hi. Please tell me you're okay.

[Marty] Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm sorry that I haven't called.

No, it's... [sighs]
It doesn't matter. It's okay.

Look, we'll come straight home.

Uh, Wendy, you can't.

You were right. Um, it's...
it's never gonna be safe here.

Okay?

Then you come to us.

I don't think I can.

I think if I do that...
they'll never stop looking.

You know?

Um, I saw Mason's baby today.

He's healthy. He's perfect.

There has to be a solution here.

Yeah, there is. You're doing it.

You want to talk to the kids?

No.

I think if...
if I hear their voices it's, um...

You know.

Maybe I'll try you tomorrow.

I am so sorry I hurt you, Marty.

I should never have done that.

It's not your fault.
I was just shut down, you know?

I don't wanna hang up.

[disconnects call]

[trembling sigh]

[Charlotte] Was that Dad?

Was it?
Nobody else would have that number.

[Jonah] Is he okay?

Are we going home?

[engine starts]

[engine stops]

- We're trying to keep you safe.
- So that's a no. We're not going home.

Your father and I
made this decision together.

[Charlotte] So let me talk to him.

Charlotte, give me the keys.

Is it unsafe there right now?
Right this second?

Honestly, I do not know.

Look, I know you're just trying
to take us somewhere safe,

but that place doesn't exist.

I mean, we should at least stay together.

[sighs] We won't even know where to turn
once we get out of this parking lot.

I mean, we'll just be driving.
We've been driving for days.

How are you silent back there?
Just say something!

[Charlotte sighs]

I don't want to be Mike Fleming.

It's just a name, sweetheart.

[Charlotte]
I'm old enough to decide for myself.

That's not what I meant.

[Charlotte]
I'm not some little girl, you know?

I've done things
that you have no idea about.

You made us adults the second
you told us about what Dad was doing.

You can't take it all back now.

I meant, I don't want Jonah to die.

What do you mean?

Well, the second I become Mike Fleming...

that means Jonah Byrde is dead.

I don't want him to be dead.

[soft classical music continues]

[no audible sounds]

[baby crying]

[Mason grunts softly]

[baby crying]

Hey.

[panting]

[baby cries]

[soft classical music continues]

You ready?

Yep.

- [Ruth] I love you.
- [Wyatt] I love you, too.

[vehicle approaching]

- [vehicle doors opening]
- Hello?

[vehicle doors closing]

- [Charlotte] Dad?
- Dad!
