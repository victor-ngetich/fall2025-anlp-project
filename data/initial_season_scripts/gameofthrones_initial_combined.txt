(LAUGHTER, CHATTER)

(CHATTER STOPS)

You're wondering why
I brought you all here.

After all, we just had a feast.

Since when does old Walder

give us two feasts
in a single fortnight?

- (MEN LAUGH)
- (WALDER CHUCKLES)

Well, it's no good being
Lord of the Riverlands

if you can't celebrate
with your family.

That's what I say!

- (ALL CHEERING)
- Yes!

(SNAPS FINGERS)

I've gathered every Frey
who means a damn thing

so I can tell you my plans
for this great house

now that winter has come.

But first, a toast!

No more of that
Dornish horse piss!

This is the finest Arbor gold!

Proper wine for proper heroes!

(ALL CHEERING)

Stand together!

ALL: Stand together!

Not you.

I'm not wasting good wine
on a damn woman.

Maybe I'm not
the most pleasant man.

I'll admit it.
But I'm proud of you lot.

You're my family,
the men who helped me

slaughter the Starks
at the Red Wedding.

- (CHEERING)
- WALDER: Yes, yes.

Cheer.

Brave men, all of you.

Butchered a woman
pregnant with her babe.

Cut the throat
of a mother of five.

Slaughtered your guests
after inviting them

into your home.

But you didn't slaughter
every one of the Starks.

- (MEN GROANING)
- No, no, that was your mistake.

You should have ripped them
all out, root and stem.

(ALL COUGHING,
CHOKING)

Leave one wolf alive

and the sheep are never safe.

(ALL GASPING,

When people ask you
what happened here...

tell them the North remembers.

Tell them winter came
for House Frey.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

(WIND HOWLING)

(GATE OPENS)

You wildlings?

I'm Meera Reed,
daughter of Howland Reed.

This is Brandon Stark,

son of Ned Stark.

How do I know that's true?

You were at
the Fist of the First Men.

You were at Hardhome.

You've seen
the Army of the Dead.

You've seen the Night King.

He's coming for us.

For all of us.

Okay, come on.

Let's get them inside.

(GATE RUMBLING)

JON: I want every northern
maester to scour their records

for any mention of dragonglass.

Dragonglass kills white walkers.

It's more valuable
to us now than gold.

We need to find it,
we need to mine it,

we need to make weapons from it.

Everyone aged 10 to 60

will drill daily with spears,
pikes, bow and arrow.

It's about time we taught these
boys of summer how to fight.

- (LAUGHTER)
- Not just the boys.

We can't defend the North

if only half the population is fighting.

You expect me to put a spear
in my granddaughter's hand?

I don't plan on knitting by the
fire while men fight for me.

I might be small, Lord Glover,
and I might be a girl,

but I am every bit as much
a Northerner as you.

Indeed you are, my lady.
No one has questioned...

And I don't need your
permission to defend the North.

We'll begin training every man,
woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

MEN: Aye!
(POUNDING TABLES)

While we're
preparing for attack,

we need to shore up
our defenses.

The only thing standing between us and
the Army of the Dead is the Wall,

and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

I'm not the king
of the Free Folk.

But if we're going to survive
this winter together...

(GRUNTS)

You want us to man
the castles for you?

- (MEN MURMURING)
- JON: Aye.

Last time we saw the Night
King was at Hardhome.

The closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

Then that's where I'll go.

Looks like we're
the Night's Watch now.

(CHATTER)

If they breach the Wall,

the first two castles
in their path

are Last Hearth and Karhold.

The Umbers and the Karstarks
betrayed the North.

Their castles
should be torn down

with not a stone left standing.

The castles committed no crimes.

And we need every fortress
we have for the war to come.

We should give the Last Hearth
and Karhold to new families,

loyal families who supported
us against Ramsay.

MEN: Aye!

The Umbers and the Karstarks

have fought beside
the Starks for centuries.

They've kept faith for
generation after generation.

And then they broke faith.

I'm not going to strip these
families of their ancestral homes

because of the crimes
of a few reckless sons.

SANSA: So there's no
punishment for treason

and no reward for loyalty?

The punishment
for treason is death.

Smalljon Umber died
on the field of battle.

Harald Karstark died
on the field of battle.

They died fighting for Ramsay.

Give the castles to the families

of the men who died
fighting for you.

(MEN CHATTERING,
POUNDING TABLES)

When I was Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch...

I executed men who betrayed me.

I executed men who
refused to follow orders.

My father always said,

"The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword,"

and I have tried
to live by those words.

But I will not punish a son
for his father's sins,

and I will not take
a family home away

from a family it has
belonged to for centuries.

That is my decision,

and my decision is final.

Ned Umber.

Alys Karstark.

For centuries,
our families fought

side by side on the battlefield.

I ask you to pledge your loyalty
once again to House Stark,

to serve as our bannermen

and come to our aid
whenever called upon.

Stand.

Yesterday's wars
don't matter anymore.

The North needs
to band together,

all the living north.

Will you stand beside me,
Ned and Alys,

now and always?

BOTH: Now and always!

(MEN CHEERING,
POUNDING TABLES)

JON: You are my sister,
but I am king now.

Will you start wearing a crown?

When you question my decisions

in front of the other lords
and ladies, you undermine me.

So I can't question
your decisions anymore?

Of course you can, but...

Joffrey never let anyone
question his authority.

You think he was a good king?

Do you think I'm Joffrey?

You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

Thank you.

You're good at this, you know.

- At what?
- At ruling.

(SIGHS)
No.

You are.

You are.

They respect you,
they really do,

- but you have to...
- (CHUCKLES)

Why are you laughing?

What did father used to say?

Everything before the
word "but" is horse shit.

He never said that to me.

No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

SANSA: Because he was
trying to protect us.

He never wanted us to see
how dirty the world really is,

but Father couldn't protect
me and neither can you.

Stop trying.

All right, I'll stop
trying to protect you

and you stop trying
to undermine me.

I'm not trying to undermine you!

You have to be
smarter than Father.

You need to be
smarter than Robb.

I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

and they both
lost their heads for it.

And how should I be smarter?

By listening to you?

Would that be so terrible?

A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.

"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

Protector of
the Seven Kingdoms..."

What does she want?

(SIGHS)
Come to King's Landing.

Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

I'm consumed with the Night
King because I've seen him.

And believe me, you'd think
of little else if you had, too.

We still have a wall between
us and the Night King.

There's nothing
between us and Cersei.

There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

Winter is here. The Lannisters
are a southern army.

They've never ranged
this far north.

You're the military man,
but I know her.

If you're her enemy, she'll never
stop until she's destroyed you.

Everyone who's ever crossed her,
she's found a way to murder.

You almost sound
as if you admire her.

I learned a great deal from her.

What is this?

It's what we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

It's what Father trained us for,
whether he knew it or not.

He knew it.

Made me memorize
every damn city, town,

lake, forest, and mountain.

It's ours now.
We just have to take it.

You've been quiet
since you came home.

Are you angry with me?

No, not angry.

Are you afraid of me?

Should I be?

Daenerys Targaryen has chosen
Tyrion to be her Hand.

Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

hoping to take back
her father's throne.

Our little brother,

the one you love so much,

the one you set free,

the one who murdered our
father and our first-born son,

now he stands beside our enemies
and gives them counsel.

He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

Where will they land?

Dragonstone.

They have deep-water
ports for the ships.

Stannis left
the castle unoccupied,

and that's where she was born.

Enemies to the east.

Enemies to the south...

Ellaria Sand
and her brood of bitches.

Enemies to the west...

Olenna, the old cunt.

Another traitor.

Enemies to the north.

Ned Stark's bastard has been
named King in the North

and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

Enemies everywhere.
We're surrounded by traitors.

You're in command
of the Lannister army now.

- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

We can't win a war if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

The Tyrells have the grain,
the Tyrells have the livestock.

Will the Tyrell bannermen
stand alongside

a Dothraki horde
and Unsullied slave soldiers?

If they think Daenerys will win.

No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

Right now, we look like the losing side.

I'm the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

Three kingdoms, at best.

I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

I understand we're
in a war for survival.

I understand whoever loses dies.

I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

that lasts a thousand years.

A dynasty for whom?

Our children are dead.

We're the last of us.

A dynasty for us, then.

We never talked about Tommen.

There's nothing to say.

Our baby boy killed himself.

He betrayed me.

He betrayed us both.

Should we spend our days
mourning the dead...

Mother, father,
and all our children?

- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

But they're ashes now and
we're still flesh and blood.

We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

Where are our allies now?

You saw what happened to
Walder Frey and his family.

I heard.

- How could we ever trust a man like that?
- We couldn't.

He was a useless, old coward,

but the Freys supported us.

Now they're all dead.

Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

We need allies.

Stronger, better allies.

We can't win this war alone.

You think I listened to Father for
40 years and learned nothing?

(SEAGULLS SCREECHING)

JAIME: The Greyjoys?

You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like all of them.

I invited Euron Greyjoy,

the new King
of the Iron Islands.

You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

How are they different
from the Freys?

They both broke their promises

and murdered their former friends
as soon as it suited them.

So does everyone
when it suits them.

Unlike the Freys,
they have ships.

- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

I know the ironborn. They're
bitter, angry little people.

All they know how to do is steal things
they can't build or grow themselves.

Euron Greyjoy didn't
come here for that.

Oh, what did
he come here for, then?

A queen.

EURON: The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

they turned on me.
(CHUCKLES)

Their own uncle.

They stole
my best ships and ran.

Sailed them
right across the world

and gave them
to the Dragon Queen

so she could bring her
armies here to attack you.

It's nothing compared
to the treason you suffered

at the hands of a family
member, from what I hear.

But still, it bothers me.

Murdering them would
make me feel a lot better.

And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

are fighting for the same side,

I thought we rightful monarchs

could murder them together.

You're not a rightful
monarch, though, are you?

The Greyjoys rebelled against the
throne for the right to be monarchs,

but as I recall,
you were soundly defeated.

Come to mention it,

weren't you the one
who started that rebellion

by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

You certainly caught us there.

Very smart move on your part.

Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

I was there.

I remember very well.

I saw you.

I heard so much talk.

The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

I didn't believe it,
to be honest.

But I must say when you
rushed through the breach

and started
cutting people down...

it was glorious.

Like a dance.

The people I was cutting
down were your own kin.

The place was getting crowded.

I enjoyed watching it.
I truly did.

And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

A good thing for me.

If you hadn't crushed us, I
wouldn't have gone into exile.

If I hadn't done that,

I wouldn't be the greatest
captain on the 14 seas.

If not the most humble.

You're not humble.

You're the queen
of a great nation.

You don't care about
the Iron Islands.

They're nothing but rocks
and bird shit and...

And a lot of very
unattractive people.

The Iron Fleet,
on the other hand,

that's something else entirely.

It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

With the Iron Fleet,
you own the seas.

You can defeat
the invaders of the east

and the pretenders
of the north and south.

What do you want in return?

Ever since I was a little boy,

I wanted to grow up and marry

the most beautiful woman
in the world.

So here I am,

with a thousand ships

and two good hands.

I decline your proposal.

Why?

You're not trustworthy.

You've broken promises
to allies before

and murdered them
at the nearest opportunity.

You murdered your own brother.

You should try it.
Feels wonderful.

(LAUGHS)

I don't expect you
to trust me outright.

You need proof
of my honest intentions.

In my experience,

the surest way to a woman's
heart is with a gift.

A priceless gift.

I won't return to King's Landing

until I have that for you.

The triumph

Mankind's curse.

Archmaester, I was wondering...

What's the weight?

Um, 147.

I was wondering if you had
considered my proposition.

I don't remember
your proposition.

I asked you if, in light of
what I've seen in the North,

if I could have access to the
restricted area of the library.

That area is reserved
for maesters.

- Are you a maester?
- No.

Not a very strong
proposition, is it?

Archmaester, with respect,

I've seen them...

The Army of the Dead.

The white walkers.

I was sent here to learn
how to defeat them,

but everyone in the Citadel,

those who will even talk to me,

they all doubt the walkers ever
existed in the first place.

Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

It's their job.

But the tales of the Long Night
can't be pure fabrication.

Too many similarities
from unconnected sources.

Sources in the restricted area?

The very same.

And the simplest explanation

for your grating obsession
with the white walkers

is that you're telling the truth

and that you saw
what you say you saw.

So, you believe me.

I do.

You'll finish
weighing that heart?

That makes you the only person
south of the Twins who does.

We're not like the people
south of the Twins.

And we're not like the
people north of the Twins.

In the Citadel, we lead different
lives for different reasons.

We are this world's memory,
Samwell Tarly.

Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

Don't remember
any meal but the last,

can't see forward
to any but the next.

And every time you leave the
house and shut the door,

they howl like
you're gone forever.

When Robert's Rebellion
was raging,

people thought the end was near.

The end of the Targaryen dynasty.
"How will we survive?"

When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward

and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush...

"The end is near!
How will we survive?"

And thousands of years before
that, during the Long Night,

we can forgive them for
thinking it truly was the end.

But it wasn't.
None of it was.

The Wall has stood
through it all.

And every winter
that ever came has ended.

Be a good lad.
Clean this up.

I don't hate you.

Don't like you,

Thank you, Clegane.

That warms the heart.

But there's nothing

You're right about that.

So why does the Lord of Light
keep bringing you back?

I've met better men than you,

and they've been hanged from
crossbeams, or beheaded,

or just shat themselves to
death in a field somewhere.

None of them came back.

So, why you?

You think I don't
ask myself that?

Every hour of every day?

Why am I here?

What am I supposed to do?

What does the Lord see in me?

And?

I don't know.

I don't understand our Lord.

I don't know

I only know that
He wants me alive.

If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he
just tell you what the fuck he wants?

There's no divine justice,

What do you see?

Ice.

A wall of ice.

It's where the Wall
meets the sea.

There's a castle there.

There's a mountain.

(SEAGULLS SCREECHING)

(DRAGONS SCREECHING)

(SCREECHING)

Shall we begin?

(Bells chiming, birds singing)

(Horse whinnies)

(Men shouting)

(Ned) Does Ser Hugh have
any famiIy in the capitaI?

No.

I stood vigil
for him myself last night.

He had no one else.

He'd never worn this armor before.

Bad luck for him -
going against the Mountain.

Who determines the draw?

All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

Aye.

But who holds the straws?

You've done good work, Sisters.

Life is strange.

Not so many years ago
we fought as enemies at the Trident.

l'm gIad we never met
on the field, Ser Barristan.

As is my wife. l don't think
the widow's life would suit her.

(Chuckles) You're too modest.

I've seen you cut down
a dozen great knights.

My father once told me
you were the best he'd ever seen.

I never knew the man to be wrong
about matters of combat.

He was a fine man, your father.

What the Mad King
did to him was a terrible crime.

And that lad -

he was a squire
until a few months ago.

How could he afford a new suit of armor?

Perhaps Lord Arryn
left him some money?

- I hear the king wants to joust today.
- Yes, that wiII never happen.

(Chuckles) Robert tends
to do what he wants.

If the king got what
he wanted all the time,

he'd still be fighting
a damned rebellion.

It's made too small, Your Grace.
lt won't go.

Your mother was
a dumb whore with a fat arse.

Did you know that?

Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.

He can't even put
a man's armor on him properly.

- You're too fat for your armor.
- Fat?

Fat, is it?

Is that how you speak to your king?

(Laughing)

Oh, it's funny, is it?

- No, Your Grace.
- No?

You don't like the Hand's joke?

You're torturing the poor boy.

You heard the Hand.
The king's too fat for his armor.

Go find the breastplate
stretcher - now!

- (Laughs)
- "The breastplate stretcher"?

How long before he figures it out?

- Maybe you should have one invented.
- AII right, aII right.

You watch me out there.
I still know how to point a lance.

You've no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.

Why, because I'm king?
Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.

- And the last man in his saddle. . .
- WiII be you.

There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms
wouId risk hurting you.

Are you telling me
those cowards would let me win?

Aye.

- Drink.
- I'm not thirsty.

Drink. Your king commands it.

Gods,

too fat for my armor.

Your squire -
a Lannister boy?

Mm. A bloody idiot,

but Cersei insisted.

I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

"Cersei Lannister will make
a good match," he toId me.

"You'll need her father on your side."

I thought being king
meant I could do whatever I wanted.

Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em ride.

At least I can smell
someone else's blood.

- Robert.
- What?

Oh. (Laughs)

An inspiring sight for the people, eh?

Come, bow before your king!
Bow, you shits!

(Ned chuckles)

(Cheering)

- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.

The Knight of the Flowers.

Thank you, Ser Loras.

(Horse neighs)

(Crowd jeering)

(Horse grunting and neighing)

Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.

- Hey.
- I can't watch.

A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.

- l'II take that bet.
- Now what will I buy with 1 00 gold dragons?

A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?

Or a girl from
the pleasure houses of Lys?

- Or you could even buy a friend.
- He's going to die.

Ser Loras rides well.

(Neighing)

(Fanfare)

- (Gasps)
- (Laughs)

Such a shame, Littlefinger.

It would have been so nice
for you to have a friend.

And tell me, Lord Renly,

when will you be having your friend?

(Neighs)

Loras knew his mare was in heat.
Quite crafty, reaIIy.

Ser Loras would never do that.

- There's no honor in tricks.
- No honor and quite a bit of gold.

- (Helmet clanks)
- Sword!

(Horse neighs)

- (Gasps)
- (Neighs)

- (Crowd gasps)
- (Grunts)

Leave him be!

(Growls)

Stop this madness
in the name of your king!

(Robert) Let him go!

I owe you my life, ser.

I'm no ser.

(Cheering)

(Grunting)

Remove his hood.

♪ On that eve, the captive Imp

♪ Downwards from his horse did limp

♪ No more would he preen and primp

♪ In garb of red and gold ♪

(Tyrion) This isn't the Kingsroad.

- You said we were riding for Winterfell.
- l did... Often and IoudIy.

Very wise.
They'll be out in droves,

looking for me in the wrong place.

Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.

He'll be offering a handsome reward.

Everyone knows
a Lannister always pays his debts.

Would you be so good as to untie me?

- And why would I do that?
- Why not?

Am l going to run?
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.

Unless a shadowcat ate me first.

Shadowcats and hiII tribes
are the least of your concerns.

Ah, the eastern road.

We're going to the Vale.

You're taking me to your sister's
to answer for my imagined crimes.

Tell me, Lady Stark,
when was the last time you saw your sister?

- Five years ago.
- She's changed.

She was always a bit touched, but now. . .
You might as weII kiII me here.

- I am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am l.

I had nothing to do
with the attempt on your son's life.

- The dagger found. . .
- What sort of imbecile

arms an assassin with his own blade?

- Should I gag him?
- Why?

Am I starting to make sense?

- (Thuds, grunts)
- (Catelyn) Rodrik!

(Roaring)

My lady, this way.

Untie me.

If I die, what's the point?

(Neighs)

Ah!

(Man roars)

(Breathing heavily)

- Rodrik?
- I'll be fine, my lady.

There's no need to bloody yourself.

Your first?

You need a woman.

Nothing like a woman after a fight.

I'm willing if she is.

(Laughing)

Bran.

(Bran) The Iron Islands.
Sigil - a kraken.

Words - "We do not sow."

- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

Famed for their skills at archery,
navigation and Iovemaking.

(Laughs)

And failed rebellions.

SigiI - a stag,
a crowned stag now that Robert's king.

- Good.
- Words - "Ours is the fury."

- Lords - the Baratheons.
- Mm-hm.

The Westerlands.

- Sigil - a lion.
- Mmm.

- Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts."
- No.

A common saying,
but not their official motto.

- (Arrow thunks)
- Lords - the Lannisters.

- We're still on their words.
- l don't know them.

You do know them. Think.

"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken."

- That's House Martell.
- "Righteous in wrath."

- House Hornwood.
- "Family, duty, honor."

Those are Tully words -
your mother's.

- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honor. . .

- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

Family comes first?

Your mother had to leave Winterfell
to protect the famiIy.

How can she protect the family

if she's not with her family?

Your mother sat by your bed

for three weeks while you slept.

And then she left!

When you were born, I was the one
who puIIed you from your mother.

I placed you in her arms.

From that moment
until the moment she dies,

she will love you.

Absolutely.

- FierceIy.
- Why did she leave?

(Sighs) I still can't tell you,

- but she wiII be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now?

- (Arrow thunks)
- Today?

- No, I don't.
- Then how can you promise me

she'll be home soon?

Sometimes I worry
you're too smart for your own good.

I'll never shoot another arrow.

And where is that written?

- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.

If the saddle Lord Tyrion
designed actually works,

you could learn
to shoot a bow from horseback.

Really?

Dothraki boys Iearn
when they're four years old.

Why shouldn't you?

(Grunting)

(Moans)

Shh, keep it down.

You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.

I thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

Important enough for the likes of you.

You're not the only nobleman
in my Iife, you know.

Who, the Imp?
I'd call him half a nobleman.

Jealous?

Why should I be jealous?

Anyone with a few coppers
in his pocket can own you for the night.

What's a dwarf like down below?

I've always wondered.

- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?

He's good with his fingers too.
And his tongue.

Generous tipper.

I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.

You are jealous.

I'm a Greyjoy.

We've been Iords
of the Iron Islands for 300 years.

There's not a family in Westeros
that can Iook down on us,

not even the Lannisters.

And what about the Starks?

I've been Lord Stark's ward
since l was eight years oId.

A ward -
that's a nice word for it.

Your father rebelled
against King Robert and if he does it again. . .

My father fought
for the freedom of his people.

What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

You're a very serious boy.

- l'm not a boy.
- Oh, yes, you are.

A serious boy
with a serious cock.

I don't want to pay for it.

Then get yourself a wife.

- (Arya) Come on.
- (Meows)

- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- (Meows)

(Meows)

How is your son, my lord?

He'll never walk again.

But his mind is sound?

So they say.

A blessing, then.

I suffered an early mutilation myself.

Some doors close forever. . .

others open
in most unexpected places.

May I?

lf the wrong ears heard
what I'm about to tell you,

off comes my head.

And who would mourn poor Varys then?

North or South,
they sing no songs for spiders.

But there are things you must know.

You are the King's Hand
and the king is a fool -

your friend, l know, but a fooI -
and doomed unless you save him.

I've been in the capital a month.

Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?

I didn't trust you.

So why do you trust me now?

The queen is not the onIy one
who has been watching you closely.

There are few men of honor
in the capitaI.

You are one of them.

I would like to believe I am another,
strange as that may seem.

What sort of doom does the king face?

The same sort as Jon Arryn.

The tears of lys, they call it.

A rare and costly thing,

as clear and tasteless as water.
lt Ieaves no trace.

Who gave it to him?

Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?

There were many.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

(Sighs) There was one boy.

All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

The squire, Ser Hugh?

Pity, what happened to him,

just when his Iife seemed to be
going so niceIy.

If Ser Hugh poisoned him. . .

who paid Ser Hugh?

- Someone who could afford it.
- Jon was a man of peace.

He was Hand for 1 7 years -
1 7 good years.

Why kill him?

He started asking questions.

(Meows)

(Man) He's found
one bastard already.

He has the book.

- The rest will come.
- (Lock clicks)

(Man #2) And when he knows the truth,
what wiII he do?

(Man #1 ) The gods alone know.

The fools tried to kill his son.

What's worse -
they botched it.

The wolf and the lion
will be at each other's throats.

- We will be at war soon, my friend.
- (Man #2) What good is war now?

We're not ready.

If one Hand can die,
why not a second?

(Man #1 ) This Hand is not the other.

(Man #2) We need time.

Khal Drogo will not make his move
until his son is born.

- You know what these savages are.
- "Delay," you say.

"Move fast," I reply.

This is no Ionger
a game for two players.

(Man #2) It never was.

The first to arrive
and the last to leave.

I admire your industry.

You do move quietly.

We all have our qualities.

You look a bit lonely today.

You shouId pay a visit
to my brothel this evening.

- First boy is on the house.
- l think you're mistaking

- business with pleasure.
- Am I?

All those birds that whisper in your ear -
such pretty IittIe things.

Trust me,

we accommodate all inclinations.

Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne
likes his boys very young, I hear.

I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion -
both equally important.

Though I suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
prefers amputees?

All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

And I heard the most awful rumor
about a certain Iord

with a taste for fresh cadavers.

Must be enormously difficult
to accommodate that inclination.

The logistics alone. . .

to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.

Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be
in accordance with the king's laws.

Strictly speaking.

Tell me. Does someone somewhere
keep your baIIs in a IittIe box?

I've often wondered.

Do you know,
I have no idea where they are.

- And we had been so close.
- (ChuckIes)

But enough about me.
How have you been

since we last saw each other?

Since you Iast saw me
or since I last saw you?

Now the last time I saw you,
you were talking to the Hand of the King.

- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes l own.

Council business.

We aII have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.

Everyone's weII aware of
your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.

If the Lannisters were behind the attempt
on the Stark boy's life

and it was discovered that you helped
the Starks come to that conclusion. . .

to think a simple word to the queen. . .

- One shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.

But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen you

even more recentIy
than you have seen me.

- Have you?
- Yes.

Earlier today, I distinctly recall

seeing you taIking
to Lord Stark in his chambers.

Was that you under the bed?

And not long after that

when I saw you escorting a certain

foreign dignitary. . .

Council business?

Of course, you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.

You're from there yourself, after all.

We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

I'd like to think we are.

So you can imagine my burden,

wondering if the king
might question my friend's sympathies.

To stand at a crossroads
where turning left means loyalty to a friend,

turning right loyalty to the realm. . .

- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position

- where a simple word to the king. . .
- (Door opens)

What are you two conspiring about?

Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

- My brother is coming.
- To a small council meeting?

Disturbing news from far away.

Hadn't you heard?

(Birds cawing, waves breaking)

Off with you. No begging.

I'm not a beggar.
l Iive here.

D'you want a smack on your ear
to heIp you with your hearing?

I want to see my father.

l want to fuck the queen,
for all the good it does me.

You want your father, boy?

He's lying on the floor of some tavern,
getting pissed on by his friends.

My father is Hand of the King!

I'm not a boy.
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell.

And if you lay a hand on me, my father
will have both your heads on spikes.

Now are you going to let me by
or do l need to smack you

on the ear to help with your hearing?

You know I had half my guard
out searching for you?

- You promised me this wouId stop.
- They said they were going to kill you.

- Who did?
- I didn't see them,

- but I think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya. (Sighs)

l'm not Iying!
They said you found the bastard

and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage. . .

Something about the savage.

- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

- near the dragon skulls.
- What were you doing in the dungeons?

Chasing a cat.

(Knock, door opens)

Pardon, my lord.

There's a night's watchman here
begging a word. Says it's urgent.

- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it pIease.

- This must be your son. He has the look.
- I'm a girl!

Did Benjen send you?

No one sent me, my Iord.
I'm here to find men for the Wall,

see if there's any scum in the dungeons
that might be fit for service.

- Oh, we'll find recruits for you.
- Thank you, my lord.

But that's not why I disturb you now.

Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black -

makes him as much
my brother as yours.

It's for his sake I rode here so hard
I damn near killed my horse.

There are others riding too.

The whole city will know by tomorrow.

Know what?

Best said in private, my lord.

Go on. We'll talk more later.

Jory, take her safely to her room.

Come along, my lady.
You heard your father.

- How many guards does my father have?
- Here in King's Landing? Fifty.

You wouldn't let anyone
kiII him, wouId you?

No fear on that count, little lady.

- WeII?
- It's about your wife, my lord.

She's taken the Imp.

(Neighs)

You're far from home, Lady Stark.

- To whom do I speak?
- Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

- Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
- There was no time to send word.

May I ask, my lady,

why he is with you?

That's why there was no time.

- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.

My sister will decide what he looks like.

Yes, my lady.
She will at that.

The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.

Give me ten good men
and some climbing spikes,

I'll impregnate the bitch.

(Tyrion) I like you.

Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested

in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been caIIed.

I need to see the king first - alone.

The king is at
the small council meeting, my lord.

He has summoned you.

- Is it about my wife?
- No, my Iord.

I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

- The whore is pregnant.
- You're speaking of murdering a child.

I warned you this would happen,
back in the North.

I warned you, but you didn't care to hear.

Well, hear it now.

l want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

And that fool Viserys as well.

Is that plain enough for you?
l want them both dead.

You will dishonor yourself
forever if you do this.

Honor?!
I've got seven kingdoms to rule!

One king, seven kingdoms.

Do you think honor keeps them in line?

Do you think it's honor
that's keeping the peace?

- It's fear - fear and blood.
- Then we're no better than the Mad King.

- Careful, Ned. Careful now.
- You want to assassinate a girl

because the spider heard a rumor?

No rumor, my Iord.
The princess is with child.

- Based on whose information?
- Ser Jorah Mormont.

He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

Mormont?
You bring us the whispers

of a traitor half a world away
and call it fact?

Jorah Mormont's a slaver,
not a traitor.

Small difference, I know,
to an honorable man.

He broke the law,
betrayed his family, fled our land.

We commit murder
on the word of this man?

(Robert) And if he's right?
lf she has a son?

A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army -

- what then?
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach
their horses to run on water.

Do nothing?

That's your wise advice?

Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

You're my council.
CounseI!

Speak sense to this honorable fool.

I understand your misgivings, my lord.

Truly, I do.
It is a terrible thing

we must consider, a vile thing.

Yet we who presume to rule

must sometimes do vile things

for the good of the realm.

Should the gods
grant Daenerys a son,

- the realm will bleed.
- I bear this girl no ill will,

but should the Dothraki invade,
how many innocents wiII die?

How many towns will burn?

Is it not wiser, kinder even,

that she should die now
so that tens of thousands might live?

We should have had them
both killed years ago.

When you find yourseIf
in bed with an ugly woman,

best close your eyes,
get it over with.

Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

I followed you into war -

twice,

without doubts,

without second thoughts.

But I will not follow you now.

The Robert I grew up with

didn't tremble at the shadow
of an unborn chiId.

She dies.

I will have no part in it.

You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

You'll do as I command
or I'll find me a Hand who will.

And good luck to him.

- I thought you were a better man.
- Out. Out, damn you.

I'm done with you.

Go, run back to Winterfell!

I'll have your head on a spike!

(Robert) I'll put it there myself, you fool!

You think you're too good for this?

Too proud and honorable?
This is a war!

I'll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready. Do it yourseIf.

- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, my lord.

Lord Baelish is here for you.

His Grace went on about you
at some length

after you took your leave.
The word "treason" was mentioned.

- What can l do for you?
- When do you return to Winterfell?

- Why? What do you care?
- If you're still here come nightfall,

l'II take you to see the Iast person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

If that sort of thing still interests you.

I don't have the time.

It won't take more than an hour.
But as you pIease.

Round up aII the men we have
and station them outside the girls' chambers.

- Who are your best two swords?
- Heward and WyI.

Find them and meet me at the stables.

You bring him here without permission?

You pollute my home with his presence?

(Sucking sounds)

Your aunt has done a bad thing,
Robin, a very bad thing.

You remember her, don't you?

Isn't he beautiful?

And strong too. Jon knew it.

His last words were
"The seed is strong."

He wanted everyone to know
what a good, strong boy

his son would grow up to be.

Look at him,
the lord of all the Vale.

Lysa,

you wrote me about the Lannisters,

Not to bring one here!

Mummy. . .

- is that the bad man?
- It is.

(Chuckles)

He's little.

(Lysa) He's Tyrion the Imp,
of House Lannister.

He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the King!

Oh, did I kill him too?

- I've been a very busy man.
- You will watch your tongue!

These men are knights of the Vale.

Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

Every one of them would die for me.

lf any harm comes to me,
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

You can't hurt us.
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mummy!

- TeII him!
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy.

He's just trying to frighten us.
Lannisters are aII Iiars.

No one will hurt my baby.

Mummy. . .

I want to see the bad man fly.

- Perhaps you will, my little love.
- This man is my prisoner.

I will not have him harmed.

Ser Vardis,

my sister's guest is weary.

Take him down below
so he can rest.

Introduce him to Mord.

You go sleep, dwarf man. (Chuckles)

Sleep good, little dwarf man!

(Laughs)

(Slams, lock clunks)

(Wind whistling)

Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

- He adores the man.
- You're jealous.

- Are you sure this won't hurt?
- Only if I slip.

(Scraping)

- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hm.

If you want hairless,
maybe you should find a little boy.

I want you.

My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

He treats me as if I'm a spoilt child.

Oh, and you're not?

Loras TyreII,
the Knight of the Flowers?

How many wars have you fought in?

Oh, and how much did your father spend
on that armor of yours?

Hold still.

All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis
is how l'm not tough enough,

how I squirm at the sight of blood.

You did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the meIee.

His eye was dangIing
out of the damn socket!

He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to fight.

Easy for you to say.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

(Groans) It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

I'm good because I work at it -

every day of my life
since I could hold a stick.

I could work at fighting all day, every day,
l'd stiII never be as good as you.

Yes, well, I guess we'll never know.

(Sighs)

- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

So how did it end up?

- The Targaryen girI wiII die?
- It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

Robert's rather tasteless about it.

Every time he talks about killing her,
l swear the tabIe rises six inches.

lt's a shame he can't muster
the same enthusiasm for his wife.

He does have a deep,
abiding lust for her money.

You have to give it
to the Lannisters - they may be

the most pompous, ponderous cunts
the gods ever suffered to walk the world,

but they do have
outrageous amounts of money.

- I have an outrageous amount of money.
- Not as much as the Lannisters.

(Laughs) But a lot more than you.

Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.

Last time we were out there
for two weeks.

Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.

Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

- And he's the king.
- Hmm.

- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.

And he used to be good at it.

Do you know who should be king?

- Be serious.
- l am.

My father could be your bank.

I've never fought in a war before,

- but I'd fight for you.
- I'm fourth in line.

And where's Robert
in the line of royal succession?

Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight.

- Stannis?
- Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

He's still my older brother.

- (Gasps) What are you doing?!
- Look at it.

- You cut me.
- It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

Sometimes a little spills.

lf you become king,
you're going to see a lot of this.

You need to get used to it.

Go on. Look.

People love you.

They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

They want to be near you.

You're wiIIing to do
what needs to be done,

but you don't gloat over it.

You don't love killing.

Where is it written that power
is the sole province of the worst?

That thrones are only made
for the hated and the feared?

You would be a wonderful king.

(Kissing and sucking sounds)

(Door creaks)

l'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

You seemed so good together.

I'm glad I could do something
to make you happy.

Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pieces.

l suppose this is where you teII me
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

No.

He's not serious enough.

I'll say this for Ned Stark -
he's serious enough.

(Robert) Hmm.

Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

I don't know.

But I do know this -

if the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea. . .

we won't be able to stop them.

The Dothraki don't sail.
Every chiId knows that.

They don't have discipline.
They don't have armor.

- They don't have siege weapons.
- It's a neat little trick you do -

you move your Iips
and your father's voice comes out.

(Chuckles softly) Is my father wrong?

Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.

We hole up in our castles.

A wise move -

onIy a fooI wouId meet
the Dothraki in an open field.

They leave us in our castles.

They go from town to town,
Iooting and burning,

kiIIing every man
who can't hide behind a stone wall,

stealing all our crops and livestock,

enslaving all our women and children.

How Iong do the peopIe
of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind

their absentee king,
their cowardly king

hiding behind high walls?

When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen

is the rightful monarch after all?

We still outnumber them.

Which is the bigger number -
five or one?

Five.

Five. . .

One.

One army - a real army

united behind one leader
with one purpose.

Our purpose died with the Mad King.

Now we've got as many armies

as there are men
with gold in their purse.

And everybody wants
something different.

Your father wants to own the world.

Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.

What do you want?

We haven't had
a real fight in nine years.

Backstabbing doesn't prepare you
for a fight.

And that's all the realm is now -

backstabbing and scheming

and arse-licking
and money-grubbing.

Sometimes I don't know
what hoIds it together.

- Our marriage.
- (Laughs)

Ah, so here we sit,

1 7 years Iater,
holding it all together.

Don't you get tired?

Every day.

How long can hate
hold a thing together?

Well, 1 7 years is quite a long time.

Yes, it is.

What was she like?

You've never asked
about her, not once.

Why not?

At first, just saying her name
even in private

felt like I was breathing life
back into her.

I thought if I didn't talk about her,
she'd just fade away for you.

When I realized
that wasn't going to happen,

I refused to ask out of spite.

I didn't want to give you the satisfaction
of thinking I cared enough to ask.

And eventuaIIy it became cIear
that my spite didn't mean anything to you.

As far as l couId teII,
you actually enjoyed it.

So why now?

What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost
do to either of us

that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

You want to know the horrible truth?

I can't even remember
what she Iooked Iike.

I only know she was
the one thing I ever wanted.

Someone took her away from me,

and seven kingdoms
couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

I felt something
for you once, you know?

I know.

Even after we lost our first boy.

For quite a while, actually.

Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

No.

Does that make you feel better or worse?

It doesn't make me feel anything.

(Door opens, closes)

She looks like him,

don't she, my lord?

She has his nose,
his bIack hair.

Aye.

Tell him when you see him, my lord.

lf it pIease you,
tell him how beautiful she is.

- l wiII.
- And tell him I've been with no one else.

l swear it, my Iord,
by the old gods and new.

I don't want no jewels or nothing,

just him.

The king was always good to me.

When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

- what did he want?
- He wasn't that sort of man, my lord.

He just wanted to know
if the chiId was happy,

healthy.

Looks healthy enough to me.

The girl shall want for nothing.

Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,

I've found.

Whores rarely sink.

What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?

Well, he has more than you, for a start.

- (Ned) How many?
- Does it matter?

If you fuck enough women,
some of them will give you presents.

And Jon Arryn
tracked them all down. Why?

He was the King's Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

He was overcome with fatherly love.

Come.

- Jory!
- My lord.

Such a small pack of wolves.

Stay back, ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

Was the Hand of the King.

Now I'm not sure what he is -
lord of somewhere very far away.

What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

Get back inside where it's safe.
l'm Iooking for my brother.

You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?

BIond hair,
sharp tongue, short man.

- l remember him weII.
- It seems he had some trouble on the road.

You wouldn't know
what happened to him, would you?

He was taken at my command
to answer for his crimes.

- (Littlefinger) My lords!
- (Horse neighs)

I'll bring the City Watch.

Come, Stark.
I'd rather you die sword in hand.

- If you threaten my lord again. . .
- Threaten?

As in, "I'm going to open your lord

"from baIIs to brains
and see what Starks are made of"?

You kill me,

your brother's a dead man.

You're right.

Take him alive. Kill his men.

(Roars)

Yah!

My brother, Lord Stark -
we want him back.

(Horse neighs)

(Breathing)

(Varys) You've seen better days, my lord.

Another visit?

It seems you're my last friend.

No, no, many still love you.

Sansa came to court this morning
to pIead for your Iife.

On her knees begging for me. Hm!

Did you laugh with the others?

You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing I want.

I don't know what you want.

I've given up trying to guess.

When I was still a boy -

before they cut my balls off with a hot knife -

I traveled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

The same is true at court.

I am the master of whisperers.

My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scrupIes.

I'm a good actor, my lord.

Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

I could.

But will I?

- No.
- (Laughs)

As I said, I'm no hero.

What do you want? Tell me.

No riddles, no stories. . .
Tell me, what do you want?

Peace.

Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? LoyaI Iad.

Fighting for his father's freedom.

Robb?

He's just a boy.

Boys have been conquerors before.

But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's. . . the late king's brother.

Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.

He is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by rights.

(Varys tuts)

Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
lt wouId be a shame to throw it away.

Cersei is no fool.

She knows a tame wolf
is more use to her than a dead one.

You want me to serve the woman who
murdered my king, who butchered my men,

who crippled my son?

I want you to serve the realm!

Tell the queen you will confess
your viIe treason,

tell your son to lay down his sword

and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

Cersei knows you as a man of honor.

If you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

I believe she will allow you
to take the bIack

and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.

(Chuckles)

You think my Iife
is some precious thing to me?

That I would trade my honor
for a few more years of. . .

Of what?

You grew up with actors.

You learned their craft and you learnt it well.

But I grew up with soldiers.

I learned how to die a long time ago.

Pity.

Such a pity.

What of your daughter's life, my lord?

Is that a precious thing to you?

(Water dripping)

(Cawing)

(Arrow whooshes)

It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

- Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
- (Catelyn) Keep shooting them down.

We can't risk Lord Walder sending
word of your movements to the Lannisters.

He's Grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

(Greatjon) Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

Look.

(Robb) Father rots in a dungeon.

How long before they take his head?

We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

(Greatjon) Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

The Freys have
held the crossing for 600 years,

and for 600 years
they have never failed to exact their toll.

Have my horse saddled and ready.

Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you
to the Lannisters as he Iikes.

Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.

Whatever it took.

If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.

I agree.

- l'II go.
- (Theon) You can't!

I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.
He would never harm me.

(Greatjon) Unless there was a profit in it.

What do you want?

It is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my Iord.

Oh, spare me.

Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

What am I supposed to do with you?

Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here. . .

Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until I die. Do I look dead to you?

- Father, pIease. . .
- I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.

All right, you come forward.

(Smacking kiss)

There.
Now that I've observed the courtesies,

perhaps my sons will do me the honor
of shutting their mouths.

Is there somewhere we can talk?

We're talking right now.

Fine.

Out! All of you!

- Oh!
- You too.

You see that?

Fifteen, she is.

A little flower.

And her honey's all mine. (Chuckles)

I'm sure she will give you many sons.

Huh.
Your father didn't come to the wedding.

He is quite ill, my lord.

Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.

Or the one before that.

Your family has always pissed on me.

- My Iord, l. . .
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

The fine Lord Tully would never marry
any of his children to mine.

- I'm sure there were reasons. . .
- l didn't need reasons.

I needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

Why are you here?

To ask you. . .

to open your gates, my lord. . .

so my son and his bannermen
may cross the Trident and be on their way.

- Why shouId l Iet him?
- If you could climb your own battlements,

you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

They'II be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

You swore an oath to my father.

Oh, yes, I said some words.

And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if l remember right.

Joffrey's king now,

which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebeIs, it seems to me.

lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish,
I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.

Give me one good reason why I should
waste a single thought on any of you?

- (Man) And. . .engage!
- (Wind howIs)

(Door slams)

When does Aemon think
you'll be able to use that hand?

- Soon, he says.
- Good.

You'll be ready for this, then.

l thought a woIf was more
appropriate for you than a bear. . .

so I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.

This is Valyrian steel.

It was my father's sword,
his father before him.

The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

It was meant for my son Jorah.

He brought dishonor to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword

before he fled from Westeros.

- My lord, you honor me, but I can't. . .
- Oh, you can.

And you will.

l wouIdn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you and your beast.

A bloody dead man tried to kill me.

So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

- Is that understood?
- Yes, my Iord.

Right.

Now, don't think this means I approve
of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.

That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.

I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.

No, you won't.
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

The hand that your wolf tore off
that thing's wrist. . .

l've, uh, ordered Thorne
to lay it at the feet of this. . .

boy king.

That should get young Joffrey's attention.

And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thorne.

Now go and put your sword somewhere safe. . .

and bring me my supper.

Yes, my lord.

- Well done.
- Well done.

You earned that, Snow.

Well done.

Go on, let's have a look.

- At what?
- (Grenn) The sword! Show us the sword.

(All) Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

(Laughter, cheering)

- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

(Laughter, excited chatter)

Come on,
I want to have a look at it in the light.

(Pyp) Give it here!

What is it?

- l. . .
- Look at its eyes.

- Give it.
- l can't.

You can't what?

I. . .

I'm really not supposed to say.

And yet you really want to say.

You want to say that. . .?

There was a raven.

I read the message to Maester Aemon.

It's your brother Robb.

What?

What about him?

He's heading south.

To war.

All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They'II keep him safe.

I should be there.

I should be with him.

(Hoofbeats approaching)

If we do that, they'll never get back across.

(Robb) Well?

What did he say?

Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

- His men are yours, as well.
- (Greatjon) Huh.

Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the
crossing against any who would pursue you.

What does he want in return?

You will be taking on his son Olyvar
as your personal squire.

- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, fine.

And?

And Arya. . .

wiII marry his son WaIdron
when they both come of age.

- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.

And?

And. . .

when the fighting is done. . .

you will marry one of his daughters.

Whichever you prefer.

He has a number
he thinks will be. . .suitable.

I see.

- Did you get a look at his daughters?
- (Snickering)

I did.

And?

One was. . .

Do you consent?

- Can I refuse?
- Not if you want to cross.

Then I consent.

(Chuckles)

(Cawing)

Sam said you wanted to see me?

I did indeed.

Perhaps you would
be kind enough to assist me.

Tell me, did you ever wonder
why the men of the Night's Watch

take no wives and father no children?

No.

So they will not love.

Love is the death of duty.

If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose. . .

between honor on the one hand. . .

and those he loves on the other,

what would he do?

He. . . He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

Then Lord Stark is one man in 1 0,000.

Most of us are not so strong.

What is honor. . .

compared to a woman's love?

And what is duty. . .

against the feel
of a newborn son in your arms?

Or a brother's smile?

Sam told you.

We're all human.

Oh, we aII do our duty
when there's no cost to it.

Honor comes easy then.

Yet. . .

sooner or later. . .

in every man's life. . .

there comes a day when it is not easy.

A day when he must choose.

And this is my day?

Is that what you're saying?

Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.

- l know.
- You do not know.

No one knows.

I may be a bastard,

but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

(Chuckles)

The gods were crueI
when they saw fit to test my vows.

They waited till I was old.

What couId l do when the ravens
brought the news from the South. . .

the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

I was helpless. . .

blind, frail.

But. . .

when I heard they had
killed my brother's son. . .

and his poor son. . .

and the children!

Even the little children.

Who are you?

My father was Maekar,

the first of his name.

My brother Aegon reigned after him. . .

when I had refused the throne.

And he was followed by his son Aerys. . .

whom they called the Mad King.

You're Aemon Targaryen.

I'm a maester of the Citadel,

bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.

I will not tell you. . .to stay or go.

You must make that choice yourself. . .

and live with it for the rest of your days.

As I have.

My lord. . .

My sun and stars. . .

Drogo.

(Mutters)

(Grunts)

(Speaks Dothraki)

My horse. . .

Blood of my blood. . .

No, I must ride.

He fell from his horse.

A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest.

We've ridden far enough today.
We'll camp here.

This is no place to camp.

A woman does not give us orders.
Not even a KhaIeesi.

We'll camp here.
Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.

You do not command me, Khaleesi.

Find Mirri Maz Duur.
Bring her to me.

The witch?
I'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.

Bring her to me unharmed
or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.

Hyah! Hyah!

(Kevan) Our scouts tell us the Stark host
has moved south from the Twins

with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

They're a day's march north.

The boy may lack experience and sense,

but he does have a certain mindless. . .

- provincial courage.
- Ah.

Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

l do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battleaxes.

Heavy black steel, double-sided.

Shagga likes axes.

When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.

Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

(Kevan) They do seem rather ferocious.

(Tyrion) Ferocious?

Last night. . .a Moon Brother
stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother
and opened his throat.

Bronn managed to keep Shagga
from chopping off the dead man's cock,

which was fortunate, but even still,
UIf is demanding bIood money,

which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

When soIdiers Iack discipIine,
the fault lies with their commander.

Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detrimental to the war effort.

There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

It appears I'm not hungry after all.

Excuse me, my lords.

Where did you find one so pretty
at this hour?

- l took her.
- Took her?

- From whom?
- From, uh. . .

Ser. . . What's his name?

- l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?

He said something.

Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.

We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

Oh, well. (Sighs)

l, uh. . .
think I'll go and find myself one.

Who are you?

Who would you like me to be?

What did your mother call you?

Shae. What did your mother call you?

My mother died giving birth to me.

Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

For. . .

What do you want from me?

What do I want from you?

(Sighs) I want you to share my tent.

I want you to pour my wine,
Iaugh at my jokes,

rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ride.

I want you to take no other man to bed
for as Iong as we're together.

And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.

Which it may well be.

And what do I get?

One - safety.

No one wiII hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

Two - the pleasure of my company,

which I have heard is spectacular.

Who told you this?
Women you paid?

And three. . .

more gold than you can spend
if you Iived a thousand years.

Do you accept my proposal?

Let's start with your last night in this world.

(Muttering)

(Jorah) Khaleesi.

Come.

He's very strong.

No one understands how strong he is.

(Daenerys gasps)

- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

He can't. I won't let him.

Even a queen doesn't have that power.

We must go quickIy.
I've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

Doth. . .

Even if. . .

Even if he dies. . .

why would I run?

l am khaIeesi, and my. . .
my son will be khal after Drogo.

This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood.

Here they only honor strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.

Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.

He won't want any rivals.

Your boy will be plucked from your breast
and given to the dogs.

I won't. . . leave him.

The wound has festered.

You did this, witch.

Stop it!

I don't want her hurt.

No? No?
You don't want her hurt?

Pray we don't hurt you, too.
You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.

Rein in your tongue.
She is still your Khaleesi.

Only while the blood of my blood lives.

When he dies, she is nothing.

l have never been nothing.
I am the blood of the dragon.

The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

I think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.

I think you're right.

- You've saved me once more.
- And now you must save him.

He's beyond the healer's skills.

All I can do is ease his path.

Save him and I will free you. I swear it.

You must know a way.

Some. . .

Some magic.

There is a spell.

Some would say death is cleaner.

Do it.

Save him.

- There is a price.
- You'll have gold, whatever you want.

It's not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.

Only death pays for life.

My death?

No, not your death, Khaleesi.

Bring me his horse.

(Whinnying)

Khaleesi, do not do this thing.

- Let me kiII this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your khal.

This is bloodmagic.
lt is forbidden.

I am your khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

(Recites spell)

Go. Now.

- Take her and leave.
- Uh-uh.

Take her!

You must go also, lady. Once I begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.

The dead will dance here tonight.

No one will enter.

(Recites spell)

- (Horse thuds)
- Bring him back to me.

(Singing)

What have you done?

I have to save him.

We could have been 1 0 miles
away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.

- You would have been safe.
- (Grunts)

(Demonic shrieking)

(Qotho speaks Dothraki)

This must not be.

This must be.

Witch.

(Speaks Dothraki)

No, you can't.

- (Grunts)
- Khaleesi!

No further, horselord.

(Sobbing)

(Singing continues)

Are you hurt?

- The baby. . .
- Hmm?

- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come. They say she is cursed.

They'll come or I'll have their heads.

(Groans)

The witch - she can bring baby.
l hear her say so.

(Singing, demonic bellowing)

(Singing, bellowing continues)

(Shae) Are you in agony, my lion?

- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.

- Ah!
- (Laughter)

Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

- Just used to it.
- Drink.

(Tyrion) Let's play a new game.

There's a Braavosi knife game
l couId teach you.

Does it involve the potential
for Iosing fingers?

- Not if you win.
- No!

No fire games, no knife games.

- Let's do something I'm good at.
- What are you good at?

I happen to be a great judge of character.

- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.

Here's how it works -
I make a statement about your past.

If I'm right, you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

I don't want to play this game.

Fine. Bronn first.

Your father beat you.

But my mother hit harder.

You killed your first man
before you were 1 2.

It was a woman.

She swung an axe at me.

You've been north of the Wall.

What brought you up there?

- Work.
- And. . .

you once loved a woman many years ago,
but it turned out badIy

so you've never let yourself love again.

Oh, wait, that's me.

Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

I don't want to play.

It's fun! Look at the fun we're having.

Your mother was a whore.

Drink.

All right.

Your father Ieft the famiIy when
you were very young, never to return.

Drink.

- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Drink!

- (Bronn pours)
- Mm.

You wanted a different life.

You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

So, specifics. . .

You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

l don't beIieve the Iife
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

So. . .what's a lowborn girl to do?

Drink.

- Are you sure. . .
- Drink!

And don't talk about
my mother and father ever,

or I will carve your eyes from your head.

My dear lady,
if I have offended you, I apologize.

My turn.

Fine, fine.

Ask away.

Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

- Who were you in Iove with?
- That's not how the game works.

I don't care the way the game works.

Our lord here used to be married.

- Married?
- How did you hear that?

You hear lots of things
playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

Another night, perhaps.

Not another night. This night.

It's not a pleasant story.

Oh, maybe I will cry.

I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more
unpleasant stories than your lordship.

So. . .

I was 1 6. My brother Jaime and I were riding,
when we heard a scream.

She ran out onto the road,
clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.

Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
whiIe l wrapped her in my cIoak.

She was too scared to send off on her own,

so whiIe Jaime hunted down the rapers
I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

Her name was Tysha.

She was a wheelwright's orphan.

And she was hungry.

Together we finished off three chickens
and a flagon of wine.

Impossible as it seems, there was a time
when I was unaccustomed to wine.

I forgot how afraid I was around girls. . .

how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or. . .

look away embarrassed,

or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.

I forgot about everything but Tysha.

And somehow I found myself in her bed.

For three chickens, I should hope so.

lt didn't Iast Iong.
I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

But she was good to me.

She kissed me afterwards and. . .

sang me a song.

And by morning
I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon

and there you have it - man and wife.

For a fortnight anyway,
until the septon sobered up and told my father.

Well, I imagine that was the end of all that.

Not quite.

First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

The girl was a whore, you see.

Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers. . .all of it.

He thought it was time I had a woman.

After my brother confessed. . .

my father brought in my wife

and gave her to his guards.

He paid her well -
a silver for each man.

How many whores command
that kind of price?

He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

By the end, she had so much silver

that the coins were slipping through her fingers
and rolling on to the floor.

I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

You should have known she was a whore.

Really?

I was 1 6, drunk and in love.

A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours Iater.

As I said, I was young and stupid.

You are still young and stupid.

(Kissing)

(Galloping hoofbeats)

Hyah!

(Horse neighs)

(Distant shouting)

(Clattering)

- What is it? What do you want?
- You're sleeping through the war.

- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

They're a mile north.

- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.

If I die, weep for me.

You'll be dead.
How will you know?

I'll know.

Watch out! Move!

Out of the way!

- Move aside!
- (Neighing)

Stay low.

Stay low?

If you're lucky, no one will notice you.

I was born lucky.

Tribesmen of the Vale,

gather round!

Stone Crows!

BIack Ears!
Burned Men!

- Moon Brothers!
- (Man) And Painted Dogs!

- And Painted Dogs!
- (Men) Painted Dogs!

Your dominion over the Vale begins now!

Onward, to claim what is yours!

Half man! Half man!

(All) Half man! Half man!

Half man! Half man!

To battle!

(Yelling)

(Horse neighing, echoes)

(Muffled shouts)

(Wagon rumbling)

(Bronn) You're a shit warrior.

I'm alive?

You're alive.

Did we win?

We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

(Screaming)

(Blades slashing)
(Men screaming)

How did our tribesmen do?

Yeah, good.

(Tyrion) It's nice to see them getting along.
(Tywin) You're wounded.

Good of you to notice.

I hear we won.

Huh! The scouts were wrong.

There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20.

Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

He wasn't here.

Where was he?

With his other 1 8,000 men.

And where are they?

- We should go, my lady.
- No!

My lady!

- (Neighing)
- Hyah! Hyah!

(Pants, grunts)

By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.

Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword,
but l seem to have Iost it.

It is not your sword I want.

Give me my daughters back.

Give me my husband.

I've lost them too, I'm afraid.

(Theon) Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us aIive than dead.

(Catelyn) Take him away and put him in irons.

We could end this war right now, boy,

save thousands of lives.

You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

Swords or lances, teeth, nails -

choose your weapons
and let's end this here and now.

If we do it your way, Kingslayer. . .

you'd win.

We're not doing it your way.

(Greatjon) Come on, pretty man.

(Laughter, cheering)

- l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
- The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

One victory does not make us conquerors.

Did we free my father?

Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?

Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

This war is far from over.

(Bell tolling)

Could I have one?

A lemon one. . .or any of them.

Three coppers.

- How about a nice fat pigeon?
- Oh, piss off now. Go on.

Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

Piss off!

Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

The Hand of the King.

(Crowd clamoring)

(Clamoring intensifies)

(Jeering)

- Traitor!
- Coward!

(Ned mutters) Baelor.

Baelor!

Traitor! Traitor!

(Crowd quietens)

I am Eddard Stark. . .

Lord of Winterfell. . .

and Hand of the King.

I come before you to confess my treason. . .

in the sight of gods and men.

I betrayed the faith of my king. . .

and the trust of my friend Robert.

I swore to protect and defend his children.

But before his blood was cold. . .

I plotted to murder his son. . .

and seize the throne for myself.

(Jeering, clamoring)

Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what I say. . .

Joffrey Baratheon. . .

is the one true heir to the Iron Throne. . .

by the grace of all the gods,

Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. . .

and Protector of the Realm.

(Crowd jeering)

(Gasps)

As. . . As we sin. . .

so do we suffer.

This man has confessed his crimes. . .

in sight of gods and men.

The gods are just. . .

but beloved Baelor taught us. . .

they can also be merciful.

What is to be done
with this traitor, Your Grace?

(Jeering, catcalls)

My mother wishes me
to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.

Stripped of all titles and powers,
he would serve the realm in permanent exile.

And my Lady Sansa. . .
has begged mercy for her father.

But they have the soft hearts of women.

So long as I am your king. . .

treason shall never go unpunished.

Ser Ilyn. . .

bring me his head!

- No!
- (Crowd roars)

Someone stop him!

My son, this is madness.

(Slynt) Put him down!

- Don't Iook!
- Let me go! Let me go!

Shut your mouth!
Look at me! Look at me!

Stop! Daddy! Stop!

- No! No!
- (Crowd) Traitor!

(Sansa) Stop!

Stop him! Stop!

(Clamoring fades)

(Breathes slowly)

(Wings fluttering)
