Mr. Soprano?

Yeah.

Have a seat.

My understanding from Dr. Cusamano,
your physician...

...is that you collapsed.

Possibly a panic attack?
You were unable to breathe?

They said it was a panic attack.

The blood and neurological
work came back negative.

And they sent me here.

You don't agree that
you had a panic attack?

How are you feeling now?

Good.

Fine. Back at work.

What line of work are you in?

Waste management consultant.

It's impossible for me to
talk to a psychiatrist.

Any thoughts at all
on why you blacked out?

I don't know. Stress, maybe.

About what?

I don't know.

The morning I got sick,
I'd been thinking.

It's good to be in something
from the ground floor.

And I came too late for that, I know.

But lately, I'm getting the feeling
that I came in at the end.

The best is over.

Many Americans, I think,
feel that way.

I think about my father.

He never reached the heights like me.

In a lot of ways he had it better.

He had his people, they had
their standards, they had pride.

Today, what do we got?

Did you have these feelings of loss
more acutely before you collapsed?

I don't know.

A couple months before, these
two ducks landed in my pool.

It was amazing. They're from Canada,
and it was mating season.

They had some ducklings.

Come on, get some bread.

My daughter's friend was there
to drive her to school.

- Meadow, your father with those ducks.
- The yard smells like duck poo.

You gotta have more than
just juice for breakfast.

You need brain food for school.
Happy birthday, handsome.

- Thirteen.
- He doesn't act it.

The male and female duck made
a home in your pool and did it?

Get out of here! You're so gross!

You want some of
last night's sfogliatelle?

- Get out of here with that fat.
- One bite.

How do you stay skinny,
Mrs. Soprano?

Him, with those ducks.

If you don't like that ramp, I'll
build another. Maybe it's the wood.

Look, they're trying to fly.

- National Geographic, Dad.
- Yeah, super.

- You showed us yesterday.
- This is great!

Now my wife feels
this friend is a bad influence.

It's so cool you're coming to Aspen
with my family at Christmas.

Last year I saw Skeet Ulrich,
as close as from where you're sitting.

Miss Meadow, we made a deal.

Keep your grades up and your curfew
until Christmas, then you get to go.

I know that.

Good morning.

- Hey, Mr. Soprano.
- We're late, Dad.

- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Dad.

You're gonna be home tonight for
Anthony Jr.'s birthday party, right?

Birdman, hello!

Yeah, yeah.
I'll get home early from work.

I'm not talking about work.

This won't work.
I can't talk about my personal life.

Finish telling me
about the day you collapsed.

I drove to work with my nephew.
He's learning the business.

He's an example of what
I was talking about before.

Did you call Triborough Towers
about the hauling contract?

I got home too late.
I didn't want to wake the man up.

Did you get up early and call?
He's always in his office by 6.

I was nauseous. My mother told me
I shouldn't even come in today.

Bear in mind, this is a kid who
just bought himself a $60,000 Lexus.

- There's that guy Mahaffey.
- Get out.

Right there.
Next to the boo-boo in pink.

Back up.

My friend Mahaffey
pulling his taffy. Hello.

We saw this guy.

There was an outstanding loan.

One second.

I don't know
where this story is going.

But there are a few ethical ground
rules we should get out of the way.

What you tell me here...

...falls under
doctor/patient confidentiality.

Except if I was...

If I was to hear, let's say,
a murder was to take place...

Not that it would, but if.

If a patient tells me a story
where someone's going to get hurt...

...I'm supposed to go
to the authorities.

Technically.

You said you were in waste management.

The environment.

Dr. Cusamano, besides
being your family physician...

...is also your next-door neighbor.

See what I'm saying?

I don't know what happened
with this fellow, I'm...

I'm just saying.

Nothing.

We had coffee.

Alex!

Help!

Security! Help!

Oh, shit.

Asshole!

Tony!

Wait up!

Security!

You all right?

My leg is broken.
The bone's coming through.

Let me see.

I'll give you a fucking bone,
you prick! Where's my fucking money?

So you had coffee.

Right.

You son of a bitch, motherfucker.

- What are you doing? Get over here!
- That's $3000 here. $3000.

Go ahead.

Where's the fucking money?

I'll get the money!

I know you will.

You should get a cork in your mouth
because you say I'm nothing...

...compared to the people
who used to run things. Prick.

I'm nothing.

Shut up.

What are you crying about? HMO.
You're covered.

You prick.

Degenerate fucking gambler.

Go on.

Next, I had a meeting.

I was called in to consult by
a garbage-hauling company I represent.

What's the story
with Triborough Towers?

The manager wants the contract
with Dick, but this Kolar Sanitation...

Another nationwide company.

The Kolar brothers. Czechoslovakian
immigrants or some shit.

These Polacks will haul
paper, plastic and aluminum...

...for 7000 a month less than Dick.

They pay us 40 times the monthly
for stealing a stop.

That's the thing. They won't.

Says if he can tell the commie bosses
in Czechoslovakia to fuck off...

...he can fucking tell us.

- I give up.
- Fucking garbage business.

Yeah, I know. It's all changing.

Let me see what I can do.

Sure? You over your stomachache?

- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

What are you doing here?

Gabriella sends me
down here for the capocollo.

Hey, T, let me ask you something.

Didn't you used to go to school
with Artie Bucco?

A situation came up.
It involves my uncle.

I can't go into details.

That's fine.

But I will say this. My uncle
adds to my general stress level.

It's none of my business...

...but down at the club,
the word is...

...your Uncle Junior
is gonna whack Pussy Malanga.

He's gonna do it
at Artie Bucco's restaurant.

Hey, boys. How are you?

Don't move.

- Uncle Junior, how you doing?
- Hey.

Hey, good to see you.

Hi there, Chris.

I was talking about you. It's Anthony
Jr.'s birthday tonight, right?

Don't buy him anything big,
we overindulge him. Okay?

Hey!

- Artie, how's your rash?
- It's itchy.

Come here.

- Good to see you. You'll come over?
- Yeah, have a seat.

You know what it means, one of
these mutts gets wet in here?

It'll ruin his business.

You better sit down with your uncle.

Uncle Junior's my father's brother.

A good guy, just getting old, cranky.

He used to take me to Yankee games
when I was a kid.

I love my uncle.

At the same time, when I was young...

...he told my girl cousins
I would never be a varsity athlete.

Frankly, that was a tremendous blow
to my self-esteem.

Who's there?

It's me, Ma.

Who are you?

Ma, open the door.

- Anthony?
- Yeah, it's me. Open the door.

Hi, how are you?

Jeez, Ma. Get some air in here.

Did you lock the door?

- Yeah, I did.
- Somebody called here last night.

- After dark.
- Who?

You think I'd answer?
It was dark out.

Ma, I'll never understand that.

The phone is auditory.
Dark is an eye thing.

I could understand not going out.
You could get jumped.

But the phone?

Listen to him, he knows everything.
You want some lunch? I got eggplant.

No, no, I just ate.
Know who I just ran into?

Uncle Jun.

Oh, that one. You think he ever
comes to see his sister-in-law?

Remember Artie Bucco?

Kid I went to elementary school with?

Oh, yeah, I still see his mother.

She tells me...

...he calls her every day.

Well, Uncle Junior's gonna
make a problem for Artie.

Could affect his livelihood.

- What's that?
- CD player.

For who?

For me?

- I don't want it.
- You don't want it.

You love music, all the old stuff's
on CD. Your favorites.

"Pajama Game," Connie Francis.

Here.

Come on.

Move around a bit.
It's good for you.

What? No.

- Come on. Come on.
- Stop it.

You need to occupy your mind. When
Dad died, you were gonna do things.

- He was a saint.
- I know he was. But he's gone.

You were gonna travel, volunteer.
You've done nothing.

Stop telling me how to live my life.
Just shut up.

I just worry...

And don't start with that
nursing home business again.

It's not a nursing home,
it's a retirement community!

You interact with seniors
your own age, go places, do things!

I've seen women in nursing homes...

...in these wheelchairs,
babbling like idiots!

Here, eat your eggplant.

I told you, I already ate lunch.

All right, listen.

You just speak to Uncle Junior
about Artie, okay?

He respects you.
He'll listen to you.

If your uncle has business with Arthur,
he knows what he's doing.

And I don't?

Well, all I know is...

...daughters are better at taking care
of their mothers than sons.

Yeah, and I bought CDs
for a broken record.

I expect to see you at Anthony Jr.'s
party with your baked ziti.

Only if I'm picked up
and I'm brought back home.

I don't drive
when they're predicting rain.

You're healthy.
It's good for you to drive.

Use it or lose it.
I gotta go to work.

Sure...

...run off!

And that night was
my son's birthday party.

My wife invites the priest.
He's always at the house.

- Hey, Tony.
- How you doing?

- You like crème anglaise?
- You bless it, I'll eat it.

She's not coming.

- Who?
- Grandma just called.

She started crying and hung up.

- She needs a purpose.
- She's tougher than you think.

- So, what? No fucking ziti now?
- Hey!

At first it felt like...

...ginger ale in my skull.

- Mom, Daddy just fell! Mom!
- Oh, my God. Tony!

Get back!

Daddy! Dad!

Anthony Jr., call 911.

Dr. Cusamano put me in the
hospital, gave me every kind of test.

Okay.

Hey! Carm.

- Thought you might want some company.
- Yeah.

6:30 in the morning.

- How are the kids?
- They're worried about you.

I told Anthony Jr.
we'd rain-check his birthday.

Think I got a brain tumor?

Well, we're gonna find out.

What a bedside manner.
Very encouraging.

What, are you gonna not know?

We had some good times.
Had some good years.

Here he goes with the nostalgia.

No marriage is perfect.

Having that goomar on the side helps.

I'm not seeing her anymore.
What about that priest?

Don't even go there.

Father is a spiritual mentor.
He's making me a better Catholic!

Well, we all got different needs.

What's different between us is,
you're going to hell when you die.

My nephew, Christopher, was
handling the garbage contract problem.

But on this I will also
not go into detail.

Emil Kolar.

Chris Moltisanti.

Hey, in Czech Republic too,
we love pork.

You ever have our sausages?

No. I thought the only sausages
they had was Italian and Jimmy Dean's.

See what you learn when you
cross cultures and shit?

My Uncle Evzen doesn't know I came.

If we make any progress,
I'll tell him.

Hey, we have to make progress, Emil.
We gotta stop the madness.

Business is changing,
we're the younger generation.

We have issues in common.

Emil.

Where'd you go to high school?
Was it Poland?

I'm not Polish.

Czechoslovakian,
that's a type of Polack, right?

We came here when I was 9.
I went to West Essex.

You used to play my cousin Gregory
in football, he...

- Where's the stuff?
- Yes, yes, yes.

The reason for the visit.
We got it all deployed for you.

Taste the wares, Emil.

Emil.

The doctors kept me hanging
about the tests, as doctors will do.

So my uncle and I played
a round of golf and had lunch.

You keep mentioning your uncle.
What's the problem?

Who do you think you are?

I'm the person who says
how things go, that's who.

Artie's dinner business is nice,
upscale people from the suburbs.

Don't ruin his life.

Vesuvio is where Pussy feels safe.

He's been eating here all his life.

You kill him someplace else.

You may run North Jersey,
but you don't run your uncle!

How many fucking hours did I spend
playing catch with you?

Can we focus more
on your immediate family?

My wife and daughter
were not getting along.

Darn, these laser discs
are incredible!

Tony watches Godfather II. He says
it looks just like the movie theater.

Gordon Willis.
Tony prefers II, not I?

He likes where Vito
goes back to Sicily.

With III, he was like,
"What happened?"

Where does Tony rank Goodfellas?

What, do you have raccoons?

- Somebody's jimmying a window.
- What?

You have all these security
lights, who would try and?

Oh, no. Jeez, Louise!

Hold it!

Meadow.

I noticed the glass rattles every time
I walk to the laundry room.

Do we have any putty?

Don't give me that.
You snuck out!

What's going on?

You locked my bedroom window
so I'd get caught.

Normal people thought you were
upstairs doing your homework!

You have become a master
of lying and conniving.

I know I'm grounded.

Patrick's swim meet is tomorrow,
and he needed me!

Grounded for this?
Oh, no, you're not grounded.

You're not going to Aspen
with Hunter Scangarelo!

Yes!

But this shit I'm telling you...

...it'll all blow over.

Didn't you admit to Dr. Cusamano
that you were feeling depressed?

"Melfi."

What part of the boot you from?

Dr. Melfi.

My father's people were from Caserta.

Avellino.

My mother would have loved it
if you and I got together.

Anxiety attacks are legitimate
psychiatric emergencies.

Suppose you were driving
and you passed out.

Let me tell you something.

Nowadays, everybody's gotta go
to shrinks and counselors...

...and go on Sally Jessy Raphael
and talk about their problems.

Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?

The strong, silent type?

That was an American.

He wasn't in touch
with his feelings.

They didn't realize once they got Gary
Cooper in touch with his feelings...

...they wouldn't be able
to shut him up!

So it's dysfunction this and
that! And dysfunction va fangool!

You have strong feelings about this.

I had a semester and a half
of college...

...so I understand Freud.
I understand therapy as a concept.

But in my world, it does not go down.

Could I be happier?
Yeah. Yeah. Who couldn't?

Do you feel depressed?

Do you feel depressed?

Since the ducks left...

I guess.

The ducks that preceded
your losing consciousness.

Let's talk about them.

You can't blame T for being pissed.
You should have waited.

That's the last time I show
any fucking initiative.

Imagine how I felt?

T's running down the business...

...I fucking wet a guy
to keep one of our stops.

He's not running it down.
It's just getting harder in New York.

One.

Two.

Three.

Come on!

- This is fucked up.
- What, Pussy?

The Kolar uncle is gonna find the kid
dead on one of his bins...

...and get out of our
fucking business? No way.

"Louis Brassi sleeps with the fishes."

Luca Brassi.

- Luca.
- Whatever.

There's differences, Christopher.

From the Luca Brassi situation
and this?

Look, if the Kolars know the kid is
dead, it hardens their position.

Plus, now the cops are looking
for a fucking murderer.

What do you want to do?

He disappears.
He never comes home.

They know, but they don't know.

They hope maybe he'll turn up... if.

Come on. Let's get him.

Got him?

Take him to Staten Island,
I'll cut him up.

Pussy, you know, with T
collapsing at the birthday...

...what would you do
if he was, like, disabled?

Why would you even ask that?

Our lecture series in action.

Someone from the university
discussing...

...the novels of, I believe,
Zora Neale Hurston.

Didn't you just read her
in school, Med?

It's very nice.

You know, Grandma,
this place is neat.

You should really think about it.

This room was renovated last year.

What goes on behind there?

Those doors lead to our nursing unit.

This is a nursing home!

This is a residence,
but just in case...

No, you're not getting me
into a nursing home.

You're not listening
to what she's saying.

Women in wheelchairs,
babbling like idiots!

Ma, you're not listening.

You think you're so high and mighty,
don't you?

With your fancy office.

Anthony, people come here to die!

Oh, my God! Somebody get a doctor.

So you've come back for help.
Don't look at that as a defeat.

She's one of those who grew up
during the Depression.

But the Depression to her
was a trip to Six Flags.

There's that "D" word again.

Stay with your mother.

Now that my father's dead,
he's a saint.

When he was alive, nothing.

My dad was tough, he ran his own crew.

A guy like that and my mother
wore him down to a little nub.

He was a squeaking little gerbil
when he died.

Quite a formidable maternal presence.

I gotta be honest. I'm not getting
any satisfaction from my work, either.

Why?

Well, because of RICO.

- Is he your brother?
- No. The RICO Statutes.

Oh, of course, right.

You read the papers?

You know, the government's using
electronic surveillance...

...and various legal strategies
to squeeze my business.

Do you have any qualms about
how you actually make a living?

Yeah.

I find I have to be the sad clown.

Laughing on the outside...

...crying on the inside.

See, things are trending downward.

Used to be, a guy got pinched,
he took his prison jolt.

Everybody upheld a code of silence.

Nowadays, no values.

Guys today have no room
for the penal experience.

So everybody turns government witness.

I feel exhausted
just talking about it.

Well, with today's pharmacology,
no one needs to suffer...

...with feelings of
exhaustion and depression.

Here we go.
Here comes the Prozac.

Mahaffey doesn't have it.

What do you mean
he doesn't have it?

He doesn't have the money.

How can he not have the money?

The man does not have the money.

We ran the man over with the car.
T, himself.

The man has no wiggle room.
He's bled dry.

So...

...I hear Junior wants to
whack Pussy Bompensiero?

- Pussy Malanga.
- Oh, Little Pussy.

You think he's gonna
fuck with Big Pussy?

My Pussy?

Andrea.

Stay with drinks on the house
all night.

- Sorry, Mr. Dante.
- It's okay.

So your uncle resents
that you're the boss.

The sadness accrues.

Your uncle's had a hard-on
his whole life.

First, against your father,
his younger brother...

...because he was a made man
before him.

And now, you.

So, sure, he can't stomach
your telling him what to do.

Hesh, I love the man.

The man is driven in toto
by his insecurities.

I feel bad I was the messenger.

Your friend Artie,
with the restaurant.

Get him out of town.

That way the restaurant closes,
the hit goes down someplace else.

You old fucking Jew.

No wonder my old man
kept you around so long.

So what about this fucking Jew's
250 on Mahaffey's 100?

Mahaffey has a new business partner...

...you.

These HMOs pay out millions...

...to doctors, hospitals, whatever.

That MRI I had,
$2000 a pop.

Now, we give this Mahaffey a choice.

Either his company pays out
phony claims...

...to fake clinics we set up...

...or he pays Hesh
the 250 grand he owes him...

...which we know he cannot do.

Or it's a rainy night in Lyndhurst.

Very smart.
Could be major.

Could be as good as garbage.

- Garbage is our bread and butter.
- Was.

Miss Meadow!

So, Med.

I'm not going.

Every year, on this date,
since you were itty-bitty...

...Mom and Meadow get all dolled up...

...drive into New York Plaza Hotel
for tea under Eloise's portrait.

Look, where's yours?

I have too much homework.

Meadow, its our little tradition!

We always have so much fun!

To tell you the truth,
I felt it was dumb since I was 8!

I just go because you like it.

Here I thought this was something we
would do long after you got married...

...with girls of your own.

Hopefully I won't be
living around here by then.

You've got mail.

Meadow, you can't just lie and cheat
and break the rules you don't like!

What? You have something
you want to say?

Mom, do you have any idea how much
it means to go skiing in Aspen?

Do you think that'll
happen every year?

Like lame tea and scones
at the Plaza Hotel?

- Goodbye.
- Close my door, please.

Artie.

Give me a drop. Oh! A drop,
not a spurt. Soave, a drop!

- How are you?
- All right. Stir the meatballs.

- Could you help me out?
- Yeah, what do you need?

Cruise. Caribbean.

S.S. Sagafjord, 11th through the 29th.

Pair of tickets. I can't use them.

Can you take them off my hands?

- Where'd they come from?
- Comps.

Comps?

What does that mean?

As manager for the Kitchen
and Restaurant Workers Union...

...I administer the dental plan.
You listening to me?

A couple of dentists got together
and awarded me these tickets.

The problem is,
I can't get away those dates.

Here. When was your last vacation?

- Anthony, thank you.
- All right.

Mr. Soprano?

You cannot accept a gift
like that from Tony Soprano! No way!

Listen to me, Charmaine...

...if I stick my hand up the ass of
one more lobster without a break...

...I'm gonna go postal.

I don't even want to talk about it
anymore, please!

Art, Melissa, come on, honey.
It's time to go home.

You have to get away.
We have to get away for the marriage.

No! It's bad enough that these
mobsters patronize the place, okay?

So what? We're not connected.

Right. Because we just
turned down those tickets!

But the tickets were comps.
Tony is a labor leader.

Arthur, please. Grow up!

Does the mind not rebel at any
scenario under which dentists...

...are sending the don of New Jersey
first class on a Norwegian steamship?

Come on, Arthur, somebody donated
their kneecaps for those tickets!

Herman, there is no way I can
subvert my fucking company.

Have them pay claims for MRIs
that never happened?

- The paperwork will look real.
- How do I not get caught?

I hate to hear you knocking yourself.
You're a smart guy.

I'm depressed. I'm so fucking
depressed I can't eat, sleep.

- You on Prozac?
- Zoloft. It's similar.

- It's supposed to help with gambling.
- No shit.

This new generation
of antidepressants...

...are supposed to be useful
against compulsive behaviors.

That's a shame.

A medication comes along
after your gambling...

...gets your fucking hip
busted to shit.

I'm trying not to be cynical.

Your debt and the feelings surrounding
it is the source of all your problems.

I'm sorry I haven't paid you, Herman.

I know you are.

And I never meant to
denigrate Tony Soprano.

- Want to walk on the rocks?
- Crutches, I can't.

It's beautiful out there.
Come on, we'll help you.

I go out there to think.

Thanks, but no.

Let's try it.

What you were saying before
with the MRIs and...

T!

Dick's looking for you!

Hey, Tony, I just heard
from Triborough Towers.

The Kolar brothers withdrew their bid.

That's good. That's good.

Listen, by the way,
Artie Bucco's here to see you.

- I gotta go, guys.
- Take care.

Artie!

Artie, you all right?

- I can't.
- What are you talking about?

We discussed this.
You gotta leave town.

I'm sorry.

This is unacceptable.

I made a reservation two weeks ago.

Sir, people are not leaving, and there
are five parties ahead of you.

- So what would you like...?
- Can I help you?

I tore her a new one.

Why don't we just go
to another restaurant and eat?

We're here.

Mr. Soprano, how you doing?
Good to see you.

How you doing?

- Signora.
- Hello.

This way. Excuse me.

Sweetie-pie, I'm hungry.
Tony, where you going?

Hey. How are you?

Good.

You come here?

When possible.

Those decorating tips you gave me,
they really work.

Good.

How you doing?

Nils, Nils?

Do you know who that was?

Well, I mean, obviously you do.

What, is he a patient?

You know I can't say.

Decorating tips, yeah, right.

Nils, shut the fuck up.

Mr. Borglund, they're setting up
your table now.

Whoa.

Who was that woman at the restaurant?

My decorator.

What?
You're redoing the garbage dump?

That's funny. Hey, you better
not mess with that hat!

Come on, it's JFK's hat!
I bought it at that auction.

Give me that!

Irina, Jesus.

I know there is something more
intimate between you and her.

Nothing intimate. We just talk.

Mr. Soprano, buona sera.

We don't see you.
Where you been?

You know, sometimes...

...life is good.

Life is often good.

Regaleali, for example.

You've been in good spirits
the last couple days.

Carmela, there's something
I gotta confess.

What are you doing?

Getting my wine in position
to throw in your face!

You're always with the drama.

Confess already, please.
Get it over with!

I'm on Prozac.

Oh. Oh, my God.

I been seeing a therapist.

Oh, my God.
I think that's great.

I think that's wonderful!
I think that's so gutsy!

- Take it easy.
- But I think that's very wonderful.

You'd think I was Hannibal Lecter.

I think it's great.
Psychology doesn't address the soul.

But this is a start.
This is something.

Oh, I'm gonna shut up now.

I'll shut up now.

You're the only person who knows.

The only reason I'm telling you this
is because you're my wife.

You're the only person on this planet
that I'm completely honest with.

Oh, please.

Hey, goddamn it, I'm serious.

If the wrong person finds out,
I get a steel jacket...

...of antidepressant
in the back of the head.

I didn't realize you were so unhappy.

I don't know.

My mother...

You told him about your father, right?

- Who?
- Your therapist.

Yeah. Yeah, I told him.

Good. But your mother is the one.

I don't know, I just feel like lately
my life's out of balance.

Our existence on this earth
is a puzzle.

My own daughter hates me.

She doesn't hate you, Carm.

We were best friends.

Mothers and their daughters.
She'll come back to you.

- Hello?
- Jesus!

What's the matter, no social life?

Blow me.

Dad.

I brought you my primavera.
It's your favorite.

- Who is it?
- Christopher.

- Hey.
- Our friend is back in town.

"Little Pussy" Malanga,
confused with "Big Pussy" Bompensiero...

...had just returned from Florida...

So it's gonna go down soon?

Don't worry.
I got a way to put it to bed.

Come on, Meadow.

- Go, Falcons!
- Come on, let's go!

So when do you need this by?

Right away.

- Way to go, Meadow!
- Beautiful, beautiful!

I think I can get a party
like that together.

- Side out? That ball hit the line!
- What are you doing, ref?

Mom didn't come?

Didn't think you wanted her to.

The car's over there.

Hey, Mr. Dante.
See you, Heather.

You guys played a good game.

Heather Dante.
Where'd she get that spike?

Don't you think it's
unfair what Mom is doing?

Making this little
movie scene out of it.

"The Sad Mom Who Can't Even Come
to Her Daughter's Sports Event."

Dad?

Don't you think it's
totally out there?

I mean, my Aspen trip.
What is she thinking?

Dad?

It's been years since I've been here.

Dad, please talk to her, please.

God, this is so stupid.

Why are we sitting here?

Your mother thinks you have the
capacity to be a top student.

And I agree.

What do you guys want, perfection?

What are you looking at?

Your great-grandfather
and his brother Frank...

...they built this place.

Big whoop.

Stone and marble workers.
They came over here from Italy...

...and they built this place.

Yeah, right. Two guys.

No, they were two guys on a crew of,
you know, laborers.

They didn't design it...

...but they knew how to build it.

Now find two guys who can
put decent grout around your bathtub.

So I feel good.

So I don't know if I'm
gonna be needing to come back.

It's not the Prozac.

Why not?

You said you're thinking clearer and
your wife says you seem to be better?

It's not the medication.

Prozac takes weeks to build up
effective levels in the blood.

Well, what is it, then?

Coming here. Talking.

Hope comes in many forms.

Well, who's got time for that?

What is it you want to say to me?

I had a dream last night.

Uh...

My bellybutton was...

...a Phillips head screw...

...and I'm working unscrewing it...

...and when I get it unscrewed...

...my penis falls off.

You know, I pick it up and I'm holding
it and I'm running around...

...looking for the guy who used to
work on my Lincoln...

...so he can put it back on.

And you know, I'm holding it up...

...and this bird swoops down
and grabs it in its beak...

...and flies off with it.

What kind of bird?

I don't know. Sea gull or something.

A water bird?

I saw The Birds last week.
Think that planted the idea?

What else is a water bird?

Pelican, flamingo.

What about ducks?

Those goddamn ducks.

What is it about those ducks
that meant so much to you?

I don't know, it was a trip...

...having those wild creatures...

...come into my pool
and have their little babies.

I was sad to see them go.

Oh, Jesus, fuck. Now he's gonna cry.

Shit. Fuck me.

When the ducks gave birth to those
babies, they became a family.

You're right.

It's a link. A connection.

I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose my family...

...like I lost the ducks.

That's what I'm full of dread about.

It's always with me.

What are you so afraid's
going to happen?

I don't know.

You work so hard.

You work so damn hard
and to see your life's dream...

...burn down.

Look at it this way,
you collect the insurance.

You gotta say to yourself,
"It could have been worse."

How could it have been worse?
Fucking faulty stove!

Suppose people stopped coming,
ever think of that?

I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck.

He's right.
There's no insurance for that.

Why would people stop coming to the
restaurant? It's just catching on.

You know what I'm
figuring out lately?

Talking helps.

- That's right.
- He's right. He's right.

Hope... comes in many forms.

Absolutely.

Come on.

Here, hold this.

Artie.

Artie, come on.

Hey, hey.

Hey, look at me. Look at me.

I'll always help you.

Come on. Come on.

Go cook. Hey, let him cook.
He'll feel better.

Someday I'll tell him
we torched the restaurant.

All right, enough of this shit.
What's wrong?

You know, a simple...

..."Way to go, Chris, on the Triborough
Towers contract!" would have been nice.

That's it.

You're right.

You're right.

I have no defense.

That's how I was parented.
Never supported. Never complimented.

My cousin Gregory's girlfriend...

...is what they call a development
girl, out in Hollywood.

She said I could sell my life story,
make fucking millions.

I didn't do that.
I stuck it out with you.

I'll fucking kill you.
Are you gonna go Henry Hill on me now?

You know how many mobsters are selling
screenplays and screwing things up?

She said I could maybe
even play myself.

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

Forget Hollywood screenplays.
Forget those distractions, huh?

What, you think I haven't had offers?

We got work to do. New avenues.

Everything's gonna be all right
from here on in. Come on.

Look, it's a beautiful day.
What could be bad?

It's nice of you to pick me up
for the party, Junior.

- At least somebody cares about me.
- These kids today.

I suppose he thinks once he's
got me in a nursing home...

...I'll die faster and then
he won't have to drive me anywhere.

If his father was still alive...

...you can bet he'd show more
decency and respect for his mother.

Well, my brother John
was a man among men.

He was a saint.

Lots of things are different now
from Johnny's and my day.

What do you mean?

I'm not free to run my business
like I want.

Aw, isn't that awful.

Just this week, your son
stuck his hand in...

...and made it 100 times
more difficult for me.

Plus, he thumbs his nose at New York.

What are you gonna do?
He's part of a whole generation.

Do you remember the crazy hair?
And the dope?

Now it's fags in the military.

Stop it, Junior.
You're making me very upset!

I don't like to, Livia,
but I'm agita all the time.

And I'll tell you something else,
things are down all across the board.

A lot of friends of ours
are complaining.

We used to be recession-proof.
No more.

You can't blame it all
on the Justice Department.

Our friends say to me...

..."Junior, why don't you
take a larger hand in things?"

Something may have to be done, Livia,
about Tony.

I don't know.

There they are.
Hey, Ma, Uncle Jun.

You're using mesquite.
That makes the sausage taste peculiar.

- Hi, Grandma.
- Happy birthday, my big boy.

Carmela, my mother's here.

Everybody, let's eat.

AJ:
Here, take a swig.

And don't backwash.

Shit! Don't break it.

JARED:
It's time for the nuns' rosary.

AJ: This is 8th-grade history.
Stealing the sacramental wine?

JARED: It's not sacramental
till they bless it.

All clear!
Are you gonna confess this?

I'll tell them I stole something,
not what.

Go! Form it up!
Form it up, let's go, boys.

Hustle, hustle, hustle!

There we go, straight lines.
Straight lines.

There you go.

Soprano, DiCarlucci, shake a leg.

Jumping jacks.
Ten of them, count them down.

BOYS: Three, four, five...
AJ: Two, three...

BOYS: six, seven, eight...
AJ: four, five, six...

BOYS: nine, ten.
AJ: seven, eight, nine...

DiCarlucci, Barber, Soprano,
let's go! Sync up!

What's so funny? Care to share?

Sorry, Mr. Meskimmin.

[BLOWS WHISTLE]

Okay, kick-outs, boys!

Floor! Kick!

Return! Up!

AJ:
I'm dizzier than shit!

Kick! Return! Up!

Fuck, here he comes.

Whoa, floor, kick, turn, up!

What's going on here?

Come on, stand up, on your feet,
let's go.

Whoa.

- Man!
- I don't feel so good.

I don't want any excuses.

Mr. Meskimmin, I gotta go
to the bathroom.

Is that alcohol on your breath?

[VOMITS]

Hey, how's the boy?

How am I? I got dust up the crack
of my ass, and I'm starving to death.

You're doing an excellent job.
Take pleasure in that.

He's been ragging in my ear all day.
I'd like to kill him. Hear that, prick?

Get him out of here.
Just get him the hell out of here.

- Is there a problem?
- You made your point.

- I made my point.
- You made your point.

- What point?
- Enough with work stoppage.

This union safety official stays until
he deems this place is free of hazard.

- I have the money.
- You do?

Christopher, see if he's paid up
his union dues...

...then pop a wheel cover
to check the brakes.

I'll get right on it.

I'll get your money, okay?

We shall return.

Halle-fucking-lujah!

Give me your cell.
I gotta call Carmela.

You sure it was them?

They were drunk in gym class. Byron
Barber vomited all over the teacher.

I spat it out.

Anthony.

You're gonna lie to me now?

He's sorry, Father Hagy.
He'll be sorrier when he gets home.

Anthony, why don't you wait outside?

He's suspended for three days.

Let me pay for the wine.

This isn't just
a crime against property...

...it's an affront
to our holy sacristy.

I've asked Dr. Galani,
our school psychologist, to join us.

He's been keeping an eye on Anthony.
Meeting with his teachers.

Why don't you pick it up
from there, doctor?

Um, hi.

In many respects, Anthony is
a normal, healthy 8th-grader.

Sister Patricia, his art teacher...

...thinks he shows strong skills
in spatial orientation.

But the thing is, and it's not
just this one incident...

...Anthony sometimes has trouble
following the rules...

...weighing consequences.

At times, doesn't think
before he acts.

And...

...it's thought that there's a good
possibility Anthony could be ADD.

ADD?

- Attention deficit disorder.
- I knew it.

- I knew there was something.
- What is it?

It's an aggregate of symptoms.

Inattention, impulsivity...

...sometimes, although not always,
hyperactivity.

To be sure, we'll give him
a thorough evaluation.

He needs a whack upside the head.

If he's got an illness?
It's an illness, right?

You'd hit somebody who's sick?
You'd hit somebody with polio?

You hit Anthony?

Nobody gets hit in our house.
Not exactly my idea.

What's happening if you can't
do a little tarantella on the kids...

...when they step out of line?

So what happens now?

He'll be given a complete battery
of testing.

Psychological, behavioral, medical.

Let me ask you a question.

These other kids,
you keeping an eye on them?

Are you testing them?
The ones that aren't named Soprano?

There's no immediate plans for that.

We attend to every child at Verbum Dei
according to his own circumstances.

And so what do we,
as the parents, do?

Nothing?

Oh, no, I mean, Anthony's misbehaved.
He should be consequenced.

It's a crime!

To suspend that child from school
with all the money you give them?

That gym teacher shit a brick when your
friend puked on his boots, huh, Anthony?

Want to encourage him?

Whatever happened
to "boys will be boys"?

He stole from the church.
They don't make them any lower.

- What a loser.
- That's enough out of you.

Oh, his father was the same way.

I practically lived
in that vice principal's office.

Could we not, please?

You only remember
what you want to remember.

Yeah, well, I must've had
another son...

...who stole a car when he was
10 years old.

He could barely see over the wheel.

JUNIOR: He was a hellion.
Him and his little crew...

...they stole lobsters on the boats...

...and sold them for a buck
on Bloomfield Avenue.

Really?

How many times must I say it?
I don't want that talk in front of him.

That is wrong, and I don't condone it!

Yeah. Sure.

- Who are you yelling at?
- What?

You stupe.

- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

What's he doing now? What's going on?

He yells at me...

Anthony, I thought this could wait
till after dinner.

Your father and I have talked.

You are not to play Mario Cart
or go skateboarding for three weeks.

And no TV.

No.

CARMELA:
You won't sit on that Internet.

And every day, you'll ride your bike
to go visit Grandma.

Oh, that'll be nice.

It's not fair!

- Some fucking day, huh?
- I feel like a bomb went off.

You know that stuff the doctor said?
I never saw any of that in Anthony.

You never notice how he picks
at the tongue of his shoe?

Like he can't help himself.

If he even has this thing.

Something's going on.

- Carm?
- Yep?

- Do you think he knows?
- I don't know.

She knows.

- Are you...?
- Really?

- What makes you say that?
- Are you in...?

I don't know. Things she says. She
makes remarks, like this today with him.

- Are you in the Mafia?
- She talk to you about me?

Talk? To me?

Something happen on that college trip?

Happen?

Like what?

I don't know, she seemed peculiar
when she got back.

I think pretty soon we're gonna
have to, you know...

...talk to her about the business.

Yeah. The two of us
should sit down with Meadow.

Talk as a family.

With him, they'll test him
and we'll see what's what.

Right?

Good night.

Good night.

Maybe I don't want to admit
something's wrong with my kid...

...but this sounds like bullshit.

What do you mean?

If he's got a disease, why punish him?
Isn't that bullshit?

ADD is a controversial subject.

Is it a disease, or a way for
psychologists to line their pockets?

Many children can really benefit
by professional intervention.

He got in trouble.

So you don't consider his behavior
out of the norm?

No.

I don't know.

What do I know about it?

What do you mean?

Oh, I gotta spell it out for you?

Do you see his behavior
as a reflection of your own?

Look, like I said, maybe I don't want
to admit there's something wrong...

...but if he's got this thing...

...we'll deal with it.

If he had polio, we'd deal with it.

You pick up the pieces
and you go on from there.

So that's what we're gonna do.

Do you want to say anything else
about this?

Well, last time you were telling me
that you had intimate feelings for me.

But you've not mentioned it.

Intimate feelings?

I think I said I was in love.

How are you doing with it?

I can't turn off my feelings because
you say it's a byproduct of therapy.

I never said to
turn off your feelings.

Well, I already got a girlfriend.

She's Russian, 24.

How old are you?

It's interesting it took you so long
to tell me you had a girlfriend.

How are you doing with it?

I gotta ask you one more question
about my son.

You think I should
go easy on him now...

...or press him harder?

That's difficult to say.

What, you want a raise, maybe,
to figure this out?

CARMELA:
Anthony! Anthony Jr., you get up!

AJ: Why? I don't have to go to school.
I'm suspended.

CARMELA: No lying in bed all day.
We're not running a hotel over here.

Get up, have some breakfast!

AJ:
I don't want any. I'm not hungry.

CARMELA: What you are gonna do today
is get up and go rake.

Then pull all of those leaves
out of the pool filter.

You're gonna do some work around here.

MEADOW:
Mom, where's my gray jacket?

I left it downstairs.
What'd you do with it?

Hello?

[LOUD MUSIC PLAYS]

CARMELA: Anthony, turn off that music!
Your father is sleeping!

AJ: You said I couldn't watch TV
or play Nintendo.

CARMELA: What?
AJ: You said nothing about music!

CARMELA: Turn it off right now!
AJ: Why?

Your father is sleeping,
for chrissake!

MEADOW:
Mom, I can't find it. Where is it?

["WHITE RABBIT"
BY JEFFERSON AIRPLANE PLAYS]

[HONKING]

Hey, Johnny!

Johnny, come on!

Uncle Jun, why are you here so early?

Anthony, where's your dad?
He said he'd be outside.

Want me to go get him?

Did you hear the game last night?
Joey Pepitone, three RBIs.

No kidding.
My mom made me go to bed.

You miss your bus to school...

...you walk through
the colored neighborhood.

YOUNG LIVIA:
Junior! Big fancy car.

We're going to my sister's,
and you promised to...

Nonstop!
Don't you get sick of yourself?

Dad, could you and Uncle Jun give me
a ride to school?

Not now, Tony.
You be good, though.

Pay attention to what
those teachers tell you.

Okay.

- See you, Ma.
- Okay. Be good.

[HONKING]

YOUNG TONY:
Hey, wait up!

Shit!

YOUNG JUNIOR:
Hey, Rocco!

ROCCO: Come on, move, move, guys!
Move, move!

Hey, John, one more day, man!
One more day.

ROCCO: There's gonna be a huge payoff.
JOHNNY: I'm gonna kill you!

JOHNNY:
What do you got?

What the fuck is this?
What the fuck are you bringing me here?

Who are you fucking with, Rocco?

- Fuck you!
- Motherfucker!

You asshole!

What are you bringing to me here?

JOHNNY:
Piece of shit!

What the fucking...?

Christ!

You're up.

Who the fuck can sleep
with all this shit going on?

I thought about Jefferson Airplane
this morning. How about that?

1967.

- Made me think of my father.
- What about him?

First time I saw him
whack the shit out of somebody.

What made you think about that?

Something to do with my son, I think,
what's been going on.

Why did your father
whack the shit out of some guy?

I never saw him do something
like that.

He used to whack us kids around
a little.

Really?

Yeah, the belt was his favorite
child development tool.

This was different.

You could tell he knew
what he was doing.

How did you feel about
your father after that?

I didn't want him to do it to me.

Seriously.

What should I say?
I was glad he wasn't a fag.

- How did you and your father get along?
- Good.

He was a good guy, my father.
Everybody liked him.

He knew how to have a good time.

He loved shellfish, clams, oysters.

Taught us how to eat them. You put
Worcestershire on, suck them down.

It's good.

My mother never ate anything raw.

But he wasn't around much.

What did he do for a living?

Retail meat and provisions.

And a little numbers,
extortion, loan-sharking.

How did you feel about that?

- How did I feel?
- About your father...

...being engaged
in illegal activities?

You know,
I never really knew about it.

When did you find out?

Who remembers?

You thought of that incident
this morning.

Are you concerned that your son is
going to find out about you?

Don't talk to me about
legitimate business.

What about chemical companies?

Dumping that shit into rivers and they
got deformed babies popping up all over.

Does he know anything?

I don't know.

Has he asked you?

No.

- How will you handle that?
- I don't know.

Did you ever talk to
your father about it?

Are you kidding?

[DANCE MUSIC PLAYS]

No kidding, Tony.
That doesn't sound like Anthony.

Yesterday, he's a boy.
Today, I worry about him.

Teenagers.

My daughter gives me
feminist shit about this place.

How it "objectifies women."
Shit like that.

These girls pull down 1500 a week.

This bears no weight
with the principessa.

Meadow was one thing,
but this is my son.

Boys are different from girls.

Pussy, Kevin and Matt, they ever ask
you about this thing of ours?

I lied through my teeth,
but they knew. Fucking nitwits.

They love me anyway.

It's hard to raise kids
in an information age.

You know, to protect them.

Hey, what's up?

CHRIS: Who's got an anniversary
or a special occasion?

What are these, antiques?

I was picking up the Chinaman's vig,
and the FedEx van was wide open.

The guy went in for a burger.

No shit, FedEx. They're usually
pretty careful with those.

You did this in daylight?

Nobody saw me.

That's interstate commerce.

You want to be in prison
for a stunt like that, be my guest.

I'd take a licking
but keep on ticking.

I'm getting out of here.

Jesus Christ!

What's with his ass?

He's got a lot on his mind.

What do you think is going on
in this one, Anthony?

I don't know.
How many more are left?

The quicker you answer,
the faster we'll be done.

Whatever pops in your mind.

There's no guy?

Okay, good.
Where do you think he is?

Out buying food for the horse?

Anything else?

Watching TV, maybe?

Maybe he's watching South Park.
Number one's on tonight.

Aliens abduct Cartman and give him an
anal probe and it makes him fart fire.

You're home.

You know, if it's bad, the ADD,
they put Anthony in special ed.

The doctors say that?

Doctors don't know anything yet.
They started testing today.

I picked up these books at the mall.

Help Me To Help My Child?

Listen to this.

"About 50% of children
diagnosed with ADD...

...receive help from
special education teachers."

We don't even know
that's what he's got.

You're right. Let's just be ignorant.
Why worry about anything now?

You blame me, don't you?

Who said anything about that?

No, go ahead. You blame me.

I blame myself.

- For what?
- For what.

For staying with me?

I have two eyes.

Who do we blame our daughter on?

Straight-A student, National Honor
Society, featured soloist in the choir.

Yeah, this isn't going anywhere.

"Like father, like son," right?
What about "Daddy's little girl"?

My son's got your Uncle Lenny in his
gene pool. Do I blame you for that?

If it helps you.

Hi, Grandma.

Well, look who's here.

- Oh, look at that little face.
- Ow.

Pearl, meet my grandson.

This is your grandson?

He rode his bike all the way over
to visit his grandma.

How do you like that?

How come he's not in school?

- Because he was a bad boy!
- Ow.

Yes, he was, that's why.

He's a big one!

She had a stroke.

Now half her brain is gone.

So what shall we do?
What shall we do?

Let's see.

Let's play Scrabble.

You'd be surprised how good
your grandmother is.

I don't think so, Gram.
I'm kind of wiped.

Oh, you're a 13-year-old boy.
You're too young to be so tired.

They sent me to a psychiatrist
all morning. I took a million tests.

A psychiatrist?

You know, because I got
suspended and everything.

They sent you to a psychiatrist?

Yeah.

But that's crazy.
That's all nonsense.

That's nothing but a racket
for the Jews!

Dad goes.

- He does not.
- Yes, he does.

- He does not.
- Yes, he does.

To a psychiatrist?

Yeah.

He does not.

He does too.

Why do you say that?
That's ridiculous!

I heard him and Mom talking about it.

What does he need a psychiatrist for?

Is it okay if I take
that pear, Grandma?

He goes to talk about his mother.
That's what he's doing.

He talks about me, he complains.

"She didn't do this, she did that."

Oh, I gave my life to my children
on a silver platter.

And this is how he repays me.

AJ: Dad, what's that noise?
TONY: Noise?

TONY:
It's a flat tire.

I asked you to clean the nails
from the driveway.

I was praying for something like this.

I spent too much money on braces
for two years...

...not to take you to the dentist now.

Maybe we should call the Auto Club.

We change tires at our house.
Watch and learn.

Yesterday, with the psychologist,
how'd that go?

Okay.

Yeah? What'd you guys do?

He made me look at pictures. And then
I had to say something about them.

Did you talk about
anything interesting?

That's kind of between
me and my therapist.

He said I don't have to
say anything if I didn't want to.

That's what we pay extra for
at that school?

The other night at dinner,
you made a remark.

- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

I'm not mad. I just need to know
what you meant by it.

I didn't mean anything.

Come on.

Kids at school said some stuff.

What'd they say?

That you were in the Mafia.

What do you think?

I don't know.

The guys at
Uncle Jackie's funeral.

And those other guys writing
license plates and taking pictures.

Those were feds, right?
Like in Godfather I.

Uncle Jackie's funeral. Right.

I found this page with Uncle Jackie
on the Web.

It said he ran some union that ripped
off these pension things or something.

Uncle Jackie was a complicated man.

But you loved him, right?

Yeah.

You didn't see me on the Web, did you?

No.

That's right.

Give me a hand so we can
get the algae scraped off your teeth.

I'm going crazy with this shit,
what he knows, what he doesn't know.

He'll find out eventually.
What's the difference?

Me, my father. It's probably
in the genes, right?

You know, this ADD thing.

It's probably genetical.

What about Pussy?

He's an acquaintance of mine.

This guy is a stone gangster,
and he's got three kids.

One graduated,
and two are going to Villanova.

- How do you account for that?
- Then you got Leopold and Loeb.

They murdered this kid for fun...

...and their father was
a successful businessman.

Do you hold your father responsible
for what you've become?

Sometimes I think about
what life would've been like...

...if my father hadn't gotten mixed up
in what he got mixed up in.

How life would've been different.

Maybe I'd be selling patio furniture
in San Diego.

We talked last time about
how you felt when you became aware...

...of your father's criminal life.
Any more thoughts on that?

When you first started therapy,
you said you had this dream...

...about those ducks.

They flew away with your penis.
It was a bad omen...

...that something was going to happen
in your family.

Is this the terrible thing?

Look, if you know something, please,
quit fucking around.

I think it's important to remember.

You said you liked
the History Channel.

He who doesn't understand history
is doomed to repeat it.

- Let's talk about your father.
- My father.

Heads up!

Why are you smiling?

Just thinking about my uncle.

He used to throw the ball with me.

The one with whom you have
all the static?

Yeah.

Uncle Jun.

He was always practicing his curve ball
outside in front of the house.

I was probably about 8 or 9.

Then my sister came out.

The one who lives in California?

Janice.

How does she feel about your parents?

Who cares what she thinks?
She calls herself Vishnamantha.

Soprano isn't good enough for her.
Wannabe dot-head.

Why were you thinking of your uncle?

I don't know.

What are you doing?

I'm getting in the car.

Why? Where are you going?

Someplace.

Where are you going?
Can I come?

Your mom wants you to get
the screens down to the basement.

No, I want to go with you guys.

He said no.

Janice...

...you both won't be going,
you talk to your brother like that.

Go on.

My mother was inside, cooking the meat
for the gravy, you know, the "red lead."

Pork bones and veal.
It was a Sunday.

- But you said...
- I said we'd see.

What's the matter with her?
She won't eat.

You won't have to get me anything
for Christmas.

You won't have to tell me
to take the trash out.

I shouldn't have to tell you
to take the trash out.

Why can't I have this?
It isn't fair!

I don't want to hear about
that stupid electric organ!

It's not stupid, it's fun.

Enough! He won't give me
a moment's peace.

If Janice wanted it, she'd get it.
She always gets what she wants.

Where were they going?
Why couldn't I go?

Your sister does as she's told.

Right, I forgot.

Janice never does anything wrong.
She's just perfect.

You're driving me crazy!

No, I'm not.

She said what?

She was high-strung,
very dramatic.

Every night to her is
a night at the opera.

I could stick this fork in your eye!

She wasn't gonna do it.

Holy shit, that's why
I'm remembering all this.

- On account of where they were going.
- Where were they going?

I found out a couple Sundays later.

NEWSCASTER: The toll now stands
at 11 dead and 600 wounded...

...as well as
hundreds of businesses...

Mom, I'm going to
the CYO to play ball.

Take a bat with you, what they're
doing on Springfield Avenue.

Looting and sniper fire
along Springfield Avenue continue...

...with Mayor Hugh Addonizio placing
blame on outside agitators...

Come on, Dad, let's go!

I'm coming, I'm coming.

Keep your sticky fingers off the car.
I just waxed the damn thing.

Can I steer?

Maybe on the way home, honey.

Here we are.

Come on.

Uncle Jun?

Buy something nice.

My heart was broken.

You felt your father was
showing favoritism.

I still remember that feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

Did you confront them?

Have you been listening to me?
Kids don't confront in my family.

How does this pertain to
the situation with your son?

This amusement park is where I found
out my father wasn't like other fathers.

I took the bus this time.

It was three transfers from Newark.

I had this candy bar in my pocket.

It had sand or lint
or something on it.

What you doing?
Where you spitting?

I ain't doing nothing!

You threw that wrapper on the floor.

- Pick it up!
- Leave me alone!

Come back! Pick it up!

WOMAN:
What in the world?

COP:
Stop or I'll shoot!

You're under arrest!

Stop!

[GUNSHOT]

[SCREAMING]

You're under arrest.

My leg!

TONY: Name was Cicchi Sasso, my
father's cousin on his mother's side.

Got out of Vietnam on account
of cops blew his kneecap off.

What's the matter with you cops?

Can't bring your kid to
an amusement park no more?

Daddy! Daddy!

It's okay, baby. It's okay.

You go home to Mommy, sweetheart.

Va fangool, why don't you go
lock up the melanzane?

They're burning down Newark.

JOHNNY: I want my lawyer.
I'm not saying shit to you.

MAN:
That's Johnny-boy Soprano!

[SIRENS]

JOHNNY:
Asshole, you're hurting my wrist.

Get the fuck in there, Clarabell.

He used Janice as a front.
They brought their daughters...

...so that their business
looked sweet and innocent.

That must've been devastating.

It turned out it was no big deal.

To see your father handcuffed
and led away by the police?

Well, at the time I thought
my head was gonna explode.

He looked helpless.

But when I got home, my mother
had a different perspective.

Which made me feel better.

So in her pain,
she reached out to you.

That's one way to put it.

Your father may not be home
for dinner. Go wash up.

- I know.
- What do you know?

I saw him getting arrested.
What did he do?

He didn't do anything!
They just pick on Italians.

Still, in my heart, I knew
my father was no freedom fighter.

So he went to jail?

He came home in a couple hours.

TONY:
We were watching Ed Sullivan.

[THE YOUNG RASCALS'
"I'VE BEEN LONELY TOO LONG" PLAYS]

[DOOR OPENS]

Hey! Livia!

Look who's home.

- What happened?
- What happened?

I got you cherry vanilla
at Nasto's.

That didn't take long.
Must be in good with the uppity-ups.

Let this be a lesson.

Those stupid cops,
they went to the wrong place.

Arrested the wrong guys.

How's my little girl?
You all right?

- I'm okay.
- Good.

ROCCO:
Johnny-boy! Hey, Johnny-boy!

Good for you, Johnny.

Show those fucking sons of bitches.

JOHNNY:
What's up, Rocco?

So...

...everything okay?

I don't understand.
The man your father beat up...

...was the same one
congratulating him?

Yeah. One of them.

Rocco Allatore.

Why'd they arrest him?

He was in violation of his parole.

Association with known undesirables.

But nothing ever happened.
It just went away.

He'd been in prison?

He was away when I was a kid...

...but they told me he was
in Montana being a cowboy.

What?

My son is doomed, right?

Why do you say that?

This is the part where
I'm supposed to tell you...

...how terrible my father was
and the terrible things he did...

...and how he ruined my life.

But I'll tell you, I was proud
to be Johnny Soprano's kid.

When he beat the shit
out of that guy...

...I told the class
how tough my father was.

Is that how your son feels about you?

Yeah, probably.

And I'm glad.
I'm glad if he's proud of me.

But that's the bind I'm in.
I don't want him to be like me.

He could be anything he wants.

He could be like a guy
I knew in school.

His grandfather invented
ties for the end of salamis.

He made millions of dollars.
He's sitting on his ass.

Have you communicated this
to your son?

Not in so many words.

Probably not at all.

What's the difference?
You said it.

It's in the blood. It's hereditary.

Genetic predispositions are only that.
Predispositions.

It's not a destiny written in stone.
People have choices.

She finally offers an opinion.

Well, they do. You think everything
that happens is preordained?

You don't think that human beings
possess free will?

How come I'm not making
fucking pots in Peru?

You're born to this shit.
You are what you are.

Within that there's
a range of choices.

This is America.

Right. America.

JOHNNY:
So, Livia, what do you think, huh?

LIVIA: Okies and misfits,
that's who goes there.

Losers, the Beverly Hillbillies.

So now Rocco Allatore's a loser?

I've had to rough Rocco up because of
money, but he's got a fucking brain.

He's opening a new book.

After that gets up,
we get a little cash flow...

Oh, Mr. Cash Flow!
Big businessman now.

What do you know?
You're scared of your own shadow.

Reno is growing by
leaps and bounds, Livia.

It's a chance to get in
on the ground floor.

After Rocco gets the book up,
he'll open a supper club.

- He wants me to run it.
- A supper club? Are you drunk?

Jesus Christ Almighty!

Fucking albacore around my neck!

Every time I try...
Me and the kids'll go without you!

They are not going anywhere!

I'd rather smother them with a pillow
than take them to Nevada!

JOHNNY:
Always with the drama!

Livia, here you are.

Junior, you scared me to death.

I can't stay, but I didn't want
to let another day go by.

Business headaches
like you won't believe.

Oh, yeah, you and the other one.
With all your headaches.

Who, Tony?

Don't be so hard on him.

He's got a lot to learn, but he's
headed in the right direction.

Where to?
Overbrook State Mental Hospital?

What?

Hey, Uncle Jun. How you doing?

He's keeping his hair.

You see, what a good boy,
he comes to visit his mother.

My son's staying for dinner, Junior.
I don't suppose you have time.

You two want to visit each other.

Junior's very busy these days
with his headaches.

Not too busy to shoot the shit
with you, Tony.

We gotta catch a ball game.

Hey, you got my number. All right.

That man.

He's so full of himself
since becoming caporegime.

He makes me sick.

Remember the Allatores, Ma?

Oh, why wouldn't I?

They moved to Nevada.
They're billionaires now.

Oh, that Rocco Allatore,
he was a real go-getter.

- Didn't Dad want to go with him?
- Your father? No.

Yeah, he did.
I remember you guys talking about it.

Allatore would start a business,
Dad would do it with him.

Rocco just got him all worked up,
that's all.

What is this with all
these questions?

Dad wanted to go with him.

You wouldn't let him.

Let him?

What do you mean?

You just tell me one time
your father didn't do...

...exactly as he wanted.

I don't know. Maybe this was
his chance to get out.

Dad was no choirboy, but maybe
with a little bit of support...

Mr. Sensitive now.

Well, if it bothers you, maybe
you better talk to a psychiatrist.

What are you talking about,
a psychiatrist?

That's what people do when they want
somebody to blame for their life.

You're a real stone player,
aren't you?

You threatened to smother
his children.

What does that mean?

Everybody thought Dad was ruthless,
but I gotta hand it to you.

If you'd been born
after those feminists...

...you would've been
the real gangster.

I don't know what
you're talking about!

Please, sit.

I know you're probably eager to hear
the results of our testing.

- How's Anthony doing?
- Good, I think. Don't you think so?

Yeah, I think so.

Okay.

Well, good.

Let's get to it.

The good news is, no evidence
of learning disability.

Cognitive function, verbal
and nonverbal intelligent testing...

...arithmetic and reading
evaluation...

- ...all within normal range.
- Thank goodness.

Got a clean bill of health.

No soft sign on
the neurological, either.

That's all the good news.
Why don't you tell us the bad news?

Well, as to whether
Anthony has ADD...

...the results were interesting.

The APA Standard is for the subject
to manifest six out of nine...

...possible symptoms of ADD.

In testing, Anthony manifested
five of those symptoms.

Five, really?

He often has difficulty
awaiting his turn...

...is often quote-unquote "on the go,"
or acts as if driven by a motor...

...often interrupts or intrudes
on others...

...and often fidgets
with hands or feet.

He fidgets with hands or feet?

That's right.

You mean, like, he fidgets.

Uh-huh.

And that's a sickness, to fidget?

Mr. Soprano, it's one of nine
possible symptoms.

What constitutes a fidget?

Tony...

No, no, what constitutes a fidget?

So what if he fidgets?
Who doesn't fidget in school?

The kid's in puberty.
He gets a hard-on every 10 minutes.

Anthony is a borderline case.

He's not a case,
he's a 13-year-old boy.

Every time you see a problem,
you turn it into a disease.

He's a kid who made a mistake,
and he'll pay for it.

But he's gonna be fine. Come on.

I think he's right.

And I don't think we should have to
pay for this testing.

NARRATOR ON TV: To oppose this
massive force bearing down on Midway...

...Admiral Nimitz had no battleships
in shape for the fight.

However, he had the carriers...

...Yorktown, Enterprise and Hornet.

This might prove to be the trump card.

Studying?

Government.

It's not the end of the world, Anth.

I'm depressed.

You're not depressed.

You're sad because you did
something stupid, and you got grounded.

You can't watch TV or play on your
computer for a couple weeks.

It's gonna stay like that.

It isn't fair.

You got that right.

What are you doing?

What's it look like?

Can I have one too?

This one's yours.

Gonna need sprinkles.

Okay.

You want nuts?

Yeah. M&M's?

["WHITE RABBIT"
BY JEFFERSON AIRPLANE PLAYS]

Pretty good.
JUNIOR:
We know what we're gonna do.

Till the government indicts, anyway.

Jimmy! This answers your concerns?

I think a lot of good ground
was covered.

JUNIOR:
Okay, I guess that's it.

- You gotta get the tickets.
- I got them already.

JIMMY: Fuck! The Rangers
are gonna lose anyway.

You're right, it's him.

He asks for a meeting to discuss
shit we covered. He's wearing a wire.

You got my okay.

Send a message to everybody else.

All right.

See you later.

[ELEVATOR BELL RINGS]

Who told me you hated
the fucking Russians?

The pricks Junior brought to pound
my ass were Russian. I was bitter.

Tony's goomar is Russian,
you couldn't ask for a nicer person.

- These two are friends of hers.
- I got enough cologne on?

Smells like Paco Rabanne
crawled up your ass and died.

Easy for you to say.
I don't get young ones.

You'll be glad I got you out of bed.

Russian boo-boos, you go for some
foreplay, they'll detail your car.

- How's the hygiene over there?
- I don't know. This is here.

You didn't let me
put anything decent on.

Here we are.

Baby, how are you?

- Is Tatiana here?
- I'll go get her.

- You are Jimmy?
- Yeah, that's right, I'm Jimmy.

JIMMY:
My man!

Big tits, little feet.
A hit in any man's league.

Have a seat.

Punk-ass pieces of shit!
You forget I'm a captain?

Why don't you call for help
on your radio mic, you rat!

- Mother of God!
SILVIO: What's wrong?

Not wearing one tonight?

No time to put on anything decent.

God!

[SILENCED GUNSHOT]

Get the piano dolly.

MEADOW:
Come on, stop, I want to watch.

Kiss me!

Oh, Georgia O'Keefe.

[NOISE]

Was that your back gate?

It's probably nothing, come here.

People always say that
in these movies.

Last thing I need is your dad
comes home, sees my Dominican ass.

LIVIA: Settimia!
- Jesus fuck!

I just saw my grandmother. How'd she
get here from her nursing home?

[BED CREAKS]

LIVIA:
Settimia!

Cakey!

Tell my sister to open the door!

Grandma, it's me! Anthony, Jr.

You've got whooping cough!
Get yourself under the vaporizer!

Holy shit.

JEREMY:
What do you want?

LIVIA:
Go away!

I will never speak...

...another word to you
again, Settimia.

Aunt Settimia's dead.
It's me, Meadow.

Facia bruta!

Grandma, it's Meadow, remember?
Come sit down.

LIVIA:
Yes. Meadow.

Oh, I can't stay in this house,
honey bunch.

Not while that facia bruta's
in here.

[DOORBELL]

Come on, let's go see who it is.

Evening. How are we?

Make my sister get out of the house.

It's 1 a.m. Why were you walking
on Mountain Avenue at this hour?

Shut up.

We got a complaint
from your neighbors.

She's my grandmother.

Hi, Grandma.

- Hi!
- Ah, shit!

OFFICER: You know this young man?
- Of course, he's...

He's my grandson.

And is this your house, dear?

MELFI:
Where was she trying to get to?

Schrafts.

She's being retested.

For Alzheimer's.

It's been a long odyssey
with your mother.

Oh, these last 500 years
just seemed to race by.

Listen to me.

It's okay.

Let it out.

They're transferring her
to the nursing unit.

Which is the thing that
she dreaded and feared.

Isn't it interesting how this
memory loss has cropped up...

...right after you failed to be
killed in the carjacking?

You think it was a carjacking?

Of course not.

But I got an idea
who was behind it, and...

Enough said.

You don't want to go there.

- Maybe you don't want to go there.
- What?

Well, let's track it.

Around the time of the shooting,
you were having hallucinations...

...of that Isabella figure.

The protective, loving mother.

Your subconscious was shouting
something at you.

The day before the shooting...

...you said that she kept going on
about news stories...

...of mothers throwing their babies
out of windows.

Why don't we put our cards
on the table!

You think my mother tried to have me
whacked for putting her in a home?

In your worst dreams,
a duck flies off with your penis!

- Castration.
- My mother never went after my basket.

No, not literally.

Look, ordinarily a patient is helped
to make his own breakthroughs.

But your life is in danger, so I'm
willing to put the cards on the table.

I say what your mother has,
at the very least...

...is "borderline
personality disorder."

Borderline personality disorder?

Let me read to you from
the DSM form, okay?

Definitions of the condition.

"A pattern of unstable
relationships.

Affective instability."

It means intense anxiety,
a joylessness.

Their internal phobias are
the only things that exist.

The real world, real people
are peripheral.

These people have no love
or compassion.

Borderline personalities are very good
at splitting behavior...

...creating bitterness and conflict...

...between others in their circle.

You twisted fucking bitch!

That's my mother, not some fuck
in Attica, stab you in the shower!

Relax.

We're through, you and I.
We're finished.

You're lucky I don't
break your face in 50,000 pieces!

Okay.

Jackie's work killed him. All
that agita brought on the disease.

His reign was peaceful.
This shooting with Tony...

Suppose Jackie hadn't died of cancer.

Who knows how his life
would've ended?

Look at Angie Bompensiero. A fucking
shell since Pussy disappeared.

Ladies! Compliments of the house.
Buccating 'matriciana.

You want a pair of hippos
to walk out of here?

That's imported pancetta!

Will you hate me if I say I like it
here better than the old Vesuvio?

A few bugs to be ironed out.

The one in your salad
was a freak occurrence.

My produce man, he's the most
expensive in the area.

Insurance really came through!

Yes, it did.

Carm, what'd I hear about Tony's mom?

It looks like Alzheimer's.

- Oh, boy!
CARMELA: Yeah.

I've known Mrs. S since...

She's always been an individualist,
should we say?

But she's a real pistol,
what a character!

- Poor Tony.
- Yeah, he's beside himself.

He's got a lot on his plate.

The attempted carjacking...

CARMELA:
Hey, well...

I'll let you eat.

- Enjoy!
ROSALIE: Thanks, Artie.

Oh, my God, look who's here!

What? You hiding back here?
Your best friend's on table 12.

When are you gonna bury the hatchet?

Arthur, I love Carmela like a sister.

We just don't want this place
to become another mob hangout.

A certain amount of that kind
of patronage creates buzz.

Artie, that kind of buzz
we should avoid in droves.

Shit!

[STOMPS BUG]

First time here?

Gift from the Dellacrocces.

Artie's opening promotion.

- You will not believe the food!
- That's what I hear.

They'd have to be doing
something special...

...to trump you two ladies
at the spice rack.

I was over at Carmela's
the other night, Ro.

We had some zabaglion' that,
of course, we did make it together...

...but everybody was raving about it!

Please, you made it, basically.

I wish Tony had taken me up
on my offer to talk to him...

...about the carjacking that day.

That makes two of us.

Yeah.

Well, I'd better get seated and order.

Why don't you stay here,
take a load off!

How's the watch, Father Phil?

Oh, it's fantastic.

I can set one of the dials
to the millennial countdown.

- I haven't done it yet.
- Is that Jackie's watch?

Yeah, it is.

Thanks again, Ro.

[ROSALIE CRIES]

[BAR PATRONS LAUGH AND YELL]

[BOTTLES CRASH]

Mr. Soprano was kind enough
to come with us.

TONY: You threatened to wait
till my kids got home.

Agent Harris explained that there's
something we'd like you to hear.

The Springsteen box set.
I already got it!

CUBITOSO: You know Agent Grasso.
- Yeah, how you doing?

Have a seat.

As we both know,
there's been an attempt on your life.

You have enemies.

It's a safe assumption that you may
have run out your string in Jersey.

The lovely Agent Harris and I have had
this conversation. I'll pass.

CUBITOSO:
You haven't heard the tape.

Play it.
I don't give a fuck what's on it!

I understand you and Agent Grasso had
a colloquy about our shared heritage.

Colla-who?

You and I are not compare.

You on the one hand,
me and Agent Grasso on the other.

Even though our ancestors all hail
from the same sunny peninsula.

What the fuck is your problem?

But we do share some cultural ideas:

Religious, culinary...

...matriarchal.

Maybe we can motivate you to testify.

Get the kumquats out of your mouth
and get to the point.

JUNIOR: Boy, Anthony must've really
gotten under your collar. Admit it.

You're looking to crack his coglioni
for putting you in here.

LIVIA: I don't know what
you're talking about.

JUNIOR: Yeah, and I'm playing
shortstop for the Mets.

LIVIA: A psychiatrist.
He's been seeing one for a while now.

God only knows what he says.

You wired Green Grove.

It was my idea. Everyone else
thought it was a waste of money.

LIVIA: My cousin Cakey, after his
lobotomy, looked exactly like my son.

Empty, a shell. Better Cakey had died
than go on living like that.

That's what his own mother
always used to say.

[CUBITOSO TURNS OFF RECORDER]

JUNIOR: What are you talking about,
meetings? Who, Livia?

LIVIA:
All of them! Raymond. Larry.

JUNIOR: Three of my capos
have their mothers here?

If this is true, Livia, I mean,
I'm the boss, for Christ's sake!

If I don't act, blood or no...

I have to!

[TURNS RECORDER OFF]

[KNOCKS ON DOOR]

ARTIE:
Mrs. S!

How are you?

You remember me?

- Arthur Bucco?
- That's right!

Victoria's boy!

That's right.

Yeah, you and my Johnny
used to play Little League together.

No! Johnny was your husband.

But you're right about the Little
League, that was me and Tony!

My son. That's right. Yeah.

Oh, gee, what's the matter with me?

How are you?

Well, how are you, Arthur?

Never been better.

It's a nice room.

Lots of sun!

Sit down.

How's your mother?
You call her every day?

Mom passed away.

Really?

When?

About six months ago.

Please, give her my regards.

Is she still on that crazy diet?

I brought you something.

From my restaurant.
I don't know if you remember Vesuvio?

Oh, of course I do!

Way back when your dad had it!

Good for you!

Yeah, I got a new restaurant.

Here you go.

- Gavadel!
- With a nice duck ragu.

Homemade. It's northern.

Oh, northern.

Mrs. S, what's the matter?

Something I said?

You're a good boy, Arthur.
Coming to visit me.

We go back a ways.
You made a mean PB & J.

After what my son did to you.

Oh, how can I look you in the face?

Tony?

What did he do now?

You don't blame him
for setting the fire?

Well, you're a bigger man than some.

Well, we should all be grateful...

...that nobody
was incinerated to death.

Altieri's wake is tonight.

CHRIS:
I phoned in a bomb scare.

See, now that's over the top.

Junior and Mikey took out the hit.
Start things moving.

Not like we didn't know.

- How did you find out for sure?
- No room for interpretation.

Minchia.

- I'm sorry.
- Your own uncle.

TONY:
Well, let's do it right.

Act normal, plan things out.
Make no mistakes.

If I'm your uncle,
I gotta finish what I started.

He could strike first.

And he won't use Boyz II Men
this time, he'll go with who he knows.

Chucky Signore. No, Mikey's now
too high up.

Chucky's gotta disappear
without setting off alarms.

I just passed my Coast Guard test.

T, anything else?

My ear hurts.

Here, one of mine.

It'll help you sleep.

What kind of person can I be,
where his own mother wants him dead?

The problem is not with you.

That woman is a peculiar duck.
She always has been.

That's not the point.

And she's gotten worse with age.

You think my mother didn't warn me?

Don't start with that again.

Your sisters left so young, you'd
think there were contracts on them.

I know.

But you were different.

You tried to make it work.

Two pricks with nine millimeters.

My self-esteem is non-existent
right now.

I could kill her...

...with these two hands.

The next time I see her...

You'll play the concerned
daughter-in-law, even-keeled.

- For the sake of the business.
- Fuck the business.

And let me tell you,
dollars to doughnuts...

...this Alzheimer's thing is an act,
so she can't be called on her shit.

Uncle Jun and I had our problems
with the business...

...but I never should've razzed him
about eating pussy.

This whole war could've been averted.

Cunnilingus and psychiatry
brought us to this.

You had to see a shrink
because of the mother you had.

When I look at the guys now,
all I feel is humiliation.

I'll take care of my uncle...

...and I'll take care of Mikey P,
and I'll get some satisfaction.

But inside...

...I'll know.

TONY: Relax!
- What are you doing here?

Putting the Stugots
in the marina next door.

Look at this baby I caught
off the point here.

Just wait a minute!

Oh, no! No!

- Look, I need to talk to you!
- No!

TONY:
Come on!

I'm dialing 911...

...because you've given me no choice.

TONY:
Come on!

If anything happens,
they're gonna hear everything!

We'll go down to a coffee shop,
there's plenty of people around!

OPERATOR:
Emergency services. May I help you?

TONY:
Let me talk to you!

Do I have your word that I'm
in no physical danger?

I'm humbled that you
would take my word, yes.

What?!

Yes, you got my word!

OPERATOR: Emergency services, state
the nature of your emergency. Hello?

Oh, God!

MELFI: I take no pleasure in the fact
that I was right about your mother.

Have any dreams since you heard
the FBI tapes?

No.

Some sex dreams.

- Involving?
- My neighbor.

Jean Cusamano.

Go on.

We're doing it doggie style...

You know Jean.

That's okay, go on.

I'm doing her doggie style...

...and I finish, you know,
and her big ass is...

We don't got time for this shit!

It's interesting that you would
say a big ass...

...because Jean is quite slender.

We got bigger things to talk about
than Jean's ass.

Feelings of worthlessness sparked by
your mother's plot to have you killed?

One of the reasons they
tried to have me clipped...

...is because I'm seeing a shrink.

- You.
- Oh.

Oh.

You know that our conversation
is privileged...

...and I couldn't testify
against anybody.

Well, maybe they know that.
And maybe they don't.

Either way, they're using it
as an excuse.

You never mentioned
any of your associates by name.

Except for that one fellow, Booty?

Pussy, Pussy!

Pussy, Booty,
I don't know his last name!

And anything concerning
your Uncle Junior...

Shut the fuck up a minute!

- You're in danger.
- Get out of here! That's not fair!

Oogots, fair.
They don't give a shit about fair.

What am I supposed to do?

Leave town. Today. Right now.

I'm gonna get some guys here
until you get on a plane!

I can't just do that, lam it!

I have a life, I have patients!

Tell them August came early.

It doesn't work that way.
I have patients who are suicidal!

They won't feel any better
if you get clipped!

Jesus fucking Christ!

Look, I know, I'm sorry, okay?

I'm gonna work on this problem
and I'll take care of it...

...and you'll be able to come back.

My God!

People are gonna get murdered.

Don't worry about those distractions,
you keep your eye on the ball.

- I know what you're thinking.
- You have no idea.

The cops aren't gonna help you
because you can't give them anything!

Don't be stupid!
Even in the short term.

Get the fuck out of town.

You've been a good doctor to me.
Thank you.

Artie, how's your rash?

[ARTIE COCKS GUN]

- What are you doing?
- How could you?

How the fuck could you?

You took their money?

Good, then do it.

I don't give a fuck anymore.

That restaurant was like my child.

So they got in your ear.

Three generations of Buccos
sweated over that same stove.

Even your mother treasures
the memory of Vesuvio.

My mother?

Don't say she's lying, Tone.
Because why would she?

What'd she tell you?

Don't make it worse.

Do me the respect of not treating me
like a fucking idiot piece of shit!

When you blew up the restaurant, you
made me part of a criminal conspiracy!

Did you ever think about that?

I don't know what she told you,
my mother, of all people.

Arson investigators gave that fire
a clean bill of health.

Why would I blow up
your restaurant?

To help me!
You fucking bent psycho!

You hear your uncle's gonna hurt my
business by staging a hit...

...and that's your solution?

To burn it down
for the insurance money!

What kind of stupid,
sick, twisted logic?

All right. Ask yourself a question.

Am I that fucking stupid?

Am I that fucking stupid, really?

My mother...

...God bless her,
is going senile, Artie.

You saw her.

I love my new place so much.

And this ruins everything!

I swear to God,
I didn't touch your place, Artie.

My mother was confused.

Look me in the eye.

Tell me you didn't lay a finger
on my place!

I didn't burn down your restaurant.

I swear on my mother.

Take it easy!

What the fuck are you doing?

TONY:
Come on, look out!

TONY: It's good we can get together
for our Sunday dinner.

Or somebody's nose
could get out of joint.

Joint!

CARMELA:
You gotta admit it, Ma.

It's nice that they
let you out for family occasions.

I don't have to admit anything.

- I gotta leave in 10 minutes.
- Meadow!

I have to study with Hunter.

Is this pork cooked?

TONY:
The kids are growing up.

Gonna be out of the house soon.
Even goo-gootz over there.

You believe she'll be studying,
I got a bridge to sell.

LIVIA: You know, I read that last week
in the paper...

...about this family
in Saint Louis Obispo.

In California.

That whole family died of trichinosis.

That's uncooked pork.

That was last year, that same family.

Listen to him. He knows everything.

TONY: Uncle Jun, did you
hear from your lawyer?

Hey, on and on it goes.

Ma, don't you agree they should not
talk business at the table?

What's going on in your world?

Such as?

The state of the union.

So I hear Artie Bucco came to see you.

Who is Artie?

[HUMS]

Anthony.

Friend of mine
from elementary school.

He owns a restaurant.
They had a little fire in it.

Came to see me? Where?

Where are we talking about?
Here?

ARTIE:
I've lost faith in everything.

FATHER PHIL: You moved away
from God quite some time ago though.

Is it fair to say
it's not just this recent crisis?

ARTIE:
Yeah. Back in high school.

Maybe before.

I bring the kids here on holidays,
but my mind wanders.

I just stare at the stained glass.
People's hats.

I'm full of rage, Father.

Murderous, whatever...

Urges.

I don't just hate this man,
I hate all men.

I hate life!

Have you talked with your wife?

I can't.

Why?

Oh, what it would do to her.

She's been through so much.

Charmaine's a strong woman.

She's gonna find out
in the course of the investigation.

I...

I didn't go to the insurance company.

Why not?

Well, legally... What if I'm wrong?
I could be hit with a defamation suit.

Arthur, you know what your heart
is telling you.

The reason you haven't
told Charmaine...

...is because you know she'll insist
you go to the police immediately.

And this'll jeopardize
your restaurant, everything.

But you must be strong.

All due respect, Father,
you're getting off the subject.

CHRIS:
Sorry I'm fucking late.

TONY:
Okay.

I need to tell you something.

And I want you should hear from me,
not from some asshole on the street.

About four or five months ago
I started seeing a psychiatrist.

You know, I was passing out
and they couldn't find nothing.

She's been helping me with that.

Okay, give it to me.
Give it to my face, come on!

Well, I'm sure you did it
with complete discretion.

And speaking for Pussy, if he's
still alive, I'm sure he would agree.

Business was not discussed,
no names were mentioned.

Junior knows.

He's decided to use it against me.

Ask now, because we're not
discussing this again.

It's not the worst thing I ever heard.

I was seeing a therapist myself
about a year ago.

I had some issues. Enough said.

I learned some coping skills.

Look, this thing of ours,
the way it's going...

...be better if we could
admit to each other...

...these are painful, stressful times.

But it'll never fucking happen.

What about you?
You got a problem with this?

What is it?
Like, marriage counseling?

Yeah, like that. Sort of, yeah.

FATHER PHIL: The Contra commandant
was trying to scare us priests.

That's so dangerous down there.

FATHER PHIL:
It's the de cecco.

ROSALIE:
The fresh basil really adds to it.

- Father, you got a little...
- Thanks.

FATHER PHIL: You want a little bit?
- No, please, I have so much at home.

FATHER PHIL:
So how are the twins, Rosalie?

CHARMAINE: You should say, "Would
you like a cocktail or see the wine list?"

ADRIANA: Yeah, sure.
I'll do it however you like.

My other job, the waiters
do the cocktail solicitation...

...but if you want,
I'll do it as I seat them.

- Good. Great, thanks.
- All right.

She catches on fast, that one.
Very conscientious.

She's working two jobs to become
a music manager, whatever that is.

Everything is going so good.

The new exterminators, I got faith.

The owner is Portuguese.
They're sticklers.

I feel so wonderful,
we're up and running again.

Oh, you said you had
something to tell me.

I like the bar stools.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYS]

Good morning, everybody!

MEADOW:
You're in a good mood today, Dad.

And if Chucky calls,
you get me on the cell phone.

Ho! You hear me?

Yeah, okay.
I think that I heard you already.

Go take a Midol.

[COUGHS]

[DOG BARKS]

WOMAN:
Nipps! Nipps! Bad boy!

[GUNSHOT]

[GUNSHOT]

PAULIE:
You prick!

[GUNSHOT]

Motherfucker!

Son of a bitch!
Oh, come on, please!

Please, come on! Come on!

Oh, come on! Oh, please. Please!

Fucking poison ivy all over!

My friend Brendan, you shot him
in his bathtub! No chance to run!

No! I swear to God, it was Junior.
He hated that kid, it was him!

Yeah, right, it was Junior!
Mr. Magoo!

Oh, come on, please, please, please!

I can feel it itching me already!

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

AGENT 1: Corrado Soprano? FBI.
- Fuck!

AGENT 2: Are you Laurence Barese?
- What the fuck?

AGENT 3:
Joseph Sasso, you're under arrest.

FEMALE NEWSCASTER:
Junior Soprano...

...boss of the crime family
that bears his name...

...was indicted today
on federal racketeering charges.

TONY: Talk about timing,
he's lucky he's alive!

FEMALE NEWSCASTER: Along with
Laurence "Larry Boy" Barese...

...ailing alleged underboss,
Joseph "Beppy" Sasso...

...and 13 other reputed mob figures.

Oh, my God! It's Uncle Junior!

Look at the old guy,
making him do the perp walk!

A legitimate businessman!

- Dad, cut the crap.
- Go dry your hair!

These indictments are part
of an ongoing investigation...

...stretching back nearly four years.

They represent the most crippling blow
to Mob activities in New Jersey...

...since the early 1980s.

Uncle Junior got busted!

Cool!

FEMALE NEWSCASTER: Not seized
today, but named in the indictments...

...was alleged Soprano enforcer and
loan sharking chief, Michael Palmice.

Authorities believe Palmice may have
fled, acting on prior knowledge.

Oh, lucky him!

Palmice's wife denied any knowledge
of her husband's whereabouts.

He was so happy, he was going out
to try out his new running shoes.

And he told me that he loved me,
and that he would be right back.

[PHONE RINGS]

TONY: All right, go on,
go eat somewhere else.

Hello? Counselor, thanks for
getting back to me so quick.

TONY: He says the indictment sounds
better for the Feds than it really is.

I wasn't named because the focus...

...is some calling-card scam
that Junior and Larry had...

...and this Diamante technical stock
thing that I wasn't into.

Thank God!

That prick, Altieri,
gave them reams of shit.

They got stuff on all of us,
from the surveillance at Green Grove.

They don't have a case.

An ongoing investigation, the DA said.

They always say that,
to make it sound good.

This is no fucking joke.

I gotta worry about the guys
that got pinched today, if they flip.

ARTIE: So you double-checked all this?
All right, good work.

Art! Hello, how are things?

Good, Father. Busy.

You?

Like the man said,
"Rust never sleeps."

Father, I want to thank you for taking
the time to talk to me the other day.

Did you bring your wife into things?

- No.
- No?

Sitting there in God's house,
I realized...

...you can either be a "yes" person
or a "no" person.

A positive ion, or a negative ion.

I'm not quite sure I get
what you're saying.

It's just that...

...this woman's always been
an odd bird, a sea of negativity.

As a kid, we took her
ravings with a grain of salt.

But you also said
the son was unstable.

I was...

...angry.

Complicated? Yes, he is.

A little too comfortable
outside the law? Yes, he is.

But it would only add to the quotient
of sorrow in the world to doubt him.

When the source is a person
who rarely has a kind word for anyone.

You seem at peace.

I am, Father.

Thank you again, Father.

Sure. Okay, Artie.

CONIGLIARO:
Do you prefer "Corrado" or "Junior."

I prefer "Mr. Soprano."

Your tenure as boss was a short one.

Actually, it was unusual
in several ways.

Let me put this to you simply.

You can avoid these charges
if you will testify that, in fact...

...you were not the boss
of North Jersey, that in fact...

...your nephew Anthony Soprano was,
and is.

That he, de facto, controlled your
capos with the backing of New York...

...communicating through
their emissary, John Sacrimoni.

We want Johnny Sack.

But more than him
we want Mangano and Teresi.

I want to fuck Angie Dickinson,
see who gets lucky first.

We want you
to confirm information we have...

...through informants and wiretap
that you were allowed to profit...

...but you were not making policy,
and were not in the loop.

You were positioned to take the hits
and now you have.

The question is,
how long you gonna keep eating shit?

You're 70 years old.
How many years you got left?

My nephew running things?

Not that strunz.

Not in this life.

Hey.

Here, let me schlepp that.

- You got any more in the car?
- Hm-mm.

How did you get in?

Liliana. She left early.

So, what they're saying on the TV
about the storm, huh?

Yeah. You want some coffee?

Only if you're making it.

Father, don't start that.

No, really. I mean it's
practically cocktail hour, anyway.

Glass of wine?

How about a Lillet? You in the mood?

Just came to see how you're
holding up with these indictments.

We're hanging in.

What we were talking about
a few months back...

Think these recent developments...

...have brought Tony any closer
to re-examining his life?

Making some hard choices?

I told her not to use my card!

No, that's mine. One True Thing,
just out on DVD.

I was over at Video One anyway...

...I thought you'd want to take
your mind off these stressors.

You want to stay for dinner?

Something wrong, Carm?

Tell me so I know
how many steaks to defrost.

Tony's not gonna make it.

Well, if...

As I was saying,
my real concern for Tony...

Father, he doesn't give a flying fuck.
You know it and I know it.

At least for the foreseeable future.

- Even a bigger reason...
- He's a sinner.

And you come here and eat his steaks,
and use his entertainment center.

- Carmela, the DVD is for you.
- Really?

Last week I told you
I'm not a Renée Zellweger fan!

You did? I don't remember that.

You want to watch One True Thing,
fine. At least admit it.

I thought you liked movies.
Mea culpa!

Oh, Jesus, I get exactly the same
"who, me?" shit with Tony.

Two, I don't need!

"Has Tony thought about changing?"
Father, please.

You do think I'm a schnorrer,
don't you? A parasite.

You denied it,
but clearly that's what you think.

No, you know what I think, Father?

I think you like the...
I don't know what to call it...

...the whiff of sexuality
that never goes anyplace.

I have feelings for you, Carmela,
I admitted it.

It's my job to deal with them
so I can carry on my pastoral duties.

How does Rosalie Aprille
fit into your feelings for me?

Oh, so that's it.

I appreciate everything that you've
done for me, Father Phil.

The religious counseling...

...the book on Buddhism,
the wonderful chats.

I am very fond of you.

More than fond.

But I think you need
to look at yourself.

Call this an intervention.

I think you have this m.o. where you
manipulate spiritually thirsty women.

And I think a lot of it is tied up
with food somehow...

...as well as the sexual tension game.

Whoa.

[THUNDER]

GIACULO: Mr. Soprano!
Your wife found you, good.

What are you talking about?

You haven't spoken? We left
a message on your home machine.

Your mom's had a stroke.

Stroke?

The news on TV upset her,
not that it's my business.

Anyhow, it just happened.

The EMTs are stabilizing her
for the ride to St. Vincent's.

TONY:
Ma...

I know what you did.

Your only son. Your middle child.

She can't answer,
her speech has been affected!

Yeah, my ass.

I heard the FBI tapes, Ma.
You know what I'm talking about.

George Clooney,
don't get in the middle!

GIACULO: Call security!
TONY: Uncle Jun's in jail now.

I got one more little detail
to take care of.

I don't die that fucking easy, Ma!

I'll live a long life.
More than I can say for you.

EMT:
All right, that's enough!

GIACULO:
Keep her moving!

You try to have me whacked?!

GIACULO:
She doesn't understand!

She's smiling, look at her face!
She's smiling!

Get off me!

Look at her face! She's got a fucking
smile on her face!

All right, that's enough!

[MEXICAN MUSIC ON RADIO]

She go vacation!

[THUNDER]

MEADOW: Dad, give it up. We're not
gonna make it to Aunt Patty's.

Dad, hello! We're not
gonna make it to Aunt Patty's.

Why did I buy
a goddamn off-road vehicle?

To waste petrochemical resources?

She's right, we can't keep driving.
I can hardly see in front of us.

- What street are we on?
CARMELA: I think it's Walnut Parkway.

TONY:
I've got an idea.

TONY:
Come on, come on! Inside!

MEADOW: He better be open!
TONY: Forget the umbrella, come on!

Artie, thank Christ!

We picked up the kids at school...

...we can't get home.
There's a tree across Mountain Ave.

Oh, Madonna!

We've been driving since 7,
nobody's eaten.

I got no power, I'm closing soon
as these last people leave.

Let's go to Mickey D's.

Yeah, all right, let's go.

- Let's go.
- No!

Come on! Come on!

We'll figure out something, come on!

They gave me steroids too,
but it fucked me up!

Keep away from me,
because I skeeve, all right?

TONY:
Hey, look at this!

PAULIE: Hey, what are you doing,
you all right?

TONY:
How you doing, pal?

Adriana, you look beautiful.

How you doing?

How are you?

Chiara, her brother and sister are in
the kitchen if you want to say hi.

More refugees.

ARTIE:
The gas is still working.

I'm cooking by candlelight.
I can make anything...

Whatever you got is fine.

Jose! Cabernet, por favor.
Regeleali, right?

Yeah, beautiful.

CHARMAINE:
No cigars, please.

SYLVIO: Look at that fucking lovesick
pygmy over there.

The skip seeing a psychiatrist...
How does that sit with your ass?

I usually do sit with my ass.
Why don't you sit with yours?

Hey, Pat Cooper over here.

Wait a minute, this bothers you?
You saw a fucking psychiatrist!

Not a woman!

I can't get past that.
It don't compute for me.

You're the one with the issues.

Woman issues.
I don't want to fucking go there.

Let's not.

Irregardless, I said my piece.

What're you getting at, Paulie?

Nothing.

Look, he's gonna be the new boss now.

In name, in everything.
Wish him buona fortuna.

ANTHONY: You guys got any
peanut butter back here?

Oh, God, Artie,
you saved our frigging lives here!

- It's beautiful, Artie, thank you!
ARTIE: Enjoy!

Fuck!

- Hey!
- You said "frig."

Wait a minute.

I'd like to propose a toast.

To my family.

Someday soon, you're gonna
have families of your own.

And if you're lucky...

...you'll remember
the little moments...

...like this.

That were good.

Cheers!
