[theme music playing]

[Pop] They lose 65 games only to end
up with the fourth pick in the draft.

Did they tank that shit on purpose?

Read the words, Pop. Right
there on the wall.

Brother's got a point, Henry,
much as I hate to admit that.

That's right. Pay up.

You're right, you're
right. I shouldn't have cursed.

- My bad, Lonnie.
- It's okay, Pop.

[Pop chuckles] All right.

What's their record this
year, anyway, like?

[Pop] 17 and 65.




You know that Russian kid they
drafted? He better be good.

He's Latvian.

What they need to do
is fire Phil Jackson.

[Pop] Wait a minute, Phil Jackson
ain't out there playing no more.

Phil Jackson overrated, B.

Anybody can win with Jordan and Kobe.

Phil ain't no Pat Riley.

- [all groaning]
- Aw, Riley, again?

- [Pop] Yeah.
- Here we go.

[Chico] I mean, Pacino...

Now, I get why that white
boy makes your free haircut list.

The Godfather and Scarface guaranteed
that man an eternal ghetto pass.

- Carlito's Way, too.
- [Shameek] Mmm-hmm.

- [Chico] But Pat Riley?
- [Pop] Yeah.




[Chico] Why does Pat Riley get
so much love in this shop?

Right. Even punk-ass Derek
Fisher got more rings than Pat Riley.

Uh-uh.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

'Cause the Knicks played like
men when Pat Riley was head coach.

Oakley and Ewing went hard in the paint.

Plus Anthony Mason and John Starks?

Drive the lane, you might
go home in a body bag.

All right, now I heard that.

Later with all that Instagramming,

"let's all max contract on the
same team together" bullcrap

- passing as competition nowadays.
- [all laughing]

[Pop laughs] Mmm. Yeah.

[scoffs] Didn't Pat Riley sign those
Instagram dudes down in Miami

when he became the GM?

[scoffs] Maybe.

But King James is the
truth. LeBron can ball.

[Pop chuckles] Yeah.

Now pay up, Luke. You said "bullcrap."

"Bullcrap" ain't a
curse, man. I don't curse.

- [imitating Luke] "I don't curse."
- [laughs]

You don't cut hair either, negro.

Like, really, what do
you do up in here, bruh?

I sweep hair, Shameek.

I also mop, I wash the towels,

and I make sure that plate
glass window stays spotless.

It's called work. Something
you would never understand.

[scoffs]

Slam Magazine... Hmm?

Coaches used to live
up in this piece, son.

Kevin Ollie got a
shape-up right there from Pop's.

Pitino, too.

Stylin' and profilin', that's my work.

- See what I'm sayin'? Yeah?
- Yeah. Tell him.

For real?

Doc Rivers, uh, call you yet, Shameek?

[chuckling] Whoa, all right. Play nice.

- You can't even afford a haircut.
- [Shameek] Hey, you know what?

- I'm about sick and tired of...
- [Luke] What?

Hmm?

You sick and tired of what?

About sick and tired of the
Knicks losin' all the time, man!

- [Shameek sighs]
- [chuckles]

[chuckling]

You got some hair, too, right there.

- I'm not finished.
- Yes, you are.

[door opens and bell dings]

- Hey, Counselor.
- Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.

I haven't even passed the bar yet.

- Oh, you will.
- [chuckles]

Lonnie, you got Kumon tonight. Let's go.

Come on, boy, you heard your mama.

Let's get moving.

Don't make me repeat myself.

[chuckles]

Hey, Luke.

What time you get off?

I got another job I go to
right after I leave this one.

[sighs] Black man working. Ain't
nothing wrong with that.

[inhales] Well, we should at least
try to get some coffee some time.

Maybe you'll need a lawyer one day.

Hopefully, you'll have
some cards by then.

[chuckles]

[Pop chuckles] Hey.

Be sure and tell Bessie I said hey.

- I will.
- Mmm-hmm.

How's a woman that fine with a briefcase

gonna throw it at a
brother with a broom?

That's what you don't get, youngin.

Either you have it or you don't.

- [chuckling]
- Oh, I know I got it.

Shit. [indistinct muttering]

[Pop] Whoa, whoa. See the
words... right there on the wall.

- [scoffs]
- Hmm?

- [Pop] Pay up.
- Come on, Pop.

[dryer whirring]

[Pop] Huh, there you go again.

I shook everything else after I got out.

Cigarettes, paranoia...

But the pacing?

I do it, too. [grunts softly]

Reva again?

Reva always.

Look, it's been long enough.

Give Patty a call. She's a good woman.

[scoffs]

I don't drink coffee much.

I don't think she does either.

[chuckles] Like she said, "Ain't
nothing wrong with that."

When I'm ready, I'm ready.

But you'll want a cup of something
hot and dark sooner or later...

Mr. Bulletproof.

- [chuckling]
- There you go with the nicknames, Pop.

You said your rebound chick took
a shotgun at point-blank range...

pointed it under your chin,

and pulled the trigger.

I still get the occasional headache.

Not a problem for you, Power Man.

[chuckling]

[Luke grunts]

Mmm-mmm. [chuckles]

I love it when you do
stuff like that. [chuckling]

You should be out there helping
people, that's all,

like them other fellas downtown.

Reva used to say the same thing.

Yeah, well, she was right.

You don't ever think about all
the people you could help?

You should be more ambitious.

What if my ambition is to sweep hair...

wash dishes...

and be left the hell alone?

Well, that would be a waste.

You think I asked for any of this?

I was framed, beaten...

and put in some tank
like an exotic fish.

Came out with...

abilities.

Saved your life.

More like ruined it.

Reva's dead. [exhales]

I'm a fugitive.

So?

Take my advice, brother.

The past is the past.

And the only direction in
life that matters is forward.

Never backwards.

I'm just living my life...

day to day.

[hip-hop music playing over speakers]

Why don't you watch
where you going, man?

What's the gun for, Chico?

[scoffs] Is your name Wilfredo Diaz?

'Cause he walked out on me
and moms when I was nine.

I ain't need a daddy
then and I don't need one now.

[car engine starts]

- Let's get this money.
- Yeah.

Tsk.

Hey, Pop, I gotta go. I'm runnin' late.

Hey. Look, if I wasn't paying you
in cash, I could be paying you more.

You wouldn't have to
be workin' two jobs.

I gotta do what I gotta do.

Always forward.

Forward. Always.

[sighs]

[indistinct chatter]

[vendor] Hey, yo, my man, my man.

All HD. Got it right here. Blu-ray,
too, 'cause I'm nice like that.

Tony Stark, the big blonde
dude with the hammer,

the old dude with the shield,

the green monster, and I
don't mean Fenway.

You can't get better raw
footage of the incident

anywhere else than right here.

- Hey, Luke.
- [Luke chuckles]

Every time.

It's the bleach. I can smell
it from around the corner.

Pop has got you washing
towels again, huh?

Yeah, I took a New
Yorker off the top for you.

Can't tell you what's
on the cover, though.

Hey, I hope you got Connie's rent money.

She's on the warpath.

- [chuckles]
- Thanks, Ollie.

[Ollie] Mmm-hmm.

Ten days late, Mr.
Cage. I need my rent money.

[sighs]

Here.

I count $300. Not enough.

Let me go to work and get the rest.

Tonight.

[audience applauding and cheering]

[R&B music playing]

[woman singing]

- [music continues playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

I need a favor. Short one
bartender. Dante's sick.

You got the cash you promised me?

- End of the week.
- Come on, Nate.

You can keep all your
tips out there, okay?

When was the last time you made drinks?

I know the drill.

Okay, okay. Clean up.

Put a shirt and jacket
on. Mr. Stokes has standards.

Though you can't tell by what he pays.

Excuse me?

Raphael Saadiq.

- He's as good live as you said he was.
- Even better.

So you're not impressed by all this?

I've always been proud of you.

[Stokes] This place was a roach
trap by the time Mama Mabel died.

Now look at it.

Harlem's Paradise. May as
well be the new Cotton Club.

Then I shouldn't be up in here tonight.

Well...

Madam Councilwoman...

Colon's Gym is ready to make a
sizable donation to my pocket...

and your real estate project.

Sometimes you need a face-to-face.

"Colon's Gym"?

Is that what that two-bit drug
dealer is puttin' on his tax returns?

[laughs]

Why do you even waste time with him?

Politics is where the power is, Cornell.

Forget about all this other noise.

My noise keeps you flush.

All that "keep Harlem black" rack-a-bully-ack
might get you re-elected.

- Damn skippy.
- But when the smoke clears...

it's niggas like me that let
you hold on to what you got.

You know I despise that word.

I know.

It's easy to underestimate a nigga.

They never see you coming.

- What's that?
- It's a cosmo.

[chuckles] Your jacket's a little small.

So is your dress.

Touché.

- Cornell, my man.
- Champagne.

- [Stokes] All right.
- Councilwoman.

- What are you two celebrating?
- Success.

Partnership that should have
happened a long time ago, had...

my uncle and your brother had their way.

Uncle Pete was good people.

Salvador really liked Pete.

Anytime.

- [Luke] Lookin' for somethin'?
- No.

Saadiq's still got it. [chuckles]

Stone Rollin' was a dope album.

[chuckling] "Album"? Now
I know you're an old head.

You ain't no spring
chicken neither, sucker.

Touché.

[chuckling]

[man] All right. So let
me get this straight.

I give your cousin a contribution

and it's like a get out of
jail free card for me, right?

That's something to celebrate.

No, I don't do that.

[chuckles]

[inhales] See, me...

I celebrate when things are
finished. Not when it's just starting.

[woman] Listen to him.

This is nothing to celebrate.

You saw what happened to Fisk.

You two shouldn't even
be seen together...

let alone having me all
up in the Kool-Aid.

But you're here anyway. Something
must be right about it.

Otherwise, you wouldn't have
fronted me if you didn't agree.

I have no illusions about
our family's legacy.

But you are now turning legitimate
money illegal all over again.

[chuckles] What's illegal about it?

Our product is protected
by the Constitution.

But you came to me because
you trust me, Domingo.

[R&B music playing]

In your business, people need my
product like a fish needs water.

- He can buy his water anywhere.
- Nah.

What I sell is pure.

This the kind of shit that
could blow a hole in a battleship.

But it's light enough
to hold in your hand.

Trust me, Domingo.

You can brighten someone's
day permanently with this shit.

Top of the line.

The crème de la crème.

This that grade A, military,
Justin Hammer-level shit.

A hundred large per
case. Ten cases, a cool mil.

Wholesale. Brand spanking new.

No serial numbers... because
my connect is nice like that.

[Domingo] Who's your connect?

[Stokes] He's real and
his inventory runs deep.

- So that's it.
- That's it.

- Easy-peasy.
- Nothing's ever that easy.

So what happens after
they call to confirm?

Everyone walks away happy.

UPS ain't the only brown that delivers.

My man.

[gunfire]

[audience applauding and cheering]

[Shameek] Yeah, kid. That's
what I'm talkin' about.

Yeah.

Yo, you see this? Damn!

[man] Yo! You wasn't
supposed to kill nobody, man!

I had to make a move,
Dante. Shit went left. My bad.

[gasping] Oh, my God. Oh, fuck. God.

Shut up, Chico, before I
gag you with your panties.

[coughing and vomiting]

[Shameek] Yo, y'all see this money, B?

Yo, this shit is like
some Hollywood shit for real.

[Dante] Shameek, what am I gonna
do? They're gonna know it was me.

B, there's, like, a
million dollars right here.

Cottonmouth always lookin'
down at me at the bar.

He's gonna know I'm gone. They
gonna know it was a inside job.

- You right.
- [gunshot]

What'd you do?

- [breathing heavily]
- Yo, shit works.

Yo, this shit works, Chico.

Dante would have snitched.

You see... you see how shook he was?

Come on, man. I ain't...

Ain't no way I'm splitting that
shit three ways no how, man.

Dante was crew, B. That's Dante!

Yo, I made a
decision. I'm gonna be rich.

- [Chico breathing heavily]
- Let's go.

[Shameek] Let's go! Come on!

[R&B music playing]

So you're a bench-warmer?
Or did you miss the cut?

Excuse me?

I just figured you were... one of his.

One of Cottonmouth's?

[chuckles] I hear he hates that name.

- Mr. Stokes'...
- Cottonmouth's...

Models.

What makes you assume that?

You're beautiful. But...

But what?

You're a little older than
he usually likes them.

[chuckles]

Yeah, you're definitely not
getting a tip tonight.

But I'm not finished.

Mmm.

Dumb men like little girls.

Me?

I ponder a woman.

Why don't you...

ponder me another cosmo?

[both chuckle]

[Candace] Luke.

Hey, Candace.

You got promoted?

Dante's out sick.

You okay?

Table seven wants six
bottles of Ace of Spades.

I need you to help me carry them up.

I don't like being up there by myself.

I'm right behind you. Give me a second.

Why don't you... ponder
that 'til I get back.

You're a big one, eh?

He's wearing a little jacket.

[Stokes laughs]

Haven't seen you behind the bar.

Where's Dante?

Called in sick, I guess.

You want a job?

I can find something more
suitable for a man your size.

Better paying, too.

You ever carried a gun?

No.

I'm good. Thanks.

[Dante groaning]

[cell phone ringing]

Yeah?

Shit. Fuck.

[speaking indistinctly]

[typing]

You got to walk over
to Adam Clayton Powell

if you wanna catch the bus.

Uber?

- That's what you were gonna press, right?
- What are you?

- A cop?
- [chuckles] No.

You just look cold.

If you're looking for
Mr. Stokes, he just left.

Who?

Black Escalade.

Tinted windows.

Don't you have... somewhere
you need to be?

Yeah.

Home.

Just got off.

Congratulations.

You wanna go grab a coffee?

I don't like coffee.

Neither do I.

[keys clatter]

[Luke exhales]

[moans]

[both breathing heavily]

[Luke grunts]

[Luke exhales]

[men grunting]

[cell phone ringing]

- [gasps]
- [woman] When?

I'm on my way in.

[sighs]

You talk in your sleep.

What was I saying?

Shades? Comanche?

[Luke sighs]

The job is calling me in.

Can I call you later?

[sighs] You'd need my
phone number for that.

I know where you work.

I'll find you.

What is it you do again?

[zipping]

I'm an auditor.

What's that?

Basically, I look at
the financial books.

Make sure everything's on the up and up.

And you need a short dress for that?

Sometimes you got to blend in.

Impossible.

You stand out in any room you're in.

[machinery whirring]

[camera shutters clicking]

Dominicans? Cubans?

Puerto Ricans.

[Scarfe] Thought that
parade was last week.

- Who can keep track?
- [both chuckling]

Who do you think this
guy was trying to call?

- Ghostbusters.
- [chuckles]

He can laugh. You can't.

Hey, Bailey. How you doing?

It's another beautiful day at
the office. What's not to love?

Don't you start
singing show tunes on me.

Oh, shit.

Dante Chapman.

You know him?

I know his mama.

[Stokes] Of course it
wasn't a inside job.

We had people die, too.

Look... I don't have the stuff.

Hmm. We need to talk
about this in person.

My word is still my bond.

Hello?

That's Domingo?

Yo, what's up?

[sighs]

It's above your pay grade.

What?

[man] Tell your man what's
going on, Cornell.

Nice digs.

Even nicer than when Mama Mabel ran it.

Shades.

When'd you come home?

[takes deep breath] Ooh, a while ago.

Seagate wasn't shit.

Hmm.

[clears throat]
So... what can I do for you?

It's the other way around.

Y'all got hit last night.

That expensive, exclusive,

hard-to-get hardware that
Diamondback gave you

is in a police evidence lockup.

And the money... that Domingo and
his crew were supposed to give you...

is gone.

I'm with Diamondback now.
You knew that, right?

Well, tell
Diamondback, it's about time...

Uh-uh... Diamondback tells you.

[laughs]

I'm his number one seller.

I ain't here to spank you.

But I do need to look
you in your eyes...

Was it an inside job?

No.

Hell no.

I needed that money, too.

[sighs]

It took forever to build
up that kind of trust.

We're here to get you back on your feet.

Whatever you need.

Who is "we," you fake-ass Ray Charles?

[chuckles]

I got your back, B.

Just like back in the day.

Forget about back in the day.

Why is this feeling like a takeover?

[chuckling softly] It's not.

If it was...

you would never even
see Diamondback comin'.

He wants you to win.

How can I help?

[indistinct chatter]

[Pop] Dante was one of
my kids. So was Chico.

And Shameek, too.

Just like those kids playing over there.

[scoffs] You know, that's
how you get 'em on your side.

Sweepin' up hair. Runnin'
errands. [chuckling]

Lettin' 'em hang out, play video games.

Anything is better than what's waiting
for them out there on the street.

They want a way out...

but they have too much
pride to ask for help.

So you gotta Jedi mind-trick
them into something. [chuckles]

Everyone has a gun.
[sighs] No one has a father.

Ain't that the truth.

You sure they did it?

People started callin' me half
an hour after it happened.

Shameek has always been the spark plug.

And Chico... a follower.

I just can't believe that
either one of them...

would just turn around...

and kill... Dante.

You didn't see anything going
on with either one of 'em, did you?

No.

You live and die by your choices.

This is Harlem's garden. That's
what's happening here.

You are the ones that are
gonna keep this community...

[chuckles and gasps]

Where have... Oh, God.
This is Marisol. Baby...

Oh, my God, known her
since she was first born.

And here you are
upturnin' Harlem around.

I'm so proud of you.

Ah! I saw you running
for the bus this mornin'.

All right, darling.

I'm happy you made it, darling.

Uh-uh, uh-uh, cut him off at three.

I know this young brother.
He'll eat five hamburgers.

I've seen you do it.

Now, Harlem is a community that
welcomes everyone. All people.

But at the same time,

since the days of Langston Hughes,

Malcolm X, Zora Neale
Hurston, Duke Ellington,

Harlem has been the
jewel of black America.

It's a perpetual symbol of... of
hope and prosperity and excellence.

For black lives to matter,

black history and black
ownership must also matter.

Now, my multifaceted plan for
the Crispus Attucks Complex

is just yet another way to
bring hope to a new generation,

to incubate the kind of
innovation and creativity

and progress that Harlem's famous for.

Thank you again for your
time, Madam Councilwoman.

Oh, Megan, you're
always welcome in Harlem.

- All right.
- All right, darling.

Y'all need to fall the hell back.

Zip, give her some space.

I don't like the thugs.

- You need them for security.
- Mmm, they scare people.

They pass out flyers, get
contributions, tributes.

[in Jamaican accent] Just
like in Jamaica, you know?

- Yeah, well, we ain't Jamaican, Cornell.
- [chuckling]

You shouldn't be here. We don't
need to be photographed together.

Why?

You ashamed of me?

That hurts, Mariah.

- Tony.
- Hmm?

Will you give us a moment?

I need the money you promised me ASAP.

Now you want the money?

I used federal grant and
tax-deductible donation money

to complete construction on your club

and to facilitate that meticulous
deal that just fell apart.

I don't get the money,
I'm facing an audit.

We all go to jail.

It'll be there.

What happened at the
junkyard last night?

And who's the dude in
the sunglasses behind you?

Is he after the money, too?

Either you want the
details, cuz, or you don't.

That's what I thought.

What's the word?

Confirmation of what Dante
told us while he was dying.

His friends, the one that
play on your summer league team

at the Rucker, jacked your shit.

Shameek and Chico.

Any bites yet?

No.

Double down.

Twenty large to find those fools.

[hip-hop music playing]

Tone, Passion is
twerking for him right now.

He ain't going nowhere soon. Not
with all that ass in his face.

You want me to keep him
here, you need to pay me.

Hey, yo, my man. You
know what time it is?

8:15.

[men laughing]

Stay Harlem.

Stay black.

[playing jazz music]

[cutlery clattering]

- Hey, man.
- Watch your hands.

You need to pay me.

I'm paying you under the table,

which means I'll pay you whenever
I goddamn feel like it.

What you worried about?

[Shameek] I'm not worried.

I just never met Cottonmouth
before, that's all.

[Tone] Mr. Stokes.

Mr. Stokes. That's
important. Never Cottonmouth.

All right, okay, my bad.

After what happened with
Dante, we circling the wagons.

They after us, B.

Who?

Nigga, it don't matter who.

Mr. Stokes wanted me to
check on you... personally.

[Tone] Yo, what you doin'? Come on.

Shades.

You like my Biggie photo?

Me, too.

You know what draws your
eye when you look at that?

The crown.

Wanna know why?

Huh?

'Cause everybody wants to be the king.

- [grunts and sighs heavily]
- [Shameek groans]

[chuckles]

I slapped you like a little bitch.

[breathes deeply]

I'm not the kind of man to
use a closed fist on a woman.

Where's my money?

[Shameek] I... I didn't...

Uh-uh.

Only thing worse than
a thief is a damn liar.

[grunting] Where's... my...

- money?
- [Shameek groans]

[Stokes breathing heavily] Hmm?

[coughs]

You left Dante alive. He called Tone.

And with his dying words, gave
up you and your homeboy.

We got your money.

[breathing heavily]

Now you're gonna tell us where
Chico is so we can get the rest.

[spits]

[laughing]

Yeah. Thank you.

Now I can hit you like a man.

[mumbles] No...

[grunting]

[groans]

[grunting and breathing heavily]

[rapid punches landing]

[punching continues]

[bones crunching]

[breathing heavily]

[panting]

Get his ass out of here.

[breathing heavily]

And go fetch my money.

[breathing heavily]

He didn't recognize you.

[breathing heavily]

[chain rattling faintly]

[cell door buzzing faintly]

Loneliness never goes away,
especially in places like Seagate.

If you don't make
attempts to befriend someone...

loneliness is guaranteed
to... eat you alive.

- [cell door buzzing faintly]
- [men shouting indistinctly]

[sighs]

[exhales]

I'm clear. [sighs]

I'm focused.

I promise, baby...

I'm ready.

[siren wails]

- [female detective sighing]
- Shameek Smith...

based on what they found in his pockets.
We'll need dental to confirm ID.

[chuckles] His face is jacked.

Mmm. They definitely dumped him
here. They got him somewhere else.

Mmm. Looks like he got hit by a truck.

Yeah.

- A truck with two fists.
- [Scarfe chuckles]

You know, Benjamin Franklin said,

"The only way that three people can
keep a secret is if two of 'em are dead."

First Dante, now Shameek. Chico's
the last man standing.

Benjamin Franklin...

Didn't he electrocute
himself flying a kite in a rainstorm?

I wouldn't base any
theories on that fool.

Benjamin Franklin is on
the $100 bill, Scarfe.

[scoffs] So? He wasn't a president.

That's even more impressive. Come
on, give the man some credit.

Well... So you think
Chico did this to Shameek?

Chico is what? A buck 50 soaking wet?

But we won't know for
sure until we find him.

You said Dante wasn't bartendin'
the night you were at the club.

No.

Well, did you talk to the
guy that replaced him that night?

[scoffs] I barely talked to the guy.

I mean... [inhales] all
I did was order drinks.

Well, maybe there's some
pattern, somethin' we're missin'.

We need to go talk to that guy.

That sounds like a
complete waste of time.

That's entirely possible.

But it's worth a shot.

[scoffs] All right.

You've been in this
country for how long?

And you still... can't speak English?

My English is just fine.

Show Mariah Dillard some love.

Contribute and we'll go away.

It's a family thing.

I own this restaurant.

My father owned this building.

Tell Mariah Dillard I am
not contributing to her complex.

We voted for her and
gave her money before.

And I respect Mr. Stokes.

But no. No more.

- I can't.
- [bat strikes]

Give us... the money.

Yo... I don't like your tone.

Excuse me?

You're being
disrespectful. It's unnecessary.

[men laughing]

[Koko] You need to step off, Mayweather.

I mean, what you think
you gonna do, man?

[Zip laughing]

I think he think he gonna bring it.

- [chuckles]
- [Luke] I can.

Not the way I want to. I'd kill you.

[mockingly] Ooh.

[chuckles]

I like this cat.
[clicks tongue] Yo, Amos.

What up?

Show the man what you famous for.

[laughing]

[bones crunching]

[screaming]

[Zip grunting]

- [gunshot]
- [Luke grunts]

[bullet clattering]

You want some?

I don't even like these niggas, man.

I'm sorry about your window.

[cash register opening]

Here.

- For what?
- For you.

Ma'am, I'm the one who owes you money.

You made things worse.
They'll come back again.

We want to hire you.

I'm not for hire.

But you have my word, ma'am.

I've got you.

[funk music playing]

[theme music playing]

[Trish] If you're just joining us,
this is Trish Talk

and we are discussing the recent events

that have the residents
of Harlem confused,

and some even frightened.

Line one. Sophia, you're on the air.

[Sophia] Luke Cage is turning
the neighborhood upside down

and giving it a good shake.

Trust me, no one wants to see
what falls out.

[Trish] Are you suggesting we turn
a blind eye to the problems in our city?

[Sophia] No, but I seen the news.




The man is so strong,
he doesn't have to answer to anybody.

Can you trust a person like that?

Let the police do their jobs.
That's what I say.

[Trish] Some would argue the boys in blue

don't exactly have
a sterling reputation these days.

[Sophia] Oh, yeah, missy?

Well, the next time trouble comes
banging at your door,

maybe you should call Luke Cage
instead of 911.

[Trish chuckles] You know what, Sophia?
I just might.

Uh, let's take another caller.

Line two. Hi, Amir.

[Amir] Hey, Trish,
I want to respond to that lady

'cause she's got it all wrong.

I know Luke. He comes into the fish fry.




Always treats my wife and me with respect.

Last week, two kids started a fight,

Luke took care of it
and nobody got hurt.

[Trish] I think it's noteworthy that the
only people I've spoken to that criticize

are the ones
who don't know him personally.

So many others
have merely read about him

or saw him on the news
and jumped to conclusions.

[Amir] Trish, Luke is good people
and he belongs right here in Harlem.

And I think it's important for all of us
to realize something.

We are witnessing a massive shift
in the boundaries of possibility.

But what is scary to some
inspires hope in others.

I, for one, would like to thank Luke Cage
for all the work he's doing in Harlem.

Those of us below 110th
see the good work he's doing

and we hope he's doing well.

I never thought I'd be happy
to see your ugly face.

Well, we all can't be as pretty as you.

[laughs] Ain't that the truth.

You got the goods?

You know me. I always come correct.

It's all piled up in there,
just waiting for you.

- So we're squared up?
- Mmm, nah. We ain't square.

We a few zeroes off.

About $100,000 worth.

[clicks tongue]

I'm not givin' you another dime.

Good. I don't need another dime.
I need $100,000.

No cash, no guns. No guns, no Domingo.

The ghetto CNN is workin' overtime.

If you don't make it straight
with Domingo, you're done.

Plus... I got all your cash in lockup.
Oops.

Think about how you want to spend
the rest of your life, Detective.

[snorts and laughs] Shit!

Man, your juice is water since Luke Cage
punked your peacock ass.

[grunts]

[both straining]

[groaning]

[laughing]

[grunts]

[Stokes laughing]

[breathing heavily] You shot a cop!

[man] Hey, what's goin' on over there?

Hey, man, you all right?

[Stokes] When I catch you,
I'm gonna use my hands, bitch.

[engine starting]

[breathing heavily]

[man] Hey! Hey!

[grunts]

[Mariah] I believe in Harlem.

You know, my Harlem is saturated
with jazz, and good food,

and the pure genius
that permeates the streets.

Harlem is risin'
like a phoenix out of the ashes.

I mean, that's what
all of my various complexes is about,

is restoring that luster.

Fantastic.

Uh, you mind if we go in now,
Madam Councilwoman?

The crew needs to set up for later.

Yeah, of course, of course. Go on.

- [sighs]
- Your new VH1 show?

Criminal Spinsters?

Who you callin' a spinster?

I'd wear your narrow ass out.

What's this about?

Your cousin. I'm shutting him down.

You, too.

Are you threatening me?

Never that.

Ah! Come on. Let's go inside.

- I ain't no barber, Bobby.
- [Fish] Neither am I, Luke.

But we both agree that Harlem
is a better place with the shop open.

As soon as I put Cottonmouth in handcuffs,
I'm ghost.

You could make a career
out of robbing bad guys.

- [chuckles]
- Huh!

That would be the perfect grind,
wouldn't it?

You ever think about
playing for the Giants?

[scoffs] You could make that squad easy.

[chuckles] Being hood famous
is bad enough.

I couldn't be in the public eye
on that kind of level.

Nah, man.

Wear a mask.

What for?

I ain't no hero.

That's a great slogan.

"I ain't no hero. Pay me."

[scoffs] You could market that shit.

[chuckling]

[Mariah] What do you mean
you shot him, Cornell?

Cornell! How could you be so stupid?

You didn't have to shoot him.

And just let him stick me
for a hundred large?

Hell no.

It wasn't like
I went to the meeting strapped.

It was his gun that busted off.

But you went there alone
because you knew you were wrong.

[scoffs] This is insane.

If he lives,

everything that you have built
will come crashing down.

And you are not dragging me down with you.
You hearin' me?

My guys are pickin' up the guns right now.

We'll hand them over to Domingo tonight.

I don't want the details.
I just want results.

You want results?

I don't work for you.

Okay, forget the cops.
The cops are bad enough.

- What about Luke Cage?
- Isn't your interview today?

That's where your focus should be.

Givin' off that Geoffrey Canada vibe,
for real.

That's where the money is.

Oh, forget the money, Cornell.

Forget the club. Sell it!

Walk away from all this shit.

People are still talking about
how tall you stood at Pop's memorial.

I'm proud of you, cousin.

- [sighs]
- I really am.

But I can take care of myself.

You need to take his ass out.

It ain't that easy.

Cage is bulletproof.
I've seen it myself. It's real.

Does the nigga have gills?

Excuse me?

Drown him.

Can he burn?

Can you poison him?

What about a woman?

You know he got one with his fine ass.

You find his weakness and you squeeze.

You soundin' a lot like Mama Mabel.

Don't worry about Cage.

His days are numbered.
I got something for him.

That's my word.

[cell phone ringing]

¿Qué pasó?

People, uh, are scrambling around here.

My niggas loaded up the stash
right before the cops arrived.

[Perez] What the hell happened?

[exhales]

Detective Scarfe
tried to squeeze me for 100 grand.

You put him up to that shit?

Hell no. Of course not.

Let me, uh, let me speak to him.
Where's he at?

Bleedin'... and in the wind.

You know what you just did, right?

There's no easy way out of this, man.

Why do you think we're talking?

This is why you need to learn how to text.

You always think the worst.

- What do you need, Mami?
- Not me, you.

Luke?

Yes?

Oh. You probably
don't remember me, do you?

Your girlfriend had me take care of you
when you were brought into the hospital?

In Hell's Kitchen?

Hey.

[chuckles]

Hey. [chuckles]

Bobby. Bobby Fish.

I'm sorry. Claire.
Very nice to meet you.

[Fish] Well, Claire, you...

you are far too beautiful
to ever apologize for anything.

You remember that.

- May I?
- Please. [clears throat]

[both sigh]

You didn't have to do
what you did for me.

Have you ever saved anyone's life before?

More than once I'm betting.

So?

So, the only thing you can think about
afterwards is if they're okay.

That's all I wanted to know.

[inhales deeply]

Well...

I'm still here.

How?

That shotgun blast alone
should've turned your brain into mush.

So I'm a freak.

No. You're amazing.

I don't wanna be different
than anybody else.

Why hide it?

I mean, what are you gonna do with it?

[sighs]

[exhales]

I gotta go.

- Text me later.
- Okay.

[indistinct chatter]

Listen up!

I'm hearin' a lot of whispers and rumors

concerning Detective Scarfe
and what he might've been into.

Kill that noise.

We need him back alive.

There was a trail of his blood
at the scene.

His car riddled with bullets.
We don't know what the hell happened.

Focus on that.

I'm putting out an APB.

We're closing streets, tunnels,
puttin' up road blocks.

Whatever it takes.
But remember something.

This belongs in our shop. No one else's.

Now, there's already too many
new faces here, far as I'm concerned.

And there're only gonna be more.

We need to be the ones to bring him home.

Let's do it.

How, uh... how you holdin' up?

I'd be doin' a lot better if people would
stop starin' at me like I'm dirty.

What do you know, Detective?
Scarfe must have told you something.

There's evidence that guns

from the junkyard shoot-out
were in that warehouse.

Stolen from our evidence locker?

Your partner is my top suspect.

It doesn't mean Scarfe did it.

He probably got a lead,
and went to go and check it out.

Alone.
Without pulling you in on a single detail.

Are you sure you don't know
where to find him?

If I knew, I would tell you.

So is that how we're
playing this, Captain?

Like Scarfe is a suspect
and not a victim?

He could be both or either.

We won't know
until you guys bring him in.

Us?

I need my best on this, Detective.
That was you and Scarfe.

Now I need you and Perez
to find our boy.

Yes, ma'am.

[sighs]

[Luke] You can disappear.

The whole point of livin' in New York,
no one cares about anybody.

A building fell on you.
People are shooting at you.

And you walk around without a scratch.
Who's gonna ignore all that?

What's wrong?

It's supposed to be locked.

Bobby? Are you in here, man?

[door closes]

[breathing heavily]

- Scarfe?
- No cops.

- Not even Misty.
- Why me?

'Cause you don't trust us.

We need to get him to a hospital.

No, I can't go to the hospital.
They'll kill me.

[breathing heavily]
Just like they did Chico.

They found him, they'll find me.

[Claire] He's lost a lot of blood.

Help me get him into the chair. Now.

[Scarfe grunts]

Just right here, thank you.

Bobby just bought these chairs.
He's gonna be pissed.

[Perez] You are a weirdo.

People at the precinct talk about you
like you are curandera or some shit.

Like you see things. [chuckles]

You remember Where's Waldo?

That was me as a kid.

And I could find Waldo
faster than anybody.

[camera shutter clicking]

That's what a photograph does for me.

A photograph freezes time.

It allows you to look at things,
slow down,

think about what's out of place,
and then fill in the blanks.

That's how you find Waldo.

Maybe you should work for Kodak.
That was deep. [chuckles]

[Misty] Whatever.

- His clothes are still here, right?
- Yeah.

So, if he wasn't taken,
there's a chance he might come back.

We should stake it out for a while.

Never would have thought
Scarfe would be cute as a kid.

That's not Scarfe. That's his son, Earl.

Never knew he had a kid.

Earl's dead.

Scarfe forgot to lock up
his gun one night.

Earl found it
and accidentally shot himself.

Scarfe cracks a lot of jokes,
but he rarely smiles.

There's a difference.

[clears throat]

[gasps]

- [picture frame clatters]
- Oh!

Shut it!

Dusty old bitch.

[sighs]

[Claire] Okay.

I can remove the bullet from his thigh...

but the shot in his side is worse.

If the bullet pierced his liver,
he's gonna have internal bleeding,

- and I can't do anything about that here.
- [sighs]

[groaning]

Give me one good reason
I shouldn't dump you at the 29th.

[breathing heavily] I told you, man.

They're trying to kill me.

[sighs]

- No, no, no. Don't... move.
- [grunting]

Don't get up. Stay right here. Hold.

[groaning]

Who the hell is this?

I'm the woman trying to save your life.

Thank you. Whatever.

[groans]

[sighs]

Well, this is gonna sting a lot.

[breathing heavily]

Ah! God!

[whimpering]

[groaning]

I think I'm gonna have to stay,
lay low here for a little while.

No.

- Not until you tell me what's goin' on.
- I can't tell you anything right now.

[groaning]

[panting]

Okay.

It was Cottonmouth.

He was behind everything.

So you've been working for him
the whole time?

Yeah.

[breathing heavily]

I got his guns out of lockup for him,

and then he turns around
and tries to kill me.

Go figure.

What makes you think I can protect you?

[breathing heavily]

You survived a drive-by
and a building fallin' on your head.

[grunting] I'd say you're overqualified.

You mentioned Chico before you passed out.

What happened to Chico?

I told you.

They killed him.

Don't lie to me.

Not now.

[Scarfe grunts]

[softly] Okay.

[sighs]

I killed him.

[straining]

[Claire] Luke.

[Scarfe gasps]

Don't. Please.

[Scarfe choking]

[Claire] You're not a killer.

Are you?

[Scarfe gagging]

[coughing]

We're done.

- Let's go.
- [panting]

Hey, Cage!

[gasps]

Cage!

Wait!

I'm an asshole!
There's no disputing that.

I am a despicable human being.

But Cottonmouth is a hell of a lot worse!

And I have got what it takes
to put him behind bars

for the rest of his life!

- [Luke] What did you say?
- [sighs]

I can take him down.

What do you have?

[breathing heavily]

Notes.

Detailed notes...

of murder investigations I covered up
to save his ass.

How he uses Spurlock's Mortuary...
to dispose of the bodies.

Why do you think you never found Tone?

Or Chico?

Plus...

I've got the name of every cop
on Cottonmouth's payroll.

[sighs]

That ought to be plenty to send him
on a nice permanent trip.

[exhales]

- Where are these notes?
- [sighs]

Tell me.

Now.

[sighs]

My apartment.

- Alex, no one goes in the back.
- Mmm-hmm.

And make sure these people
don't scuff up my floors.

They will stay immaculate,
Madam Councilwoman.

So, since this will be a live interview,
we'll try to keep things spontaneous.

But are there any topics
you want to focus on?

Well, Harlem.
How to shape it, how to elevate it, and...

- how my complexes will help...
- [sighing] Boring.

We've heard that speech from you
a million times and a half.

I told you I do not want a fluff piece.

Not fluff, fun. There's a difference.

Remember when Obama sang Al Green?

You wanna watch me
whip and nae nae, Thembi?

You're a popular man.

Oh, uh... the ex-wife.

Took all my money
and she still needs the dick.

Glad to see chivalry isn't dead.

[Perez sighs]

Look, look, look, Scarfe's not comin'.

He's not gonna show up
just to get arrested.

- [brakes screeching]
- [cars crashing]

- [chuckles] Look at these two.
- [man and woman arguing indistinctly]

- I think she's about to...
- [laughs] She's gonna knock him out.

Maybe you should go arrest them.

[laughs]

[arguing continues]

[lock breaking]

I don't know if you remember me
ten years ago,

when I first got bumped up off patrol?

Yeah.

It didn't seem like you belonged.
No offense.

Mmm. None taken.

A lot of people wrote me off back then.
But not Scarfe.

He took me under his wing.
He taught me how to police for real.

I have no idea
what he saw in me back then,

but he has had my front and my back.

[floorboards creaking]

If he's clean or not...

I wanna be the one to bring him in,
ask him his side of the story.

I owe him that much.

[sighs]

We're wasting our time.

Let's go.

Somebody's in there.

- No... no way Scarfe got past us.
- Well, somebody did.

[dog barking]

[dog barking]

[Misty] Hey!

Hey!

[exhales]

Hey, hey, hey, don't fall asleep, okay?

[grunts]

You need to stay conscious.
We're gonna move soon.

- [footsteps approaching]
- [door opens]

- [Claire sighs]
- The cops just saw me at Scarfe's place.

- They'll be headed here any minute.
- Misty?

Yeah... it was her.

He can't really walk.

- I'll carry him.
- Where?

The only place this evidence
makes a difference.

I just need to get a car.
I'll try and grab a cab.

No, no, no, I have a better idea.

- Claire...
- Mami, ¿cómo estás?

I texted you. Did you get it?

Our ride's here.

Yeah. No, no, no,
just come around the back.

[groans]

- [car honking]
- No. Around the back.

Okay.

[groans]

[panting]

[groaning]

[Claire] Here's our ride.

- [Luke] You gotta be kidding me.
- [Scarfe continues groaning]

Oh! Careful, man.

The van is one thing.

If my daughter gets scratched,
I'll kill you.

I don't care how bulletproof you are.

She's safe with me. I promise.

- Can we drop you at home?
- No, I'm fine.

- Muchas gracias, Mami.
- De nada.

- [Luke] You good?
- [Claire] Yeah.

- I'll drive.
- Obviously.

[groaning]

He really needs surgery.
How far are we going?

- Downtown to One Police Plaza.
- Police headquarters?

Yeah, I'm gonna hand him
and the evidence over.

The DA can take it from there.

Get him round-the-clock protection
until he can testify against Cottonmouth.

I'm dying back here.
You're still thinking about Cottonmouth?

Yeah, you should be, too.

If he's got as many cops
working for him as you say,

he'll have them in the streets
looking for us.

Call an EMT you can trust
to meet us there.

I want to remind the viewers
that we're live.

Call us using the number
at the bottom of your screen.

I know the councilwoman
would love to answer your questions.

Madam Councilwoman,
your home is stunning.

Oh, thank you, Thembi.

That's why people
are paying millions of dollars

for brownstones like this one
on Convent Avenue.

I mean, these buildings
must be preserved and protected.

Let's talk politics.
Let's talk Damon Boone.

Yes.

That Stanford-educated carpetbagger
has been saying things about

my voting record, about campaign finance,
that simply are not true.

My complexes will do
for black-owned real estate

what Geoffrey Canada has done
for education uptown.

[scoffs]
I'm just setting the record straight.

[Perez] Someone saw a green van
parked around the back.

We got partial plates.

- Well, let's hope we get a hit on it.
- [cell phone ringing]

Otherwise, I'm not sure
where else to look.

And what in the hell is taking
those damn unis so long to get here?

[cell phone continues ringing]

Yeah.

I get that.
I get it, but we ran into a problem.

And what the hell was Luke Cage
doing with Detective Scarfe?

Do I need to remind you?

If Scarfe talks,

I ain't the only one going down,
Lieutenant Perez.

Half the department's coming with me.

Find him!

[cell phone clatters]

[Zip] Where's Shades?

[exhales]

I don't know.

Let me step up.

What you need?

And how'd that work out last time?

You got a choice?

[clicks tongue]

Put the word out on the street.

A hundred large for Detective Scarfe.

I want him dead.

Dead.

Dead.

Look for a green van.

Plate's 69-somethin'.

[door closes]

[Diontey] We're near the barber shop.
We'll head that way.

Bring him to you or Mr. Stokes?

Traffic sucks.

There's a police checkpoint up ahead.

Next couple of blocks, actually.

Scarfe's people are looking for us.

They're probably closing
the whole island down.

Bridges, tunnels...

That's the way I would've done it.

[coughs]

Don't take 128.

- Which way?
- [Claire] Make a sharp right.

- [tires screeching]
- Hang on.

[horn honking]

Hold on. You seen that?
Hold on. I think that was it.

[tires screeching]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Zip... I think I just saw the van.

And the name was right.

What color did Cottonmouth
say that van was, though?

- Blue.
- Green, nigga.

Yo, I'm on them right now.

Looks like we got company.

[groaning] Is it a squad car?

[Luke] Black SUV.

I'll slow down and see if he passes.

[laughs]

- [gunshot]
- [glass shattering]

[tires screeching]

[Diontey] Back up! Move!

- [Luke] Hold on back there!
- [Scarfe groaning]

[horn honking]

- [Claire grunting]
- [Scarfe groaning]

[Diontey] There he is! Stay on him!

[Luke] Kill the lights.

There he is!

[C-Money] Yeah. Come on, yo.

[indistinct chatter]

[indistinct chatter continues]

[Diontey] Light his ass up!

[tire deflating]

Shit!

I'm gonna circle around.
You three, through the hole.

Go, go, go!

[man] Yo, man.
[C-Money] Yo, through here!

[man] Yo, here. Here.

[C-Money] Come on, let's go!

[sighs] What are we doing?

- We should just head back to the precinct.
- No.

If we hear something,
I wanna be ready to go,

not stuck behind some damn desk.

Can we at least go to Wendy's?
I dig them Frostys, man. [chuckles]

Your stomach can wait.

[dispatcher on radio] 10-13 near Bowery.
Repeat, shots fired near Bowery.

That's right near One Police Plaza.

If they're running,
why would they go down there?

Maybe they're not running.

- [siren blaring]
- [siren stops]

What the hell are you doing?

Why do you wanna rush down there?

He might need my help.

Shots fired means he resisted arrest.

They probably lit his ass up.

If he's dirty or not,
you don't want to see that.

He's still your partner.

Detective Knight.

[Perez] What's going on?

Yeah, I'm trying
to head down there right now,

but Perez is stopping me.

- Who's that?
- Okay. Why?

Who is that?

Okay. I'll do that.

Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.

That was Scarfe, wasn't it? [snickers]

What'd he say?

Not to trust you.

That you're in on all of this.

What? Hell no!
You can't believe that rat! He's lying.

He's in Cottonmouth's pocket
much deeper than I am.

Bet... bet you didn't know that, hmm?

No one was on the phone.

Microphone check, five-o.

You're too smart for your own good.
You know that?

Yeah, I'd rather be a smart-ass
than a dumb-ass.

Now give me your gun.

[grunting]

- [Misty screaming]
- [gunshot]

[Perez grunting]

- [Misty panting]
- [groaning]

[grunting]

[panting] Uh-huh.

Okay, okay.

Okay, okay.

Now cuff yourself, you piece of shit!

Roll the video.

[Mariah through monitor] You know,
my Harlem is saturated with jazz,

and good food, and the pure genius
that permeates the streets.

Harlem is risin'
like a phoenix out of the ashes.

I mean, that's what
all of my various complexes is about,

is restoring that luster.

- This is great.
- I believe in Harlem.

This is great.

Thanks for taping that earlier.

You said you wanted something different.
This is it.

I mean, you can...
you can see it all right there.

And I don't just represent Harlem.

- I am Harlem.
- And we're live.

Which Harlem is you?

- Pardon me?
- There are actually two Harlems.

The one shown to us in that video.

Historic, hardworking and hopeful.

But in this next video,
we see an entirely different Harlem.

A historically corrupt Harlem.

Your grandmother,
the notorious Mabel Stokes,

and her brother-in-law,
Pistol Pete Stokes, shown here,

were major players in it.

The boy in that photo would grow up to be
Cornell Stokes, aka Cottonmouth,

a man whose name rings out
in both legitimate and criminal circles.

Oh, that's a...
that's a personal photograph.

You... you really, uh,
have no right to show that one.

Well, how about this one?

A somehow brutal assault that took place
at the Crispus Attucks Houses

didn't make the news.

Even stranger was the millions of dollars
in cash found on the premises

in your office.

There's some people on the scene
even describe a man

who, under a barrage of gunfire,

managed to beat down
a number of criminals,

some of whom
may have worked for your family.

So you can see
how it might be difficult to decipher

which Harlem you stand for.

Despite these unwarranted
attacks on my character,

I have always tried
to make clear what I want...

which I can't say for you, Thembi.

It's very clear what you
and the rest of your media friends want.

You want a story.

Not the news. Not the truth.

Just... a story
that you will do anything to sell.

Shut it down!

Stop. Alex!

Thank you for your time.

You get your ass out of my house.

[panting]

How long before we get
to police headquarters?

I think we're near city hall.

Ah, it's cold.

Is it cold, or is it just me?

We're close.
They'll warm him when we get there.

[Claire grunts]

[gunfire continues]

[man 1] Yo, you should've died!

[man 2] Come on, man. My shit's dead.

[C-Money] Come on! Get it together, man!

[man 1] Come on, get him!
[C-Money] Light him up!

Now you're just pissin' me off.

My turn.

[men grunting]

[Claire] We're gonna go up, okay?

Come on.

[Scarfe grunts]

[panting]

[Claire grunts] One more step.

- I'm so tired.
- How far is it to One Police Plaza?

I gotta... I gotta stop now.

Yeah, we can stop as soon as we get there
and we're safe.

I gotta see my son.

You can see your son and anyone else
you want to when we get there.

[crashing]

[police sirens wailing]

[panting] You okay?

Yeah.

At least I kept one promise.

No scratches... on you.

[groaning weakly]

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold his head.

Hold my hand. Look at me.

Look at me. Breathe.

- [breathing heavily]
- Breathe.

- Breathe.
- [Misty] Hey!

[panting] Hey. Listen, Scarfe.

Okay, you've... [chuckles nervously]

You've got a lot of explaining
to do, okay?

And you're not getting out of it.

[coughs]

You better...

You better let me do
the interrogation, partner.

- I'm better... I'm better at it.
- [laughs]

[chuckling] Oh, you're better at it?
No, you're not.

- Huh?
- I got rapport.

[crying] Yeah, you got rapport.

[softly] I'm sorry.

Rafe, no.

Rafe, no.

[crying] No. No, Rafe. No.

No, Rafe, no.

No, Rafe, please!

[sobbing]

[police sirens wailing]

[R&B song playing]

Get the rest of your shit and bugger off.

Councilwoman Dillard,

can you comment on the arrest
of your cousin, Cornell Stokes,

at Harlem's Paradise tonight,

on charges of police corruption,
extortion and murder?

Alex!

Is it true that he's responsible

for the murder of decorated
Harlem police detective Rafael Scarfe?

- Thank you for your time!
- Councilwoman, can we get a comment?

Councilwoman, can we get just one comment?

- Councilwoman! Councilwoman!
- [door closes]

Shit!

Shit!

[Claire] You need to get some new clothes.

[Luke] I have some stuff back at the crib.

This is beginning to become a habit.

[sighs] Swiss cheese shirt.

Car bounces off of you.

Punching through steel and concrete.

Just another day, right?

You're safe and your mom's van is insured.

That's all that matters to me.

After all that,
you can't say you're not special.

I'm still not sure what I am.

You know exactly who you are.

And what you need to do.

[chuckles]

Pop used to say the same thing
you're saying to me.

I did right by him.

Cottonmouth's in jail... and I'm done.

You're moving on?

I think so.

It's time.

There's things with your powers
you haven't even tested.

There's so many good things
that you could still do.

Maybe I could help.

- You have ideas?
- Yeah.

Why don't we start
by getting some coffee first?

- I'm not sleeping with you.
- Whoa! Did I say anything about that?

Why can't coffee just be coffee, huh?

Okay. You didn't even
touch your coffee this morning.

You drank the orange juice. Okay?
You don't drink coffee.

[telephone rings]

[sighs]

[scoffs] Cowards.

What's going on?

They're afraid of the headlines.
Police corruption.

A crime boss who's related
to a prominent city councilwoman.

And the only person
to tie it all together is a corrupt cop.

A dead one at that.

Then I'll be the one to tie it together.

[scoffs]

You're on the wrong side
of the glass for that, baby girl.

First Fisk, then Cottonmouth.

This is huge.

But they're over there...
and we're right here.

[funk music playing]

[young Luke exhaling rapidly]

[young Stryker] One, two.
One, two, three.

Hey, switch it up.
See that shit coming from a mile away.

-Stop cursing at me.
-Oh, now you sound like your old man.

Don't start
with that "sweet Christmas" shit.

Give me four! Let's go!
Harder!

Where's your offense?
This ain't patty-cake!

Yeah!
Yeah, that's that shit.

Give me five and an uppercut.

-Let's go!
-[grunts]

Keep it going, keep it going.

Should've stuck to football, huh?

Time!

Why are you doing this, Carl?

'Cause some fool smacked you up
in front of a bowling alley?

You're gonna get yourself killed.

Uh-uh.

I'mma get this dude, Willis.
It's about respect.

We're city champs, Carl.

My arm, your legs.

Got nothin' to prove, all right?

You're runnin' around here
acting stupid, man.

-Get yourself hurt.
-You wouldn't understand.

I can't let it slide.
I'm a Lucas.

[exhaling rapidly]




Daddy ain't signing off on this.

You're alone.

-I still got you in my corner?
-Always.

Then I'm not alone.

I'm ready.

You ain't ready, Carl.

[exhales]

[exhaling rapidly]

[grunting]

[Stryker] Surprise, Carl.

This suit's Hammer tech,
made just for you.

[grunts]

You still ain't ready.

[theme music playing]

[both grunting]

[grunts]

[people screaming]

-[indistinct chatter]
-[fighting continues]

Hey! NYPD.

-Back! Back!
-[glass shattering]

Shit.

Where's my phone?

Yo, Farley, bring the camera.
The 4K one.

Luke Cage is going at it.

[both grunting]

You still hit like a bitch.

[grunts]

[Shades sighs]

-The folder.
-You don't have it?

-It's back there.
-[sighs]

Don't sweat it.

I have another play.

[police siren wailing in distance]

Alex...

Luke Cage is up on Malcolm X Boulevard.

Call Thembi Wallace.
Don't ask why. Just do it.

Tell her I'm out here.

-Where you going?
-Misty's gonna arrest me.

There's no way around it.
But I can still spin this.

-[Luke grunting]
-[Stryker groans]

You have to let go of the past
before I really have to hurt you.

Negro, please.

[both grunting]

That's all you got?
Where's your offense?

[grunts]

[groaning]

Keep it coming, Carl.

You reap what you sow.

[grunting]

[reporter] As the situation continues
to unfold here on Malcolm X Boulevard--

[TV turns off]

I know you want to be out there.

Luke told you to stay here.

He has a reason,
and I agree with him.

I know you both worry about me.

None of your business.

Your eyes sparkle
when you talk about Luke...

what he brings out in you.

He's alone.

Not that many people have his back.
He needs me.

What?
What happened?

Luke and Diamondback are...
doing what they do.

I'm getting back out there.

I... I wanna help.

Uh, you can bring down Mariah
with what you know.

You are helping.
Just wait for Misty, stay strong,

and stay ready.

I've never been good
at standing up for myself.

Neither was I...

until it counted.

You're even stronger than you know.

Never doubt that.

[in Spanish] Careful.

Always.

-[suit powering up]
-[both grunting]

Come on, Luke.

-Don't forget to breathe, Carl.
-[panting]

[young Stryker] Exhale on every punch.

No breath, no oxygen.
No oxygen, no energy.

No energy, no victory.
You lose.

[young Luke exhaling]

[grunting]

-[glass shattering]
-[blows landing]

[police siren wails]

Come on, guys.

-Back up!
-[Luke and Stryker grunting]

-[grunts]
-[crowd exclaiming]

[woman] Come on, now!
Get on back in!

Let's go.
Keep rolling.

[man] Kick his ass, Cage!

[grunting]

-[crowd exclaiming]
-[groaning]

Oh!

[Stryker] Where you going, Carl?

I'mma whoop your ass
up and down the block.

-[grunts]
-[crowd exclaiming]

[indistinct chatter]

-[exhales and groans]
-[man] Come on, Luke!

[both grunting]

[woman] Hold him back, man!

Yeah, come on.
Where you going, Carl?

[crowd exclaiming]

[man] Come on, Luke!
[woman] You can get him, Luke!

James never loved Etta.

He was gonna leave your mother for mine.

Wait, wait, wait. Yo,
the dude's talking about your moms, Luke?

You reppin' Harlem,
you better put it on him, son.

[grunting]

[Stryker] I'll take being a bastard
over being a mistake any day of the week.

Now the whole world
gets to watch you fall. [grunts]

White, Thomas...

spread out.

As soon as you have a clear shot,
take it on my command.

-[officer] Yes, sir.
-Mario, what the hell are you doing?

[woman 1] Finish him off, Luke!

[man 1] Come on, Luke!
You can get him!

[woman 2] Cage, you da man!

[man 2] Hey, Luke!
Show him who's boss!

[both grunting]

[crowd continues shouting]

Who is this man?

Did he sweep Pop's Barber Shop,

or is he former-cop-turned-criminal,
Carl Lucas,

who I heard escaped from Seagate Prison?
I don't know.

I mean, look at these super freaks.

-[Stryker grunts]
-[crowd exclaims]

This is nothing less
than a battle for the soul of Harlem.

You got this, Luke.
Throw it back at him.

Come on, Luke. Get him.
Kick his ass!

[both grunting]

[woman] Yeah! Kick his ass, Luke!
Kick his ass!

[crowd continues shouting]

[man] Yeah, do it!
Break that shit!

[woman] That's what I'm talkin' about!

Roll, roll, roll.

[suit powering up]

[snarls]

[shouting]

-[crowd exclaiming]
-Ma'am, please step back.

Claire.

Look, you gotta stay back.

I gotta contain you
and everybody else, too.

You don't believe he can win?

Of course Luke can win.

[panting] I'm done, Willis.
I'm not doing this anymore.

You ain't done.
Not till one of us is dead.

You're more like Dad than you think.

When I got shipped to Seagate...

he called me a mistake, too.

I'm not paying for his sins anymore.

And neither should you.

You want me dead?

Then kill me.

Do it!

You ain't ready.

-[bell dings]
-[Stryker grunting]

[crowd shouting]

Throw in the jab! Move!
Keep moving, keep moving!

-[grunting]
-[crowd exclaims]

[young Stryker] Take the hits!
Take the hits!

-Let him get tired!
-[crowd shouting]

-Save him.
-[both grunting]

No.

You can take it.
Keep breathing, keep breathing!

[Stryker grunting]

[crowd cheering]

[young Stryker] Let him get tired.
He ain't got shit to come back with.

[Luke groaning]

[wheezing]

[man] Come on, son!
You can do it!

[grunting]

[crowd exclaims]

[woman 1] Come on, Luke.
[man 1] Don't give up, Luke!

[woman 2] Luke, come on, man!

[woman 3] You got it, Luke!

Remember who you are.

[Stryker panting]

[chanting] Luke! Luke!
Luke! Luke!

[spits]

[crowd shouting]

[crowd continues chanting]

[chanting] Luke! Luke! Luke!

[chanting continues]

You're right.

You reap what you sow.

Let's go! Put it on him!
Put it on him!

-[crowd continues chanting]
-[grunting]

Am I my brother's keeper?

[crowd exclaiming]

No, I'm not.

-[bell ringing]
-[young Stryker] Yeah!

[crowd cheering]

[young Stryker] Yeah!

[crowd cheering]

[chanting] Luke! Luke! Luke!

On the ground, now!
We got Judas bullets, Cage.

Lieutenant, stand down.

I got you.

Councilwoman Dillard...

What?

You are under arrest
for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

-You goin' down.
-[Misty] Do the perp walk.

-You are going down.
-Take her out of here.

[indistinct chatter on radio]

Mmm, mmm, mmm.

Oh, come on.
You're not even gonna try to move?

Not even a lil' bit?

Take his tired...

broken...

false-preachin' ass on out of here.

[breathing heavily]

I should be healed up
in a couple of hours, right?

Sooner than that, Power Man.

Nah, B.

Brother deserves discretion.

How did you know...

that you could do that?

The more I hit him...

the more he dished out.

So I stopped feeding him hate.

What if it didn't work?

Well, sometimes you gotta
throw out the science and...

go for what you know.

You heard me say that?

I hear everything you say.

Even when you don't speak...

Still hear it.

[man] Luke Cage!

Thanks for keeping Harlem safe, baby.

[sighs]

I'm sorry, Luke.
I'm gonna need to bring you in.

I need a statement.

I'm done running.

How many of these you own, brother?

Looks like this place
don't wanna be a barber shop anymore.

[sighs]

Maybe not.

But whatever it is,
it's gonna be famous.

People are gonna be talking
about what went down here for years.

You ready?

You know how I feel about cop shops.

Well...

if it's any comfort,

you'll have a front-row seat
when I nail Mariah's ass to the wall.

How's Candace?

Safe and secure at my mom's place.

-Promise.
-Good.

All these people were talking bad
about Luke Cage.

But they didn't stop for one minute
to look at the good he had done.

Cleaning up Crispus Attucks by himself,
lookin' out for people...

Most of these guys wear spandex.

Who would have thought a black man
in a hoodie would be a hero?

It's been an extraordinary night
here in Harlem.

See?
I'm not the type of person

who wants always to say,
"I am right."

-But--
-I'm glad you're right.

[cell phone chimes]

[sighs]

[man] There he is.
There's Luke.

-[all clamoring]
-[camera shutters clicking]

Hey, back it off.
Back!

[reporter 1] Mr. Cage,
how does it feel to be a hero?

I'm no hero.
I'm a regular guy,

just trying to live life on his own terms,
one day at a time.

Are you single?

[reporter 2] Do you have anything
to say to Councilwoman Dillard?

[all clamoring]

[reporter 2] Have you received
any medical treatment?

[reporter 3] How does it feel
to be vindicated?

[scoffs]

[chuckles]

You can take a seat.

Mr. Cage.

My name is Inspector Priscilla Ridley.

You realize there is a warrant
still out for your arrest.

I do.
I came here to clear things up.

I haven't done any of the things
that I've been charged with.

Even the dash cam video
that everyone's talking about?

I'd like to provide some context.

Would you like an attorney?

I know a really good one.

I'm not guilty of anything.

I'll speak for myself.

-Interrogation One?
-No.

As far as I'm concerned,
he's no longer a suspect.

And we both know
if he doesn't wanna be, he'll walk.

Procedure says he should be in a room.

He won't go for a room.

Look, we can do it right here,
right now. It's fine.

What about your sororal?

You gonna let her just skee-wee
on out of here again?

Actually, it's "ooh-woop..."

and no, she's not going anywhere,
but...

we are showing her every courtesy
the NYPD extends...

very slowly.

[Mariah] I want my goddamn phone call!

Okay, Mama.
All right.

Hmm. [sniffles]

This ends here.

You got it?

I already said you don't need to be here.

I'm fine where I am.

If Claire leaves, I leave.

So be it. I'm not being redundant.
I'm just being thorough.

Luke is innocent.

Claire, I got this.
I'm good.

I know you do.
It's just frustrating.

Officer Albini in the park?

[Luke] I wasn't even in the state.

Claire and I went to Georgia.

What were you doing in Georgia?

Unfinished business.

You said no more secrets.

You don't have any scars.

The doctor who did this to me...

with Claire's help,
did it again, and I got better.

The officer in the park?
Damon Boone?

Just match the fist prints from the suit
and gloves that Stryker was wearing.

All of that was Stryker.

Why didn't you just come to me?

I didn't know you.

I stayed out of it.

Until you were right in the center of it.

They killed Pop.

They did.

I couldn't just lay in the cut anymore.

Pop knew about my abilities.

So I put them to good use.

I shut down Crispus Attucks personally.

That wasn't your job.

People needed someone that didn't require
a warrant or shield to get things done.

Call it a vigilante, or a superhero...

Call it what you will, but...

[sighs] like it or not,

I finally accepted that
that someone had to be me.

Maybe I could've helped you.

This burden is bigger than you.

Or me.

People are scared...

but they can't be paralyzed by that fear.

You have to fight for what's right
every single day,

bulletproof skin or not.

You can't just not snitch, or turn away
or take money under the table

because life has turned you sour.

When did people stop caring?

Harlem is supposed to represent
our hopes and dreams.

It's the pinnacle of black art...

politics...

innovation.

It's supposed to be
a shining light to the world.

It's our responsibility to push forward,

so that the next generation
will be further along than us.

Pop said his mantra aloud twice a day.

The kids in the shop were pissed...

but they could never unhear it.

"Never backwards..."

Always...

forward.

"Forward..."

"Always."

You forget I grew up around the man.

I wish I could've met him.

In a way, you have.

Well, hello!

Doesn't everybody have work to do?

Is Mariah still in there?

Yeah.

Well, now that I'm no longer a suspect...

you guys got any take-out menus?

I'm starving.

You know,
I kept telling Cornell it was enough.

He had enough money
to keep Harlem's Paradise flush.

Even for opening another club downtown...

like our grandmother always talked about.

[takes deep breath]

He had the talent to make it big.

But there was always another deal,
another detail. [sniffles]

And then this... this guy, Diamond Jim.

Diamondback.

Yes, Diamondback.

Cornell said
that he was his direct contact,

[stammering] whatever that means.

And he was pissed off
when those guns were stolen.

You know, in that... that thing that
your Detective Scarfe got caught up in?

There were a lot of dirty hands.

Not Cornell's.

-He didn't have the guns.
-Oh, yes, he did.

That's why Detective Scarfe got shot.

Detective Scarfe
stole them from evidence

and then gave them back to Cornell.

[stammers] I don't know any details.

I just know that Cornell
was scared and he wanted out.

And the night
when I came into the club,

that big brother that was fighting
Luke Cage up on Malcolm X...

"Hey," I screamed, and he...
he pulled a gun on me and said that...

if I didn't say it was Luke Cage,
he was gonna kill me.

He said Luke Cage?

-That it had to be Luke Cage?
-Yes.

He was firm about that.
Luke Cage. Yes!

-And Candace Miller?
-Oh, God. Candace. [inhales deeply]

She tried to protect me,
but she didn't have to.

[stammers]

I feel terrible...

that a decent man's name
has been maligned,

but I will do whatever I need to
to rectify that. I will.

You are absolutely goddamn right you will.

[door closes]

Start by telling the truth.

I am not a liar, Detective.

[Misty] Mmm.

According to the lab...

Cottonmouth was struck
in the back of the head

by a heavy, circular object...

probably consistent with a bottle,
before he was pushed.

[Ridley] How do we know
he was pushed, Detective?

The angle.

[Mariah screaming] No! No! No!

I did not want it!

[Stokes groans]

No!

[Misty] Cottonmouth landed on his back,

-turned over, and then crawled.
-[Stokes groaning]

[Mariah] You shut up!

No!

-No, I didn't want it!
-[breathing heavily]

[Misty] Judging by the wounds
on his hands,

he probably was pleading for his life

when he was smashed
by a heavy, circular base.

Now, the coroner thought
it was maybe a heavy waste basket.

But my vote...

it was a mic stand.

I went through Harlem's Paradise
inventory records with the stage manager,

and it turns out...

there was a mic stand
that was unaccounted for.

I've been around the music business
my whole life.

Equipment goes missing.

You can't trust niggas around equipment.

-Cottonmouth was weakened.
-[Ridley clears throat]

It wouldn't take a man
to kill him in that state,

just somebody who was angry...

and passionate
about seeing him dead.

And...

someone who was sloppy...

in the cover-up.

[Candace] Mariah killed him.

[Misty] What?
How do you know this?

[Candace] I heard them talking about it.

The guy who always wears sunglasses...

he was there, trying to calm Mariah down.

And that's just a taste.

I got plenty more where that came from.

I...

-I'm--
-[Misty] You don't have to say anything.

Just tell the truth.

We are right here.

Make a deal.

If you can help us nail
Shades and Diamondback,

and maybe confirm
some of Cornell's contacts,

we can make your stay...

a little bit easier.

That's all you got.

Cornell liked fooling around
with them nasty-ass bitches.

I... I had no use
for chickenheads.

You are going down.

Go to trial with that flimsy-ass shit.

I dare you.
I double damn dare you, trick!

Oh! Trick?

Whatever... Madam Inmate.

-Misty.
-Not right now.

Now.

-Don't you ever, and I mean, ever--
-Misty.

...interrupt an interrogation.

What is it?

Detective Chang just caught a body.

An African-American woman,
mid-twenties, in front of a bodega.

The victim had a pay-as-you-go phone
in her pocket.

I traced the phone's credit card.

It belongs to you.

Chang thought you might've gotten cloned,
but you bought the phone...

and you activated it.

And the victim...

had numerous text exchanges
with an NYPD cell phone number.

It's yours.

Come on.
Where are you, Misty?

I'm right here.

How recent were the texts?

I lost my phone...

at the barber shop.

Show me the picture, Bailey.

-We should verify with the family first.
-Show me the goddamn picture, Bailey.

Please.

[Bailey] The victim
appears to be Candace Miller.

Was that an important call, my dear?

-You murdered her!
-Hey, hey, hey!

-You murdered her!
-You are out of control.

-Misty, stop!
-Get off of me!

-You're hysterical. She's being--
-You murdered her!

-She's being hysterical.
-You murdered Candace

and you murdered Cornell.

-Enough is enough!
-What?

-What are you talking about?
-[Ridley] What is going on?

Candace is dead.

What?

You stole my phone.
I know it was you!

You will say anything about me,
won't you?

Where's your proof?

I loved my cousin.

[scoffs]

And I would test that love

against the recorded voice
of a dead whore any day.

Am I still being charged with anything?

-[clattering]
-No.

Not at this time.

[Mariah inhales deeply]

You have the man who killed Cornell,

Diamondback, in custody, Priscilla.

Do the right thing.

Keep him there.
He is dangerous.

That is the second time
you have attacked a civilian in here.

This shield...

ain't worth the tin it's printed on

if Mariah Dillard can just walk
out of here after what she's done.

-This system is broken, Priscilla.
-Mercedes...

you are one of the finest detectives
I have ever seen,

but you have got to learn...

that there is no getting
around the system.

You must work within it.

Candace should have been
in protective custody.

She should have been here
and I should have known about it.

Mariah Dillard walked out of here today
because of you.

Because you didn't trust our system.

Because you didn't trust me.

[sobs]

[Claire sighs]

Misty's been gone a long time. [sighs]

That's never good.

No.

We have a lot to talk about, though.

Like what?

Your future.

Your next moves.

[sighs] Well, I don't wanna talk
about that right now.

[inhales deeply]

I just wanna chill.

It's been a long day.

You're right.
It can wait.

You wanna get coffee
when we get out of here?

You accused me of not liking coffee.

That's not true.

Just depends on the blend.

I hear that Cuban coffee
is particularly robust.

[dishes clattering]

That might be
the corniest thing you've said yet.

It also happens to be true.

Oh, thank you.

Helping a sister out.

[chuckles]

The hero of Harlem.

Congratulations!

You are good for the neighborhood.

[Luke] You're not.

What about our deal?

-Where's the file?
-What file?

Buh-bye!

What the hell happened?

They killed Candace.

What? My mom...

Not your mom. She's fine.
We checked on her.

Shades or somebody used my phone

to lure Candace out of the apartment.

But I can't prove it yet.

What about her confession?

-It's worthless.
-Why?

If she were still alive,
that would be one thing.

But she admitted
to taking money from Mariah,

she changed her statement,
and now she's dead.

The definition of reasonable doubt.

And the woman she's accusing
is politically connected.

It's unwinnable.
There's no way the DA will take that case.

That's why Ridley just kicked her.

Mariah and Shades will talk.
Trust me.

I told her not to leave.

I know.

[man] Carl Lucas,

I'm Marshal Franco.
This is Marshal Johnson.

You're under arrest for your unlawful
escape from Seagate Prison.

What are you doing?

You won't need those.

-Says who?
-[Luke] Says me.

I'm done running.

I'm sorry, Mr. Cage.

I'm gonna recommend the New York City
DA's office drop all charges against you.

I have done all I can.

Thank you for all you've done for us.

Luke is innocent.

They're not arresting Luke Cage.
They're arresting Carl Lucas.

Who called you?

Once a city councilwoman identified
Luke Cage as Carl Lucas on television,

our office received numerous calls.

The information's pertinent and valid.

Mariah, again.

I'm innocent, and I can prove it.

It doesn't matter what you can prove.

You still owe the state of Georgia time.

[sighs] Okay.

Sorry.

Coffee's gonna have to wait, babe.

[Claire] Luke.

Like I said,
I know a really great lawyer in town.

I'll call him.

[sighs] Okay.

-Be careful.
-Always.

[chuckles softly]

You're so corny.

[Mariah] One of the things
that was happening was...

[continues speaking indistinctly]

[sighs]

[sighs]

Alex, you're the man.

Anything you need, Madam Councilwoman,
let me know.

It's old school.
But it's got a nice feel.

Belonged to Cornell.

It suits you.

[chuckles softly]

Yeah, it does.

[engine starting]

Let's head up.

[sighs]

It's a long trip.
You want something to drink?

I was set up for something hot and dark
before y'all messed that up.

[scoffs]

Sweet Christmas.

Well, we can stop for coffee at
Dunkin' Donuts before we hit the bridge.

Ain't the same.

Let's just get this over with.

Oh. I like Chester Himes.
This is a good one.

It's actually mine.

What were you reading before?

-[sighs]
-Some West Coast shit.

Michael Connelly.

-You ever read Harry Bosch?
-Nah.

Well, you'll have some time to read now.

No, I won't.

I don't plan on hibernating.

I was innocent before
and I'm innocent now.

I've got work to do.

[soul music playing]

[indistinct chatter]

[singing]

[music continues playing]

Sometimes backwards...

to move forward.

Always.
