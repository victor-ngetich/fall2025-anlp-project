THE HANDMAID’S TALE
“PILOT”
EXT. MAINE - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
A road curves through the Maine countryside.  
A CAR appears, driving too fast.  It swerves, fishtails, then SKIDS OFF THE ROAD.  
The car bounces across a grassy pasture and stops.  The engine revs.  The wheels spin, but the car doesn’t move.  
LUKE (27, former hipster) jumps out, looks under the car.  The wheels are buried in the soft ground.  
JUNE (28) gets out.  Carelessly pretty.  On a normal day, she’s feisty and capable.  But today she’s fighting panic.   
She leans into the backseat and pulls out HANNAH.  The threeyear-old is scared, crying a bit.   
JUNE
(to Hannah)
Shhh, you’re okay.  Did the car go bump? 
     (to Luke, urgent) Can we push it out?
LUKE
(mind racing, fearful)
I don’t know.  I think. (and then)
We need to put something under the wheels. 
Luke moves around the car, pops the trunk.  Rushing. 
SIRENS SCREAM IN THE DISTANCE.  Coming closer.    
Luke and June FREEZE -- pure terror.  They’re out of time.  Luke makes a decision. 
            LUKE (CONT’D) Go, take her.    
There’s an augural certainty in his voice.  But June is less sure. 
JUNE
We need the car. 
Luke grabs a BACKPACK, starts tossing in water bottles, diapers, a small ziploc bag filled with GOLD JEWELRY. 
LUKE
Just keep going north.  
Luke points, across the field to the woods. 
LUKE (CONT’D)
It’s about two miles to the river.  
They said someone would meet us. (and then)
Go, I’ll catch up.
The sirens grow louder.  Engines GROWL nearby.  
June hesitates, but just for a moment -- there’s no time for sentiment.  
June pulls Hannah close and RUNS FOR THE WOODS.
She doesn’t look back. 
EXT. MAINE WOODS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Tall boxelders and sugar maples shade an undergrowth of spindly Balsam Pines.  
June runs, carrying Hannah as she weaves between the trees.  
She gone a few hundred yards when -- 
THREE QUICK GUNSHOTS ECHO.
JUNE STOPS SHORT.  She turns back and scans the woods for a long, terrible beat.  
Nothing.  Just the sounds of the forest.  Trees creaking in the wind. 
Then, she sees MOVEMENT.  
NOT LUKE. 
Men in BLACK UNIFORMS.  She can hear their faint SHOUTS.  They carry SNUBBY AUTOMATIC RIFLES.   
FUCK.  June RUNS FOR HER LIFE.  
She stumbles, almost falls, keeps running.  As fast as she can.  She’s gasping from fear and exertion.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
But she isn’t going to outrun them, not carrying Hannah.  She looks around for somewhere to hide -- makes a quick decision.  
June pulls Hannah to the ground behind a FALLEN TREE.  Hannah CRIES.  June covers her mouth. 
JUNE
(almost silent)
Shhh, baby girl.  Please.
Her pursuers close in.  Six, eight of them.  All men.  
We can see them clearly now.
These aren’t police, and they aren’t soldiers.  There are no American Flags on these uniforms.  Just a symbol on the shoulder.  
Two Angel wings. 
These are GUARDIANS OF THE FAITH.
GUARDIAN #1
(pointing)
Go up around there...
            GUARDIAN #2 Do you see her?
June holds Hannah tightly as the Guardians move closer. Her mind races.  
Then, suddenly, her most primal instincts take over. June GETS UP AND RUNS WITH HANNAH IN HER ARMS.  
A Guardian immediately spots them. 
            GUARDIAN #1 There!
June runs HARD, FAST -- fueled by crystalline panic.  
A GUARDIAN sprints after her, catches up.  HE GRABS HER by the collar.  
June twists VICIOUSLY.  She punches the Guardian, a few hard jabs, and manages to pull free.    
June runs, holding Hannah close. 
But more Guardians have caught up.  They grab for her, pulling her down to the ground.  
JUNE
Get off, get the fuck off me...!
June SCREAMS, CLAWS, PUNCHES, KICKS.  A Guardian pulls away screaming, his eye bloody.  A BEADY-EYED GUARDIAN stumbles back clasping his groin.  
BEADY-EYED GUARDIAN
     (hurting and furious) Whore....
She’s a fighter.  But there are too many.  The Guardians manage to hold her.  
They drag Hannah from her arms. 
JUNE
No no no!  Don’t touch her...!
            HANNAH Mommmmmy!
June desperately tries to get free.  The BEADY-EYED GUARDIAN, still hurting from the kick to the groin, hits June in the head with a TRUNCHEON. 
June FALLS BACK as the world swims gray.  
GUARDIAN #1
(re: June)
Careful!  She’s a red tag. 
            HANNAH Mommmmmy!
JUNE turns her head.  Half-conscious, she sees HANNAH REACHING OUT FOR HER as a GUARDIAN CARRIES HER AWAY.  
ON JUNE’S FACE as her eyes flutter into unconsciousness -- 
FADE TO PURE WHITE:
EXT. MAINE WOODS - DAY - LATER
OVER WHITE.  VOICES.  DRY LEAVES, STICKS CRACKING -- THE SOUND OF BOOTS WALKING ON THE FOREST FLOOR.  
JUNE’S FACE as she drifts awake. 
She tries to focus -- she can see the trees up above, stretching into gray sky. 
She is MOVING. 
PULLING BACK, we see that June is strapped to a STRETCHER.  
Guardians carry her out of the woods.  
EXT. MAINE - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
The Guardians carry June towards the road.  June can see her CAR, still sitting in the field where she left it.
No sign of Luke.
THREE BLACK SUV’s sit parked on the road. Official vehicles with flashing lights.  They are all marked with the same angel wings symbol.  More GUARDIANS mill around. 
A RED VAN waits.  Doors open.  Like a trap.
The Guardians load June into the van.  THEY LOCK THE DOORS. 
THE BLOOD-RED VAN drives away down the country road.  As it grows smaller in the distance, we hear JUNE’S VOICE.  
JUNE (V.O.)
(calm)
A chair.  A table.  A lamp.   
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
The bedroom is perfectly neat, decorated in beiges. 
Polished wood floor, braided rug.  A folksy touch.  
It could be a room in a QUAINT NEW ENGLAND B&B.  
JUNE (V.O.)
Above, on the ceiling in the middle of the room, there’s a spot that’s been plastered over. (and then)
There must have been a chandelier once.  They’ve removed anything you can tie a rope to.  
JUNE sits, hands folded, looking out of the window. She wears a full RED DRESS, almost a cloak.
A starched-white bonnet covers her head, obscures her face.
            JUNE (V.O.) There’s a window with white curtains.  The glass is shatterproof. But it isn’t running away they’re afraid of. A Handmaid wouldn’t get far. It’s those other escapes, the ones you can open in yourself.  
(and then)
Given a cutting edge.  
(and then)
(MORE)

            JUNE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Or a twisted sheet and a chandelier. 
It is an otherworldly tableaux.  A woman draped in red, in this dollhouse-perfect bedroom. 
            JUNE (V.O.) I try not to think about those escapes. It’s harder on Ceremony day.  
(and then)
Thinking can hurt your chances. And I intend to survive. I intend to survive for her. (and then)
My name is Offred. I had another name, but it’s forbidden now. So many things are forbidden now.
June is now OFFRED.  
Welcome to our world.  Welcome to Gilead.
Somewhere in the house, a CLOCK CHIMES loudly.  
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - HALLWAY/STAIRS - DAY
Offred walks down the stairs.  She moves so quietly, it’s like she doesn’t even push any air in front of her. 
She stops outside the kitchen door. 
IN THE KITCHEN, RITA (50, gruff) kneads bread. She wears a DULL GREEN DRESS -- the uniform of a “Martha” -- the caste of domestic workers in this society. 
Offred watches her kneading the heavy bread dough. 
OFFRED (V.O.)
Rita makes the bread from scratch. It’s the kind of thing they like the Marthas to do.  (and then)
A return to traditional values, that’s what they fought for.
Rita sees Offred. 
RITA
(annoyed)
Always showing up when I’m in the midst.  Hold your horses. 
She wipes her floury hands on her apron and pulls a set of 
KEYS from her pocket.  She crosses to a cabinet, unlocks it.
Offred waits in the hallway.  A SOFT CLICKING CATCHES HER ATTENTION.  Offred looks across the hall.  A door, slightly open, reveals a perfectly-decorated SITTING ROOM.  
In the sitting room, Offred can just see the shoulder of a WOMAN IN BLUE.  She sits in a chair, knitting.  Her needles click against each other.  
LOOKING AT THE WOMAN, OFFRED FLASHES BACK TO:
INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK
Outside the sitting room window, a hard rain falls.  
OFFRED stands in her RED CLOAK, a red suitcase beside her.  They are still damp from the rain.  
She is alone in the room.  Eyes cast down.  An unmoving figure in red.
There are no books in the room.  No visible writing of any kind.  And no technology.
The only sound is the rain hitting the window.  A spring rain, with plump, cold drops.
SERENA JOY opens the door, strides in.  She’s a brittle 40, in the signature pale blue of a Commander’s wife.  
Offred starts to look towards Serena -- it’s a reflex.  But she stops herself, keeps her head down.
Eyes to the floor. 
Serena sees Offred twitch and catch herself.  Serena takes a beat to enjoy her power at work.  And then -- 
            SERENA JOY So.  Here you are.
Offred keeps her eyes lowered.  
OFFRED (V.O.)
Here I am.
(and then)
Aunt Lydia said it was best not to speak to the wives unless they asked you a direct question. Think of it from their point of view, Aunt Lydia said.  It isn’t easy for them. 
(and then)
Boo fucking hoo.
Serena Joy sits, takes out a cigarette.  Lights it.  She looks Offred up and down. After a long beat -- 
SERENA JOY
You can sit down.  I don’t make a practice of it, but just this time. 
Offred considers -- she is carefully choosing every word, every movement.  This is a dance.  If Offred missteps, there will be consequences.
Offred sits, folds her hands in her lap.  
            SERENA JOY (CONT’D) So, old what’s-his-name didn’t work out?
            OFFRED No, Ma’am. 
SERENA JOY
Tough luck.  This is your second posting, then?
            OFFRED Yes, Ma’am. 
SERENA JOY
Good.  Our last one was brand new.  It was like training a dog.  And not a very smart one. (and then)
I expect you know the rules?
            OFFRED Yes, Ma’am. 
SERENA JOY
Don’t call me ma’am.  You’re not a Martha.  
From the doorway, someone CLEARS THEIR THROAT.  Offred glances over and sees COMMANDER WATERFORD (50’).  Tall, a little thick in places, not necessarily handsome, but... 
commanding. 
Offred IMMEDIATELY stands up, bows her head obediently.
            SERENA JOY (CONT’D) Well.  Look what the cat dragged in. 
(re: Offred)
This is the new one. 
COMMANDER
(to Offred, too casual)
Hello.
     (then, catching himself) Blessed be the fruit. 
OFFRED
May the Lord open. 
A beat. And then --
COMMANDER
I’m Commander Waterford.  Fred Waterford.
            OFFRED I am Of-fred. 
COMMANDER
Right. 
     (and then) Well.  Good. 
The whole process is proscribed, unnatural.  The Commander turns to leave, pauses --  
COMMANDER (CONT’D)
(brightly)
Nice to meet you.
Serena Joy REACTS with a glare -- this isn’t part of the ritual greeting. It is far too intimate.
Offred turns the words, and the rules, over in her head.  She doesn’t know how to play it, what to say.  She chooses --  
            OFFRED Thank you. 
The Commander leaves.   
Offred shifts in the uncomfortable silence.  The rain hits the window.  An uneven rhythm of taps. 
Offred sits down again. 
SERENA JOY
     (sharply) Get up.
Offred gets up.
            SERENA JOY (CONT’D) I want to see as little of you as possible. Understand?

OFFRED
Yes, Ma’am...
     (and then) Yes. 
SERENA JOY
Mrs. Waterford. (and then)
You’ll find that in this house, we believe in mercy.  But if I get trouble, believe me, I’ll give trouble back. 
Offred stares down at the floor, as we -- 
END FLASHBACK
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - HALLWAY/STAIRS - DAY
Rita steps up, bringing Offred out of her memory. 
RITA
Tell them fresh for the eggs, not like last time.  Tell them who it’s for and they won’t mess around.
Rita hands her a wicker shopping basket, then tears some paper tokens from a ration book.
They have pictures on them, but no words. Twelve eggs, a piece of cheese, a fish. 
            OFFRED Okay. 
Rita offers a frown and heads back to the work.  
            OFFRED (V.O.) The frown isn’t personal.  It’s really the red dress she disapproves of.  (and then)
I’ve heard Rita talking to Marthas from other houses.  “I wouldn’t debase myself like that,” they say.  Or “It’s not what you call hard work.  Do the shopping and spread your legs.”    
Rita goes back to kneading the bread, sinking her hands into the soft dough.  Offred watches, hungrily. 
RITA
You gonna stand there all day? Be rude, leaving your friend out there waiting. 
OFFRED (V.O.)
I want to tell her that Ofglen is not my friend, that I’ve exchanged barely fifty words with her in the two months since I got here.  I want to tell her that I sincerely believe that Ofglen is kind of a pious little shit with a broomstick up her ass. 
And then...
            OFFRED Under his eye. 
Offred leaves.  Off Rita -- back to work.  
EXT. WATERFORD HOUSE - DAY
Offred comes out, walks down a path bordered with flowers.  The garden is beautiful, perfectly kept.  
A FEW GUARDIANS patrol, guns slung over their shoulders. 
NICK BLAINE (26) digs in the flowerbed.  He’s attractive in a boyish sort of way.  He wears a Guardian’s uniform, with the jacket off and the shirt open at the throat.
OFFRED (V.O.)
(re: Nick)
He’s one of the Guardians assigned to the house.  He drives for the Commander, but sometimes Serena Joy has him help her in the garden.  Do some of the heavy lifting. (and then)
I know his name.  Nick.  I heard the Commander speaking to him once.  
“Nick, I won’t be needing the car.” 
Offred stops.  Nick’s wheelbarrow and garden tools block the path.  She doesn’t say anything, waits for him to notice. 
NICK
     (re: the roadblock) I’m sorry. 
Offred gives a tiny nod, doesn’t look up.  Nick starts to clear the path.  
Offred looks at his sweaty, muscled forearms as he lifts the heavy tools.  She forces herself to look away.  
            NICK (CONT’D) Going shopping?
            OFFRED (V.O.) No, Nick, I’m gonna knock back a few mojitos at the Oyster House Bar.  Wanna come along?
And then --
            OFFRED Yes. 
NICK
If you’re going to All Flesh, avoid the chicken.  I read they’ve got crazy levels of dioxin.
Offred hesitates, weighs her responses.  Always so careful. 
OFFRED
I’m going to Loaves and Fishes. 
NICK
Then you should avoid the tuna.
A beat, and then -- 
            OFFRED Mercury?
NICK
No, I just don’t like tuna very much.
Nick smiles.  It is almost a normal moment.  The garden path is clear, but Offred lingers. 
OFFRED (V.O.)
He lives here, over the garage.  Low status, he hasn’t even been issued a woman.  Maybe he’s lonely.  
Maybe he watches me. 
     (and then, horribly) Maybe he’s an Eye. 
Oh FUCK.  We can see the terror in her eyes, even if we don’t know exactly why.  Later, we’ll find out “The Eyes” are the secret police of Gilead.  The Gestapo.  Offred goes pale, looks away.   
OFFRED
     (as saintly as possible) Peace be with you.
She hurries away, through the gate.  OFGLEN waits on the sidewalk. In her red cloak and white bonnet, she is another Handmaid.  Offred’s twin, dressed exactly alike.  Head bowed. 
OFGLEN
Blessed be the fruit.
Offred is still rattled -- did she make a mistake with Nick?  A fatal mistake?  It’s possible. 
OFFRED
(shaky)
May the Lord open. 
Ofglen notices that she is agitated. 
OFGLEN
Are you okay, Offred?
OFFRED
Yes, very well, praised be.  You are so kind to ask.
     (and then, V.O.) Pious little shit. 
Offred tries to calm herself as she walks off with Ofglen.  
EXT. GILEAD - UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
Idyllic.  Stately homes, with beautiful gardens, hiding so much darkness. 
MARTHAS walk on the streets, some GUARDIANS.  No wives, no Commanders.  A few Marthas push strollers or walk with boy children.  THERE ARE NO GIRL CHILDREN OUTSIDE. 
The cars that pass are either commander-black or wife-blue, luxury gas guzzlers.  A few MILITARY HUMVEES pass -- black with the winged symbol on the doors.  
Offred walks with Ofglen.  
OFFRED (V.O.)
We go everywhere in twos.  This is supposed to be for our protection, but that’s bullshit.  The truth is we’re watching each other for any whiff of heresy. (and then)
She is my spy, as I am hers.  
(and then)
(MORE)
            OFFRED (V.O.) (CONT'D) She has never said anything that was not strictly orthodox.  But then neither have I.  She may be a true believer, a Handmaid in more than name.  I can’t take that risk. I can’t end up on the Wall and leave my daughter here.  Alone. (and then, aloud)
We’ve been sent good weather.
OFGLEN
Which I receive with joy. (and then)
The war is going well, I hear.
Offred reacts, hungry to hear any news.  But she quickly buries her desire, answers as evenly as possible. 
OFFRED
     (eager, playing cool) By His hand.
OFGLEN
They’ve defeated more of the rebels.
OFFRED
Praise be.
     (and then, very carefully) What were they?  The rebels.
Ofglen hesitates, narrows her eyes.  
OFFRED (V.O.)
(re: Ofglen’s look)
When she gives me that look, I want to punch her in the face. (and then)
But she’s right.  Any curiosity is dangerous. But I’m ravenous for news.  Even if it’s false news it must mean something.  
Ofglen’s suspicion wanes.  She smiles. 
OFGLEN
Baptists, I think.  Suicide bombers.  They had a stronghold in the Blue Hills.  
Offred waits, eager for Ofglen will offer more.  She doesn’t.  
After a long beat, Offred abandons her hopes -- 
OFFRED
     (unfulfilled) Praise be.  
Offred and Ofglen pass a SMALL WHITE CHURCH.  
Behind a wrought iron gate, Commander’s Wives in blue dresses stand chatting near a line of idling black SUV’s.  The door to the church opens.
A dozen pre-pubescent GIRLS emerge from the church, dressed in long, pink and white smocks.  Virginal.  ARMED GUARDIANS escort them. 
Offred STOPS -- stares at the girls.  ONE GIRL looks her way, smiles.  On OFFRED as we -- 
FLASHBACK TO:
EXT. BEACH - DAY - FLASHBACK
Three-year-old HANNAH runs into the breaking waves, laughing.  Pure joy. 
END FLASHBACK:
EXT. GILEAD - UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD / CHURCH
Back on Offred, rocked by her memory.   
OFGLEN
Offred.  
(and then)
We should go.  
She turns, trembling slightly, fighting her emotions.  They walk on. 
INT. LOAVES AND FISHES - DAY
Offred and Ofglen enter.  A sign shows a LOAF OF BREAD and a FISH.  Pictures, no writing. 
Only women are shopping -- Handmaids, some Marthas, and a few ECONOWIVES -- working-class wives in multicolored dresses. 
It is a grocery store.  Some bare shelves, not too much produce, but otherwise, pretty ordinary. 
It’s like Ralphs.  Except for the armed guards patrolling the aisles, and the packages of food marked with pictures.  
There is no writing anywhere. 

Offred is still shaken by her memory of Hannah.  She follows Ofglen by rote, not thinking.  Two Handmaids, OFSAMUEL (19, talker) and OFERIC (32, observant) step up.  Excited whispers. 
OFSAMUEL
Under his eye. (chatty)
Did you see?  They have oranges.
OFGLEN
Praised be.  The war in Florida must be going well. 
            OFSAMUEL I know, right?
OFGLEN
(to Offred)
Your Mistress likes oranges.  
OFERIC
(cynical)
Just make sure she knows you got them.  Don’t let a Martha take the credit. 
Offred fights to focus on the conversation.  Finally says...
OFFRED
I don’t have a token for oranges. 
OFSAMUEL
Tell them you’re Commander 
Waterford’s.  He’s very high up.  His name is in the news...
The Oferic looks to her, sharply.  Ofsamuel realizes, goes ashen.  
            OFSAMUEL (CONT’D) I didn’t read it.  I promise.  I just overheard my Mistress...
Ofsamuel is digging herself in deeper.  Ofglen comes to the rescue. 
OFGLEN
We should get some oranges before they’re all gone.   
They all walk off. Offred waits a moment, still shuddering from her memory of her daughter.  A beat, then she follows. 
TIME CUT TO:
INT. LOAVES AND FISHES - MINUTES LATER
Crates of oranges are stacked into a makeshift display.  Women crowd around.  Ofglen, Oferic, and the other Handmaids take oranges.
Offred just stares at the crates.  Mind elsewhere. 
OFGLEN
Praise be His bounty. (to Offred) Take some. 
Offred takes a few oranges, puts them in her basket.  As she does -- 
OFFRED
They took my daughter.  I don’t need oranges.  I need her back.  I need to scream.  I need to grab the nearest machine gun. (and then)
I need someone to talk to. (and then)
I wish Moira was here.
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. RED CENTER - GYMNASIUM - DAY - FLASHBACK
ANGLE ON a young woman -- MOIRA (28, quick and profane) seems to be listening intently.  She wears a red handmaid’s dress, sits at a SCHOOL DESK. 
WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- 
A former high school has been turned into a indoctrination center for Handmaids.  
            AUNT LYDIA (O.S.) They made such a mess of everything.  They filled the air with chemicals and radiation and poison.  
In the gym, Moira and other WOMEN in red dresses sit at rows of desk -- hands folded, silent, obedient, eyes front.  
Stern women in brown uniforms watch the class.  Cattle prods hang from their belts.  These are AUNTS -- brutal overseers of the Handmaids. 
AUNT LYDIA (50, pleasant and sadistic) lectures to the women.  
A computer projects power-point slides on a screen. 
It shows a graph of FALLING BIRTH RATES.  
            AUNT LYDIA (CONT’D) So God whipped up a special plague, just for them.  A plague of infertility. Do you blame Him?  I most certainly do not. 
A door opens.  Moira turns her head slightly, just enough to see. 
Across the room, GUARDIANS lead in a group of NEW ARRIVALS, including JANINE (22, ballsy) and OFFRED.  
Offred shuffles, looking a little sleepy.  Drugged.
            AUNT LYDIA (CONT’D) And as birthrates fell, what did they do?  They made things worse.  Can you imagine? Birth control pills, morning after pills, murdering babies in the womb?  Cutting then into pieces.  
Aunt Lydia takes a beat, as if the pain is too much for her.  She steadies herself, goes on.
            AUNT LYDIA (CONT’D) How could they have done such things?  Just so they could have their orgies. Their Tinder.  So they could rut about like beasts.   
Such wickedness.  (and then)
They were dirty women.  They were sluts.  
The Guardians leads the women to the desks. Offred looks over the room of women.  She spots MOIRA.  Eyes connect.  Recognition.  WE FLASHBACK TO:
INT. CAMBRIDGE APARTMENT - MORNING - FLASHBACK
Offred, in normal clothes, sits at the kitchen table, working on a laptop.  Notes and books are scattered across the table. She sips coffee.
It all seems so normal.  And so decadent, compared to life in Gilead. 
Moira enters, T-shirt and pajama bottoms.  Bed head. 
MOIRA
Got any cigarettes?

OFFRED
In my jacket maybe.
MOIRA
Where’s your jacket? 
OFFRED
(exasperated)
Dude, I need to finish this.  It’s due by ten. 
MOIRA
For Dietrich’s class?  (off her nod) What’s it about?
OFFRED
Campus sexual assault.
            MOIRA For or against?
This gets a little grin from Offred.  A PRETTY WOMAN comes out of Moira’s bedroom, leans into the kitchen. 
WOMAN
Moira honey? I’ve got to get to work.  
(and then)
We should do this again. 
MOIRA
Babe, I would love that.
The woman smiles, waves politely to Offred, then heads out. Offred looks to Moira. 
OFFRED
You don’t even remember her name, do you? 
MOIRA
(busted)
Just give me a fucking cigarette.
Two friends. 
END FLASHBACK:
INT. RED CENTER - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUING
Moira and Offred meet eyes.  Moira shakes her head just slightly.  
No.  
Then Moira looks away.  
Offred understands the message -- don’t let anyone see that we know each other.  She walks past Moira, not offering any recognition.  She sits down.
Aunt Lydia continues her lecture, full of devotion. 
AUNT LYDIA
...but you are special girls.  
Fertility is a gift directly from God.  He left you intact for a 
Biblical purpose.  (and then)
Like Bilhah served Rachel, you girls will serve the Leaders of the 
Faithful and their barren wives.  You’ll bear children for them.  You are so lucky.  So privileged. 
JANINE (23, ballsy) another new arrival, sits down behind 
Offred.  Leans to her -- 
JANINE
(whisper)
Welcome to the friggin’ looney bin, right? 
Janine grins.  Immediately, an AUNT strides over.  Without a word, she HITS JANINE IN THE HEAD. 
            JANINE (CONT’D) Jesus, what the fuck!?
Aunt Lydia comes over.  A murmur runs through the woman.  
            AUNT LYDIA All right, girls.  We’ll have quiet.  Like little mice. (to Janine)
Welcome to the Rachel and Leah 
Center. 
     (and then) Up. 
JANINE
     (defiant) Fuck you. 
AUNT LYDIA
Blessed are the meek, Dear.  
Aunt Lydia quickly pulls out her prod and jams it into Janine’s neck.  She SHOCKS HER, HOLDING THE PROD AGAINST HER 
SKIN.  
Janine screams, cowering.  Three Aunts descend, pulling Janine to her feet and dragging her away.
Aunt Lydia heads back to the front of the makeshift classroom. 
OFFRED (V.O.)
Blessed are the meek.  (and then)
They always leave out the part about inheriting the earth. 
AUNT LYDIA
Back to work, shall we, girls?
On Offred, as Aunt Lydia returns to her lecture. 
INT. RED CENTER - CAFETERIA - NIGHT
The cafeteria has been converted into a dorm for the Handmaids in training. 
Blue moonlight glows through the windows, illuminating neat rows of narrow cots.  
Moira and Offred lie in their beds, talking quietly, carefully. 
OFFRED
I tried to run with her, but she was so heavy. I tried. 
MOIRA
(so much sympathy)
Hey, I know.
(and then)
Those motherfuckers were chasing you with machine guns. None of this is your fault.  
OFFRED
(doesn’t know)
I know.
(and then)
Then I heard shots.  He must have tried to slow them down somehow, give us a better chance to get to the border.
(and then)
They just shot him.
Moira reaches out, touches her face. 
MOIRA
Don’t lose hope, darlin’.  He’s always been a survivor.
OFFRED
No.  He’s dead, Moira. (and then)
What about Odette?
MOIRA
Reclassified as an Unwoman and sent to the colonies.  She was gone in the first dyke purge.  She was on top of their list. (and then)
We were stupid.  They told us exactly what they believed in.  What they wanted to do. We called them wing-nuts.  
            OFFRED They are.
MOIRA
We should’ve taken them seriously. We didn’t look up from our fucking phones until it was too late. 
Across the cafeteria, the door opens loudly. Offred and Moira immediately close their eyes and feign sleep.
Two Aunts drag JANINE into the room.  She’s limp, moaning.
A BANDAGE COVERS HER RIGHT EYE.  There is a small stain of BLOOD on the gauze.
They drop Janine onto her cot and leave.  After the door shuts, the room is silent.
Janine curls up and whimpers, softly.  
Offred listens.  It is a terrible sound.
OFFRED
What did they do to her?
MOIRA
If my right eye offends thee, pluck it out.  
(and then)
We’re breeding stock, kid. You don’t need eyes for that. 
Offred tries to absorb this unreality.  Janine whimpers.
OFFRED
We are down the rabbit hole or something. 
MOIRA
Yup, no joke.
(and then)
God, I’d kill for a fucking cigarette.
Offred musters a smile.  Off these friends, we -- 
END FLASHBACK
EXT. GILEAD - THE WALL - DAY
FOUR BODIES hang by their necks from hooks set into the brickwork.  Hands tied in front, white bags over their heads. 
Each body has a placard hung around its neck:  A human fetus, a black triangle, a red inverted cross...
Pull back to reveal OFFRED and OFGLEN looking at the wall.
OFFRED
A priest, a doctor, a lesbian.  (and then)
I think I heard that joke once.  
This wasn’t the punchline. (and then)
Moira isn’t up there.  She could still be dead, I know.  There are a hundred other walls in a hundred towns, a thousand mass graves in the woods. 
(and then)
But she isn’t here, and that gives me hope.  It may be false hope, but that’s a sort of hope nonetheless. 
CHURCH BELLS ring out.  Time to go home. 
OFGLEN
Should we take the long way, by the river?
Offred nods, then remembers.  Painfully.  It’s Ceremony day for Offred.
OFFRED
I can’t.
(and then)
I have to get ready for the Ceremony.
Offred looks gray.  But Ofglen reacts with restrained joy. 
OFGLEN
Praised be.  We’ll go straight home then.
(and then)
May God bless your endeavor and bring forth His miracle. 
OFFRED
     (hiding dread) Praised be. 
CUT TO:
INT. - WATERFORD HOUSE - BATHROOM - TWILIGHT
The bathroom is decorated with blue wallpaper, curtains, a blue fake-fur cover on the toilet seat.  Perfectly neat.  
It’s a bathroom that might belong to your great-aunt. 
Steam rises from the full bathtub. 
Offred undresses, removing her white wings and shaking loose her long hair. 
            OFFRED (V.O.) They took out the mirror.  And there are no razors, of course.  There were incidents in the bathrooms at the beginning. Cuttings, drownings.  Before they got all the bugs ironed out. 
She removes her heavy red cloak, the petticoats, the red stockings, the loose white cotton pantaloons.  
Offred slides into the tub.  Hot water.  It feels lovely.  
            OFFRED (V.O.) The bath is required before the ceremony.  I am to make myself clean.  But it’s also a luxury.  Just to take off the veil, to feel my own hair again with my own hands, is a luxury.   
Offred washes her hair.  For the first time, we notice a small RED METAL CUFF on the top curve of one ear -- there’s a six digit number etched in the surface.  
The cuff could be jewelry, in another time, edgy and urban.  
But this isn’t jewelry.  
It is an ear tag, akin to the identity tags used on cattle.  
Offred lays back and closes her eyes. 
On OFFRED, WE FLASHBACK TO:
INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK
Offred takes a bath with baby MAYA -- she’s six months, fat and slippery.  Maya squeals.  Offred buries her face in Maya’s wet and perfect neck.  Inhales deeply. 
OFFRED (V.O.)
She comes to me so clearly in the bath.   
A perfect memory.  But dark questions intrude...
OFFRED (V.O.)
(rising fear)
When do I come to her? (and then)
Does she even remember me?  Please, God, let her remember me.
The memory bursts abruptly -- 
END FLASHBACK
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - BATHROOM - TWILIGHT
...as Offred jerks back into reality.  Her eyes open.
OFFRED (V.O.)
They probably told her I was dead.  That’s what they would do.  Best thing for everyone, they’d say.  (and then)
When people say that, they always mean that it’s the best thing for them.  It never means the best thing for you.
Off her face...
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Offred sits on the bed, dressed and still.  Hands folded in her lap.  A tableaux.  Her mind races. 
            OFFRED (V.O.) I am washed and brushed like a prize pig. 
(and then)
(MORE)
            OFFRED (V.O.) (CONT'D) I want to know what I did.  To deserve this. 
Offred FLASHES BACK TO:
INT. RED CENTER - GYMNASIUM - DAY
Chairs are arranged in a circle, with a single chair at the center.  Offred, Moira, and the other Handmaids-in-training sit on the perimeter.  
Janine sits in the central chair. She wears a SMALLER BANDAGE over her missing eye.  Aunt Lydia stands beside her.  
Other Aunts stalk the outside of the circle, watching all the women, cattle prods ready. 
JANINE
The boys kept coming down into the basement for hours, it felt like.  At first they took turns, but later I think there were two or three at a time.  I knew most of them from school.  I just couldn’t believe they were doing it, that it was happening.   
            AUNT LYDIA But it did happen.
            JANINE Yeah.
AUNT LYDIA
And whose led them on?  Whose fault was it?
Janine shrugs, weakly.  She hangs her head. 
            AUNT LYDIA (CONT’D) Whose fault was it, girls?
Offred looks at Janine.  She’s crying now.  Moira and the other women in the circle respond, pointing and chanting in unison.  Offred joins, weakly. 
WOMEN
Her fault! Her fault! Her fault!
Aunt Lydia gives Offred a stern look -- she is not showing enough enthusiasm.  Moira leans to her. 
MOIRA
     (urgent whisper) Come on, do it. 
            AUNT LYDIA And why did God allow such a terrible thing to happen?
Aunt Lydia looks at Offred.  Offred steels herself and joins in with terrible energy.  The women point at Janine, accusing. 
WOMEN
Teach her a lesson! Teach her a lesson! Teach her a lesson!
It’s a scene of horror from another century. 
END FLASHBACK
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
A CLOCK CHIMES, bringing Offred out of her memory.  She stands up, walks out of the bedroom. 
CUT TO:
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT Offred enters.  The room is quiet, empty.  
OFFRED (V.O.)
I am here before the others.  That, too, is part of the ritual.  
Offred steps to her spot, marked by a small RED CUSHION. She kneels.  Head down, hands in her lap. 
OFFRED (V.O.)
I am to wait.  I am to be a woman in waiting.
(and then)
Ordinary, said Aunt Lydia, is what you’re used to.  This may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a time it will.  It will become ordinary. 
(and then)
I want to throw up. 
Rita enters, wiping her hands on a dish towel.  She takes her place, standing behind Offred.  
Nick enters next.  Stands beside Rita.  A long beat. 
RITA
Wish they’d hurry up.  Some of us got things to do, you know. 

NICK
Hurry up and wait.  
Footsteps in the hall, then Serena Joy enters.  She sits down.  Lights a cigarette.  A beat, and then...
SERENA JOY
Late again, as usual.  (then, to no one)
What is it about men? 
A long beat.  There is a knock at the door.
OFFRED (V.O.)
The knock is prescribed.  This room is her domain.  It’s a little thing, but in this house, little things mean everything. 
            SERENA JOY Come in.
The Commander opens the door.  He is dressed in his black uniform.  He looks over the assembled group. 
COMMANDER
Good evening.
     (and then, to Serena Joy) Dear. 
He smiles.  Almost warmly.  She nods in return. He pulls out a key on a brass ring.  
            COMMANDER (CONT’D) Then let’s get started.
A polished wooden box sits on the table beside his chair.  The commander uses the key to unlock the box.  Extracts a King James BIBLE, opens to a marked passage.  
Clears his throat.
COMMANDER (CONT’D)
Excuse me.
(reading)
And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister, and said unto Jacob, Give me children or else I die...
He continues reading in V.O. As we -- 
CUT TO:
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - SERENA JOY’S BEDROOM - LATER
CLOSE ON OFFRED’S FACE.  We can hear a soft GRUNTING.  Offred moves a bit, in the same rhythm.  
COMMANDER (V.O.)
And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her...
PULLING BACK, we reveal that Offred is lying between Serena Joy’s open legs.  
Serena Joy lies, fully clothed, on her outsized Colonial fourposter bed.  She holds Offred’s hands, pulling them back awkwardly.  
Offred’s red skirt is hitched up to her waist.  No higher.  
            COMMANDER (V.O.) ...and she shall bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her. And she gave him Bilhah her Handmaid to wife, and Jacob went unto her. 
Below that, the Commander fucks Offred.  Methodically.  With monotonous exertion.
ON OFFRED.  Her back hitting against Serena Joy’s pubic bone.  Trying not to wince.  Her face blank.  
ON THE COMMANDER, pumping.  Dutifully.  He glances at Offred for a moment.  She avoids eye contact.
ON SERENA JOY.  Pained.  She grips Offred’s wrists tightly, digs her nails in. 
ON OFFRED -- What lesson is God teaching her?  
The Commander grunts softly. 
Serena Joy twists Offred’s wrists PAINFULLY, contorting her into a posture that looks like sadomasochistic bondage.  
Offred bites back a moan.  The Commander grunts loudly and COMES.  
Offred looks relieved. 
The Commander rests for a beat.  Then he steps back and pulls up his pants.  Neatens his clothes.  
He nods formally, then leaves.   
The door CLOSES.  
Offred is left entangled with Serena Joy.  They lay there for a beat, then Serena Joy roughly extracts herself and sits up.  She finds a cigarette, lights it. 
            SERENA JOY Get out. 
Offred hesitates, startled by her venom. 
            SERENA JOY (CONT’D) Are you deaf? 
OFFRED
(respectfully)
The chances are better if I lay on my back afterwards...
SERENA JOY
     (slow, fierce) Just get out.
Offred gets off the bed and leaves.  ON SERENA JOY for a miserable beat, then we -- 
CUT TO:
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER
Offred lies in her bed, awake.  Moonlight through the curtains makes patterns on her face.  
The grotesque horror of the ceremony replays in her mind.  She tries to settle her thoughts.  It’s not working. 
OFFRED (V.O.)
This is what I do when I’m back in my room.  
(and then)
I take off my clothes.  I want to wash, but it’s not allowed.  I put on my nightgown and get into bed.  I don’t sleep. I try not to smell them on me.  I try to think about something else. (and then)
The moon is the same.  That’s something.  They haven’t changed that.   
(and then)
I’ll think about the moon.  (and then, terribly) I can feel the Commander’s come running out of me. I can feel it on my legs. 
(MORE)

OFFRED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
     (and then, rising panic) I can smell it.  
Offred gets out of bed.  Driven by waves of claustrophobic panic, she heads out of the room. INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
Offred runs down the staircase.  She’s freaking out. EXT. WATERFORD HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Offred runs out the back door and into the yard.  A tall fence protects the garden.  
She stops on the grass, breathing hard, trying to calm down.  
She looks up at the moon.  Pale white.   
Suddenly, she feels someone watching.  She turns. 
NICK sits on the garage steps, outside his room.  He holds a worn paperback book.  He was reading in the cool night.    
Offred and Nick lock eyes.  
The moonlight shines through her nightgown.  Nick can see the silhouette of her body. 
Offred is frozen for a beat.  Then she turns and runs inside.  
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Offred comes in, reeling.  She sits on the bed, but her mind races. 
OFFRED (V.O.)
He’ll tell the Commander.  Will he wake him up, or wait for the morning?  How long do I have? But I didn’t do anything, not really. (and then)
That’s bullshit, I left my room, that’s enough. They don’t need a reason anyway.  A Commander can punish us any way he wants.  A belt, a steel cable.  He could shoot me in the fucking head.  I’ve heard the real creative ones like to tie our hands to the stove burners with wire.  (and then) Breeders don’t need their hands. 
As she fights panic...
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. RED CENTER - CAFETERIA - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Moonlight shines on the rows of cots. Handmaids-in-training sleep.
ON OFFRED, sleeping.  A far off MUMBLING wakes her.  She sits up, looks across the room.  
JANINE stands at the windows, naked.  Her eye is still bandaged.
Her red nightgown is tangled on the floor beside her.  She stares out, mumbling. Offred walks to her.   
JANINE
(mumbling)
Hello, can I help you?  
(and then)
Good morning, welcome...
            OFFRED Janine?
Janine’s mouth fixed is in a smile.  By now, other Handmaids are stirring.  Redheaded ALMA, steps up.  
ALMA
Put your clothes on, Janine.  Aunt Beth is on bedcheck.  I don’t want extra prayers on account of you.
JANINE
(scary friendly)
Hello, welcome.  Can I help you?
Moira steps up.
MOIRA
(to the other Handmaids)
Go to bed, don’t make this a thing.  
Most of the Handmaids head back to bed.
OFFRED
Janine, wake up.  You’re having a dream...
Janine looks at Offred.  But she isn’t talking to her.  She’s talking to an imagined world.
JANINE
Hello.  My name’s Janine.  I’m your server this morning.  Can I get you some coffee to start?
            MOIRA Oh, Christ.
            ALMA Don’t swear. 
MOIRA
Alma, go back to your Goddamn bed.
Alma slinks away.  
OFFRED
Snap out of it, Janine.  Come on. 
JANINE
(smiling)
You have a nice day, now.
Moira grabs Janine by her shoulders, then SLAPS HER HARD. 
MOIRA
You aren’t there anymore.  That’s all gone.  Now go back to your bed.
Janine touches her cheek, confused.
JANINE
What did you hit me for?  Wasn’t it good?  I can bring you another one.  
MOIRA
My name is Moira and this is the Red Center.  
JANINE
I don’t know any Moira.
MOIRA
Don’t you know what they’ll do?  
They’ll send you to the Colonies.  
You’ll be cleaning up toxic waste.  You’re skin will peel off in sheets and then you’ll die.  You’ll die, Janine.  
JANINE
(breaking)
I want to go home.  I want my mom.  
Janine starts to cry. Offred pushes the nightgown into her hands. 
OFFRED
(warmly)
Put on your clothes, Janine.  Get into bed. 
Janine nods.  She pulls on her nightgown.  Whimpering, she shuffles back to her cot. 
MOIRA
And shut up. 
(to Offred)
She does that again and I’m not around, slap her.  Hard, don’t be a fucking pussy about it.
            OFFRED Okay. 
MOIRA
That kind of stuff is contagious.  If we’re going to survive we need to keep our fucking shit together.  
They are all close to breaking.  Offred nods.
END FLASHBACK
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Offred paces, Moira’s words in her head. 
            OFFRED (V.O.) Pull your fucking shit together. 
Offred takes a breath, calms down a little.  
            OFFRED (V.O.) You’re alive.  That’s all that matters.  
     (and then) You’re alive.
TIME CUT TO:
EXT. WATERFORD HOUSE - MORNING
MORNING.  NICK polishes the Commander’s black car with a soft rag.  Tilting up, we see OFFRED watching from the bedroom window. 
            OFFRED (V.O.) That hasn’t changed.  The way men caress cars.  I still don’t get it.  
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Offred looks out the window, watching Nick. 
            OFFRED (V.O.) He saw me outside last night.  I know he did.  But the Eyes haven’t come for me. No black van.  No boots on the staircase.  Nothing.  Yet.   
In the distance, a BELL TOLLS.  THREE SLOW CHIMES.  Offred reacts --
OFFRED (V.O.)
Three bells.  A death knell. (and then)
They’re calling us.  There’s a 
Salvaging today.  (and then)
I am not safe, I know that.  Soon enough that bell could ring for me. (and then)
But not today.  (and then)
Okay.  As Moira would say, every day above ground is a good day.  And with some nice tequila, it’s a fucking great day.  
Offred heads out. 
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Offred enters.  Rita gets out the shopping basket and the food tokens.  She’s not happy.
OFFRED
Blessed day.
(and then)
I’ve been called...
RITA
(crabby)
Yeah, I heard.  Now I’ve got my work to do and your shopping.  Three bells and my whole day goes to the goose.  
            OFFRED I’m sorry. 
Nick enters.  Offred stops, surprised to see him.  He hesitates as well.  Offred decides to be bold. 
            OFFRED (CONT’D) Good morning.  
It is a suspiciously casual greeting, definitely a breach of the strict etiquette.  
Rita shoots a look, taking note. 
Nick considers -- then. 
NICK
Good morning. 
(to Rita)
Mrs. Waterford wanted you to remember to get oranges, if they still have any. 
RITA
(bitter)
Yes, Sir.  My pleasure. (and then)
Any other special requests?
Offred thinks, then...
OFFRED
They had tuna at Loaves and Fishes yesterday.  It looked good, you should get some.
Offred looks to Nick -- the tuna is an inside joke.  She knows he doesn’t like it. 
In this world of nuance and danger, she’s sending a message, asking a question -- We had a moment, remember? We’re friends, aren’t we?   
She’s trying to charm him.  It might keep her alive.
RITA
(yuck)
Oranges and tuna. Sounds delicious. (offhand) Under His eye.
                        OFFRED Under His eye. Rita leaves. 
Offred and Nick stand in silence.  Nick is cool, unreadable. 
After a long beat, NICK SMILES.  Detente.  Maybe Offred has bought herself a little safety, some good will.  
THE BELLS TOLL AGAIN.  THREE SLOW CHIMES. 
NICK
Blessed be the fruit. 
OFFRED
     (self-satisfied) Praised be. 
Offred leaves. PRELAP the sound of THE BELL, tolling again, slowly.  A steady chime now. 
EXT. THE WALL/THE COMMON - DAY
Inside the tower overlooking the Common, the bells RING.  In here, the sound is huge.  Medieval. 
DOWN BELOW, HANDMAIDS converge.  They move through an ornate set of GATES in the wall.  
In their cloaks, they make a red river, flowing onto the grassy field.  THEY ARE GATHERING FOR THE SALVAGING. 
            OFFRED (V.O.) To the tolling of the bells we walk, along paths once used by students, past buildings that were once lecture halls and dorms. (and then)
These buildings belong to the Eyes now.  No one ever goes in, not  willingly.  And no one ever comes out.
GUARDIANS line the path, herding the Handmaids.  Watching, listening.  
In the crowd, we find OFFRED.  She waits as the other Handmaids pass.  They exchange greetings. Praise be... Blessed... May the Lord open... 
OFFRED (V.O.)
This is a district Salvaging, for Handmaids only.  They don’t have them very often anymore.  There’s less need, we are all so wellbehaved. 
(and then)
I don’t want to be telling this story.  
OFGLEN steps up. 
OFGLEN
Blessed be the fruit.
OFFRED
May the Lord open. 
Paired, they join the others heading through the gates.
EXT. THE COMMON - CONTINUOUS
At the front of the lawn is a large STAGE, with microphones. 
Center stage is a FORKLIFT.  Two ROPES hang from the blades. 
With nooses.  This is a public execution. 
RED CUSHIONS sit in rows on the grass.  Handmaids come in, choose cushions, kneel. Guardians watch everyone.   
As Offred crosses the grass, she looks for a familiar face among the sea of Handmaids.  
            OFFRED (V.O.) When there are so many of us together, sometimes you can find someone you knew.  From before, or from the Red Center.  You can trade some news, if you’re careful.   
Offred spots someone, drifts over.  It’s redheaded ALMA, from the Red Center.  
OFFRED
Blessed be the fruit.
ALMA
     (with recognition) May the Lord open. 
Their are Guardians everywhere.  Alma only glances up.  They speak in very low whispers.  
ALMA (CONT’D)
     (whispers) Hey. 
OFFRED
(whispers)
Alma. Where are you posted?
ALMA
(whispers)
Commander Ellis.  He can’t barely get it up. Where’re you?
            OFFRED Waterford. 
ALMA
Fancypants.  Nice house I bet.  I saw Gabby a few months ago.  She had a miscarriage.  
A somber beat, mourning the lost pregnancy.  And then...
OFFRED
Have you seen Moira?  
ALMA
Not since the center.  
            OFFRED Me neither. 
A few feet away, a Handmaid turns around.  
IT IS JANINE -- we know her by the SCARRED LID AND EMPTY SOCKET where her right eye used to be.  She smiles, clearly a bit insane. 
JANINE
(brightly)
Oh, she’s dead.  
            ALMA Janine?
A nearby Guardian glares.
            GUARDIAN #4 Quiet!
They fall silent, look down meekly.
Across the Common, a procession of Aunts files onto the stage.  Behind them, Guardians in BLACK HOODS -- Salvagers -- escort two manacled HANDMAIDS. The prisoners stumble, drugged to keep them from struggling.
The Guardian moves off.  Offred leans close to Janine.  
OFFRED
(whispering)
Janine?  Who’s dead?
JANINE
(brightly)
Moira.  She hung herself.  
(and then)
(MORE)
            JANINE (CONT'D) She used the bedsheet.  They were blue.  Mine are white. 
OFFRED CAN’T BREATH.  MOIRA KILLED HERSELF? She has no time to process as -- AUNT LYDIA steps to the microphone.  
AUNT LYDIA
To you places, please.  Thank you.
Janine moves away, leaving Offred shaking.  Ofglen watches her -- always watching and listening. 
            AUNT LYDIA (CONT’D) Well.  Good afternoon girls.
HANDMAIDS
(in unison)
GOOD AFTERNOON, AUNT LYDIA...
Offred doesn’t respond.  She is still in shock.  
                        AUNT LYDIA Don’t you just love these Salvagings?  Who loves them? Dozens of hands shoot up automatically.  
            AUNT LYDIA (CONT’D) I hate them.  They are wasteful.  You girls are given so much.  You are so privileged.  And yet you are still so weak.  So wicked. 
(and then)
Wicked, like Ofscott...
Onstage, the Salvagers drag OFSCOTT forward, the first condemned Handmaid.  Ofscott can barely stand up by herself.
AUNT LYDIA (CONT’D)
The filthy wanton whore who lured a Guardian into breaking his pledge of abstinence.  Can you even stand to look at her, girls?
HANDMAIDS
(in unison)
NO, AUNT LYDIA. 
Offred doesn’t respond.  Ofglen shoots her a look.  There are Guardians everywhere, watching, looking for any disobedience. 
OFGLEN
     (low) Offred...
No good.  Offred is still lost, thinking of Moira. 
Onstage, OFRAY, a young Handmaid, is dragged forward.  
            AUNT LYDIA Wicked like Ofray. A girl disgusting enough to commit adultery with her Commander.  Under his own roof.  Where she was welcomed by his wife. 
Onstage, The Salvagers help the drowsy Handmaids up onto STEPSTOOLS.  Slide the nooses around their necks.  
            AUNT LYDIA (CONT’D) These disgusting creatures have given us no choice.  They asked for this, didn’t they girls? 
HANDMAIDS
(in unison)
YES, AUNT LYDIA...!
AUNT LYDIA
Yes they did.  And we are bound by 
Grace to oblige.  (off mike) Are we ready?
Aunt Lydia looks back to the Salvagers.  They put CANVAS 
HOODS OVER THE PRISONERS, then nod -- everything is ready. 
AUNT LYDIA (CONT’D)
(off mike)
Praise be. 
(to the crowd)
Are you ready girls?
HANDMAIDS
(in Unison)
YES AUNT LYDIA. 
            AUNT LYDIA Hands, please.
Moving together, all the Handmaids put one hand over their hearts.  Aunt Lydia does the same.
Ofglen nudges Offred.  Blankly, automatically, Offred puts her hand over her heart. 
AUNT LYDIA (CONT’D)
All together now.  (and then)
His will be done.
HANDMAIDS
     (in Unison) HIS WILL BE DONE.  
The Salvager KICK OUT THE STOOLS.  
Offred looks up as --
OFRAY and OFSCOTT fall and the ROPES GO TIGHT.  
NECKS SNAP.  
Muscles spasm.  Feet jerk.  A drool of URINE from Ofscott falls onto the stage.  
Offred, imagining Moira, goes pale. 
A CHEER rises.  Aunt Lydia raises her hand, and the Handmaids fall SILENT. 
AUNT LYDIA
Amen. 
(and then)
Now, some of you may have already heard that we have a special treat for you today.  Please stand up and form a circle.
She smiles down, munificent.  The Handmaids shove as they form a circle -- they’re excited, they know what’s coming.
            AUNT LYDIA (CONT’D) Orderly, girls.  You know the rules.
Offred comes out of her fog.
OFFRED
What’s happening?
            OFFRED (CONT’D) A Particicution.  
Two more Guardians appear, dragging a man.  He wears a torn Guardian uniform, his face bruised and bloodied.  
On OFFRED -- his beady eyes look familiar somehow. 
They drag him into the circle of Handmaids.  
AUNT LYDIA 
This man, once a Guardian in the army of Gilead, is convicted of rape.
(low moan from the crowd) (MORE)
            AUNT LYDIA  (CONT'D) The penalty for rape, as you know, is death.  But what’s worse, he raped a Handmaid.
     (whispers dramatically) She was pregnant.  And the baby died.
A wave of rage from the Handmaids.  
ON OFFRED -- she finally recognizes the Guardian.  We FLASHBACK TO:
EXT. MAINE WOODS - DAY - FLASHBACK
The Maine woods, from the opening.  OFFRED RUNS WITH HANNAH IN HER ARMS.
GUARDIANS descend on OFFRED, pulling away her screaming daughter.  The BEADY-EYED GUARDIAN swings his truncheon, hitting OFFRED.  She falls.
            BEADY-EYED GUARDIAN Bitch...
Looking up, she sees his face.  
FLASHBACK ENDS:
EXT. COMMON - DAY
THE GUARDIAN IN THE CIRCLE IS THE SAME BEADY-EYED GUARDIAN FROM THE WOODS.
Offred BOILS WITH FURY, READY TO POUNCE.  Ofglen pulls her back.  Other Handmaids are ready to charge as well. 
Aunt Lydia looks out, proudly. 
AUNT LYDIA
Not until I give the signal.  When I blow the whistle, what you do is up to you.  Until I blow it again.  Are you ready?
Aunt Lydia raises her whistle to her lips.  
The Guards release the prisoner’s arms.  
The Beady-eyed Guardian staggers, falls to his knees. Sputters unintelligibly.  
CLOSE ON Aunt Lydia’s lips, closing around the whistle.  
SHE BLOWS THE WHISTLE -- A SHRILL, HIGH-PITCHED TONE -OFFRED SCREAMS and attacks. All around her, the crowd surges.  A tide of rage and red.  
Offred is the first to get to the beady-eyed prisoner.  He looks up.  Offred kicks him viciously.  Then again. He crumples backwards.  She STOMPS ON HIM --   
FROM ABOVE, OFFRED VANISHES IN THE RED THRONG as the Handmaids descend on the prisoner.  
The prisoner disappears beneath the red cloaks.  We see and hear FLASHES -- blood, fists, screaming, choking.  
UP ON THE STAGE, Aunt Lydia raises her whistle to her lips and starts blowing.  As the SOUND ECHOES -- 
Ofglen finds Offred, pulls her back.   
OFGLEN
Are you all right?
No answer.  Offred looks down to see A CLUMP OF HAIR IN HER HAND.  Janine emerges from the crowd.  
Blood smears her face.  She smiles.
            JANINE Have a nice day.
Janine starts to walk away.  Offred calls after her -- she might know more about Moira.
OFFRED
Janine.
     (and then, louder) Janine!
This is DANGEROUS -- even using Janine’s name is dangerous.  The murmuring crowd camouflages her voice, but a few nearby GUARDIANS turn.  
Offred starts to follow Janine.  Ofglen grabs Offred’s arm, pulls her away.  
OFGLEN
     (low) No.
Offred is shaking, unhinged as Ofglen leads her away.
They pass the spot of the Particicution.  A WHITE SHEET now covers the remains of the dead Guardian.  Blood seeps through the sheet. 
On Offred -- What did I do?
OFGLEN (CONT’D)
     (low) Walk.  
Offred obeys, following Ofglen from the Common. 
EXT. GILEAD STREETS - DAY
Handmaids leave the Salvaging.  They split into pairs and head in different directions.  
Ofglen leads Offred by her arm.  The sidewalks are emptier now -- most of the Handmaids have peeled off in other directions. 
Ofglen walks with her head down.  Speaks in low, secret whispers as they walk. 
OFGLEN
     (whispers) I’m so sorry about your friend.  Moira?
Offred nods.  She is still shaken from everything that’s happened, but she recognizes that Ofglen is breaking rules here.  This is dangerous talk. 
OFGLEN (CONT’D)
(whispers)
You knew her from the Red Center?
Offred nods, and then...
            OFFRED And before.
A beat...
OFGLEN
Was there ever a before?
Ofglen gives Offred a thin smile. A moment of connection.  Trust, almost. But should she trust Ofglen?
Ofglen nods towards a storefront across the street.  The sign is just a pictograph -- Bees and a round loaf -- Bread and Honey. 
OFGLEN (CONT’D)
That used to be an ice cream place.   
OFFRED
I remember.  
OFGLEN
They had this amazing salted caramel.  
(and then)
That stuff was better than sex.
Offred reacts to this blasphemy, surprised. 
OFFRED
I always thought... (and then)
You were always such a true believer. 
OFGLEN
So were you.  So stinking pious.  (and then)
They do that really well.  Make us distrust each other.  
A BLACK VAN PASSES, SLOWLY.  The windows are tinted.  On the side is painted a simple but terrifying image.  
AN EYE, with two angel wings.  The secret police are on the prowl.
Offred watches it go past.  Terrified. 
            OFFRED Eyes. 
OFGLEN
Come on.  Just keep walking. 
They head off in silence.  Offred looks back as the van follows for a block, then peels off.
TIME CUT TO:
EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
Offred and Ofglen walk towards home.  It’s quiet, only a few people on the streets.  
They look down, speak in low voices.  
OFGLEN
            How old is your daughter? Offred reacts, surprised.   
OFGLEN (CONT’D)
(off her look)
When you saw the girls outside the church....

Ofglen has been watching.  Taking note. 
OFFRED
She would be six.  Hannah. 
This is the first time we have heard her name. Ofglen smiles.
            OFGLEN Pretty name.
OFFRED
She’s the only thing keeping me from stepping in front of a car.
OFGLEN
(I get it)
My wife and I had a son.  Oliver.  He’s almost ten by now. 
OFFRED
Do you know where they are?
OFGLEN
Montreal.  She had family there, they had Canadian passports. (and then)
I didn’t.  I got caught at the airport. 
OFFRED
We were trying to cross in Maine.  
With my husband.  We split up. (and then)
They killed him. (and then)
His name was Luke. 
Now he has a name.  You can hear the guilt in her voice. 
OFGLEN
If you were together, they would’ve done the same thing.  They didn’t want him, and they weren’t going to let any of us get away.  Not if you had a red tag. 
OFFRED
I know. 
(and then)
When I left him, I didn’t even look back.  
This clearly tortures Offred.  Ofglen has nothing to say, no solace to offer.  
EXT. WATERFORD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
They stop in front of the Waterford House.  
OFGLEN
This is your stop.  As they used to say. 
     (and then) I’m Emily. 
Offred hesitates -- after keeping herself secret for so long, saying her own name feels wrong. 
OFFRED
June.  I’m June. 
JUNE.  IT IS THE FIRST TIME THE AUDIENCE HAS HEARD HER NAME.   
Has Offred found a friend?  Someone she can trust? 
OFGLEN
Nice to meet you, June. 
Ofglen leans close.  
OFGLEN (CONT’D)
(very low)
Listen to me.  They’re watching.  
There’s an Eye in the house. (and then) Be careful. 
Offred REACTS -- someone in the house is an Eye?  
And how in the world could Ofglen know this?  Is she helping Offred, or is this some kind of trap?
Her mind races. 
TWO GUARDIANS walk towards them.  Ofglen steps back, bows her head.  The image of a docile Handmaid. 
OFGLEN (CONT’D)
(to Offred)
Blessed be the fruit.
Ofglen walks away, leaving Offred stunned.  She turns and looks up at the WATERFORD HOUSE.  
A beautiful tableaux -- this woman in red, in front of this stately, dangerous house.  
IN VOICE-OVER, we hear OFFRED. 
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
OFFRED (V.O.)
(calm)
A chair.  A table.  A lamp.   
INT. WATERFORD HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
Offred sits in her red cloak, looking out of the window.  
It is the image from the start of the episode.  
That otherworldly tableaux.  A woman draped in red, in this dollhouse-perfect bedroom. 
JUNE (V.O.)
I sit and watch the curtains move in the breeze. (and then)
Nothing can change.  Someone is watching.  It all has to look the same.  
(and then)
Because I intend to survive. I intend to survive for her. (and then)
Her name is Hannah.  My husband was 
Luke.  
(and then)
My name is June. (and then)
Some things can’t be wiped away.  Some things can’t be forbidden. 
OFFRED looks out the window.  Still.  Seemingly docile.  But there is a new defiance in her eyes.

          OFFRED Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...
          DOCTOR Waterford's probably sterile.
Most of those guys are.
If Waterford can't get you pregnant, they won't blame him.
It'll be your fault.
I can help you.
It's too dangerous.
          OFFRED He tried to connect.
That's what he needs.
It has been so hard.
Being alone in that room.
I'm afraid I'm starting to give up.
That would be a tragedy.
The accused stand charged with gender treachery, in violation of Romans.
I know this is a shock for you, Emily.
Things will be easier for you now. You won't want what you cannot have.
fսck!
          NICK Look, I'm sorry this is happening to you.
You can't change anything about this. It's gonna end the same no matter what you do, so there's no point trying to be tough or brave.
Everybody breaks.
Everybody.
WATERFORD
( Sighs ) Very nice.
Thank you.
Not even close. You ran away with that one.
I got lucky.
Maybe you're just learning my weaknesses.
Maybe.


And I like it when he lets me win.
We're a match made in heaven.
It reminds me of a poem I read once. "You fit into me like a hook into an eye a fish hook an open eye"
( Drawer closing ) I have a present for you.
Those were all destroyed.
Some of us retain an appreciation for the old things.
I thought you might like to read it.
It's not allowed.
It is with me.
          OFFRED I used to buy magazines like this at the airport.
I read them when I got my hair highlighted.
Now the models all look insane.
Like zoo animals.
Unaware they're about to go extinct.
"Ten ways to tell how he feels about you. Number one, he brings you small gifts." Check.
Good surprise?
Yes, thank you.
( Chuckles ) That look on your face is thanks enough.
( Laughing )
( Pop music playing )
No.
What?
Oh, God, no.
You're too picky.
June, what?
Come on, man. This one has on a fedora.
( Laughs ) You kidding?
Beggars, choosers.
What?
Shut up and show me your profile pic.
Okay.
You better not have on a fedora.
( Both laugh ) Hold on. No, no fedora.
Good! We can probably do better than this.
What do you mean?
I'm just sayin'.
That's a nice photo!
Watch this. Hey. Um, ooh. Hi.
Hi. You look heterosexual.
          JUNE Hey.
( Chuckling )
          MOIRA Um, sorry.
Quick question. Um, are you on Tinder?
My friend's on Tinder.
You on Tinder?
No, I'm...
No? Okay. Look, she is attracting a lot of chumps.
Okay.
          MOIRA And I personally...
What?
I'm going to kill you in your sleep. I think it's because of her profile pic, and I just wanted to get an objective male opinion.
Sorry.
Right, okay.
Ah...
Yeah. It's nice.
Yeah, it's nice.
Nice, that's just...
Nice is chump bait.
What's wrong with nice?
No, no, no, no!
You have to help me find something better than this.
No. No, he doesn't.
Relax, I'm not going to show him your nudies.
Seriously?
No, there are no... It's fine.
Sorry.
You gonna...
Hey, I mean, don't look at me.
I'm just waiting for my hot dog, you know. But I'm happy to help out.
I'm gonna help you out with that. No problem.
( Both laugh ) I'm just... Let's see what we can find.
Who are those?
Uh, Lucy and Ethel.
They're my cats.
Cute.
Thank you.
Yeah. There's a lot of good options.
Yeah?
He's very thorough.
( Laughs ) That one.
Which one?
Uh-oh.
This one.
No.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, look wait.
Why?
No, that's a very interesting choice.
Yeah, because you look...
You look invincible.
          MAN Two hotdogs, extra onion.
Oh, that's... that's me.
All right.
Thanks so much. Sorry about that.
No, my pleasure. All right. Bye.
          JUNE Have a good one.
Bye, cutie. ( Laughs ) He's cute. Really cute.
So cute.
He's married.
He does not act married.
No, they never do.
( Laughs ) Thank you.
Blessed day.
( Slurps )
          RITA Don't you have somewhere to be?
No.
Must be nice.
( Tap water running )
          OFFRED Ten ways to tell how he feels about you.
Number two.
He keeps finding ways to accidentally run into you.
Number three.
What was number three?
Offred? Can you help me outside for a bit?
Yes, Mrs. Waterford.
          OFFRED She found out about Scrabble.
Or she found the writing in the closet.
Or maybe it's the magazine?
Any way you slice it, I lose a hand.
          SERENA JOY Okay, now, that's enough mulch.
Too much and the plant will rot.
( Sighs ) Okay. That's better.
          OFFRED Maybe she's just keeping me occupied until the black van arrives.
There are things I could do.
How hard would I have to press those shears into her neck before seeing blood?
Nothing yet?
No. Nothing.
Well, that's bad luck.
Your time is running out here.
You don't want to be sent to the Colonies, do you?
( Bushes rustling )
( Exhales )
Maybe he can't.
( Wind whooshing ) ( Whispering ) The Commander.
I was thinking maybe we could try another way.
I'm sorry. I don't understand what you mean.
( Inhales ) I mean, with another man.
It's... It's forbidden.
Officially, yes. But women do it all the time.
I'm sure you've heard the stories.
I've heard rumors about...
Doctors.
Yes.
Some women do it that way.
But it should be with somebody we trust.
( Inhales sharply ) I was thinking of Nick.
Nick?
Yeah. He's already agreed.
Nick is loyal, and he's been with us for a very long time.
What about the Commander?
Forget about the Commander.
All right.
All right.
Good.
Good.
( Sighs )
We'll do it this afternoon after the shopping.
May as well strike while the iron is hot.
Will you bring that in for me?
Yes, Mrs. Waterford.
( Somber music playing )
( Music playing over speakers )
( Indistinct announcement over PA system )
          JANINE You know, she's even started smiling now?
Oh, it's so cute.
And she sticks out her tongue sometimes like this.
Ah.
You really shouldn't talk about that stuff, Ofwarren.
Hater.
Under His eye.
Always blessed.
Did you see?
          ALMA She's back. ( Indistinct announcement over PA system )
          OFFRED Blessed be the fruit.
May the Lord open.
          OFFRED Ofglen.
Ofsteven.
( Sighs )
Right.
It's so good to see you.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
We were worried.
I'm fine.
The Eyes took you?
Nick, our driver, is he one of them?
Is there anything that you can tell me?
I don't know.
But you said there was an Eye in the house.
I don't know anything anymore.
After what happened, I'm too dangerous to be part of it.
Part of what?
Mayday.
Mayday? What is Mayday?
Offred?
There you are.
Hiding out in the vegetables.
( Bird cawing )
( Indistinct radio chatter ) Don't do that again.
What do you mean?
I mean Ofsteven.
I'm not going to let you mess this up for me.
This isn't messed up?
You're cute.
You used to do yoga classes... Spinning or something... Before?
And your man liked to cook?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You guys had a first floor walk-up, down Back Bay, with a garden.
Had yourself a Nordstrom's card, right?
I liked Anthropologie. Yeah?
I used to get fսckеd behind a dumpster just so I could buy a sixth of Oxy and a Happy Meal.
I'm clean now.
I've got a safe place to sleep every night and I have people who are nice to me.
Yeah. They're nice.
All right.
And I want to keep it that way.
Whatever they did to Ofsteven, that's not gonna happen to me. Understand?
Mmm-hmm.
( Indistinct radio chatter )
( Footsteps approaching )
Ready?
Yes, Mrs. Waterford.
( Dog barking in the distance )
          OFFRED I should calm down.
Barring the possibility of violent arrest, it's nothing I haven't done before.
So how come this time it feels like I'm cheating on Luke?
          LUKE Winter is so late this year.
          JUNE What are you talking about? It's cold.
Yeah, but it hasn't even snowed yet.
They say it may not at all this year.
Well, that's depressing.
When I was in college, I used to go to the English department to study.
And there was a fireplace, and it was warm.
I was all by myself.
That sounds safe. Flammable material...
( Laughs ) It was magical.
Yeah. It was very romantic by myself.
Mmm-hmm.
( Clicks tongue and inhales )
So, uh, in college, did you and Moira ever...
Did we ever what?
You know, did you ever...
What, do you think all girls just go through a gay phase?
No, look, it's just you two are very close and you're both very attractive and, in my experience, these things sometimes happen. Your experience as a lesbian?
All right, forget it.
Or your experience as a college girl?
I retract the question, okay?
( Laughing ) No! No, for the record.
I actually haven't even told Moira that we've been having lunch and hanging out.
I don't know why. I just...
I feel like she'd be... Weird about it.
Hmm.
( Clicks tongue )
Yeah, I don't tell Annie either.
Really?
What do you say?
I just... I just tell her I had lunch at my desk.
( Chuckles ) I mean, it's just... It's so dumb.
We're not even doing anything.
Exactly, that's why I'm just, like, we're having lunch in broad daylight.
Yes.
With four adorable children.
Children watching, right?
( Both laugh ) Where would we even go, you know?
Uh, where would we go?
We couldn't go to my place. Moira's there, working.
What do people in the movies do?
( Laughs ) In the movies?
They get a room.
Yes.
Yeah, they get a room.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, we could get a room.
( Chuckling )
Some, like, um...
Dirty... ( Laughs )
( Laughing ) Pay-by-the-hour...
Right.
Place.
Yeah.
Gross.
No. No, it could be fun. They'd have one of those vibrating beds.
( Laughs ) Think about it.
We could go to the Hyatt.
Hmm.
Yeah.
One of those, you know, higher rooms with a view of the city at night.
So, how would it work? I'd just...
Come surprise you after work, or...
No. No, never.
No surprises. I need 48 hours.
Right. Time to get a restraining order.
Yes, file the papers.
Right.
( Laughs ) Yeah.
No, I mean, I need to... Personal grooming and...
Um...
Pick out some lingerie.
What, you know what you'd wear?
I have ideas.
It's not gonna happen, though.
No.
No.
No. ( Breathing deeply )
( Exhales )
( Knocking on door ) Hello, Nick.
          NICK Hi.
( Dog braking outside )
So, uh, do we pray first?
No. There's no time.
Please.
( Floorboard creaking )
( Dramatic music playing )
( Metal clanking )
( Sighs )
( Clears throat ) You want to see what's on TV?
No, that's...
No?
Do you?
No...
( Clicks tongue ) I'm good.
Are you sure?

Yeah.

Yeah?
I like to be on top, okay?
Ah, that's not really... That's not good for me.
That's not good? Oh, that's a bummer.
All right. I'll try it. I'll try it once.

You don't just feel pregnant 30 seconds after a man cums.

          WATERFORD This is a surprise.
Care for a drink?
A game?
          OFFRED Don't you ever do that again.
Do what?
Touch me like that, when she's there.
I didn't mind it.
I don't think you did either.
What if she saw you?
She could have me sent to the Colonies or worse and you know that.
I understand.
I'm sorry, all right?
Okay.
          WATERFORD I just find the whole thing so impersonal.
( Glass clinking ) You think?
You sure you wouldn't care for a drink?
No, thank you.
All right.
How about a read? No. You miss this?
Lists of made-up problems.
No woman was ever rich enough, young enough, pretty enough, good enough. ( Chuckles ) We had choices then.
Now you have respect.
You have protection.
You can fulfill your biological destinies in peace.
( Page turns ) Biological destiny?
Children. What else is there to live for?
Love.
Love?
Yes.
( Chuckles ) Love isn't real.
It was...
Never anything more than lust with a good marketing campaign.
Maybe for you but not for me.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Remember Ofglen who used to live next door?
Ofglen had urges that led her to do unnatural things.
I'm sure, to her, it felt like love.
In cases such as these, the punishment is death.
But, out of respect for her position, we let her live.
We're not without compassion.
What did you do to her?
We helped her. We saved her.
We had a doctor take care of the problem.
It's such a small problem, truth be told.
Every love story is a tragedy if you wait long enough.
( Breathing shakily ) I should go.
Suit yourself.
We only wanted to make the world better.

Come on, this way. Your mistress might like them. Hi. I know what they did to you.
I'm so sorry.
Ofglen.
I'm not Ofglen.
I know. Just, it's hard to keep track.
          OFGLEN 2 Offred, you should come see the lilies.
Yes, of course.
Mayday can't use me anymore.
But you can help them.
Who are they?
They're fighting back.
Find them.

They can't do what needs to be done.

There was a way we looked at each other at the Red Center.
For a long time I couldn't figure out what it was exactly.
That expression in their eyes.
In my eyes.
Because before, in real life, you didn't ever see it.
Not more than a glimpse.

And, in any case, you know the law.
Yes, I do.

I remember.
She's a smart girl.
I imagine that she's pretty good at this.
We'll talk about this another time.
She left makeup on the collar of my cloak.
Is that how you got her past the checkpoints?
You need to keep your hands off of her.
I will not have her hanging from a ceiling or stepping in front of a truck.
Do you understand me, Fred?
You're going to control yourself.
Control myself.
You brought lust and temptation back into this house.
On your back, and on your knees.
If I've sinned, then you led me to it.
You can blame me all you want, but He knows the truth.
Everybody answers to God.
And you answer to me.
Go to your room.

Don't get upset.
That's not good for the baby. No!
Furthermore, I, Warren Putnam, did knowingly engage in the sin of lust and covetousness.
And by doing so, I rent the sacred covenant that exists between myself and my country, my brothers, and God Almighty.
I offer myself humbly to His judgment, as spoken through this council.
Body and soul shall I give to thee.
Thank you, Commander Putnam.
Go in grace.
Under His eye.
          PRYCE Thoughts, gentlemen?
He seems genuinely remorseful.
And he's a strong defender of the faith.
Shall we have a voice vote?
Commander, this is a serious offense.
Of course.
But who amongst us hasn't made mistakes?
And who amongst us doesn't have an afternoon of work piling up as we sit here?
Commander Waterford, we're all very busy men.
But are we too busy to stand against sin?
Of course not.
Good.
Then we should discuss next steps.
And we should remember Commander Putnam has a family, a wife and a new child.
Yes. She came to me herself to testify for her husband.
Yes, what we decide here will affect innocent people.
She came to ask for the harshest possible punishment.
She fears for his immortal soul.
She knows that he must make an offering to God to find redemption.
She loves her husband...
