[woman gasps] 
5 
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,322 
[female voice] First thing you'll learn is that nothing is what it seems. 
6 
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,415 Ignore your assumptions. 
7 
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,792 Don't trust anything. 
8 
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,423 What you see, what you hear, 
9 
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,511 what people tell you, 
what you think you remember... 
10 
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,896 
[soft gasps] 
11 
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,487

[soft island music playing] 
 
14 
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,874 
[female voice, whispering] We are Envoys, and we take what is offered.

[man sighs and grunts] 
 
18 
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,597 
[female voice] 
Let experience wash over you. 
 
19 
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,684 Absorb it like a sponge. 
 
20 
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,437 Expect nothing. 
 
21 
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,816 
Only then can you be prepared for anything.

  26

00:04:54,669 > 00:04:59,674
[in English] Fucking bone fragments. 
Always get goddamn splinters. 
 
27 
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,343 Who do you think they are? 
 
                28 00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,928 
Who cares? We're getting paid. 
 
                29 00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,014 
Have you always been such an asshole? 
 
30 
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,017 Every sleeve, every time. 
 
31 
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,954 
[voices whispering indistinctly] 
 
32 
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,005 What? 
 
                33 00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,383 
CTAC praetorians, 12. Lethal loads. 
 
                34 00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,760 
You see through the walls now? 
 
35 
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,889 Three seconds or less. Move! 
 
36 
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,206 
[whirs and clicks] 
 
37 
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,501 
[female voice] 
Your body is not who you are. 
 
38 
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,545 
[hisses] 
  39 00:06:22,090 > 00:06:24,675
You shed it like a snake sheds its skin. 
 
                40 00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,679 
Leave it, forgotten, behind you. 
 
41 
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,809 
[man] The only way you'll learn is by watching, so watch. 
 
                42 00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,519 
Didn't cover this in the basic briefing. 
 
                43 00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,229 [man] You'll be fine. 
 
                44 00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,356 
They can barely walk at first. 
Have to pull him out. 
 
45 
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,983 
[woman] 
I'm gonna get this shit all over me. 
 
46 
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,860 
[man] You'll get used to it. 
Just decant him. 
 
47 
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,695 
We've got four more to do in the next hour. 
 
48 
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,742 I think I'm gonna be sick. 
 
49 
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,245 
Not until you learn how to take out the umbilicus, you aren't. 
 
                50 00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,373 
Like this. Just give it a good hard jerk. 
  51 00:06:58,167 > 00:06:59,085
[man grunting] 
 
                52 00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,045 
What the fuck? Is that normal? 
 
53 
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,632 
[man] Sometimes they flop around. Usually 
means their last sleeve died violently. 
 
54 
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,346 
-[alarm blaring nearby] 
-[woman grunts] 
 
55 
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,765 
[both gasping] 
 
56 
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,021 
[both panting] 
 
57 
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,953 
[panting] 
 
58 
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,768 
[female voice whispers, echoing] Make it personal. 
 
                59 00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,645 
It is you. You are the weapon. 
 
                60 00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,190 
You are the killer and the destroyer. 
 
                61 00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,902 
It is you. You are the weapon. 
 
                62 00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,279 
You are the killer and destroyer. 
 
63 
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,032 
[panting] 
 

64 
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,368 
[long exhale] 
 
65 
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,959 
[man groans] 
 
66 
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,287 -[woman grunts and yells] -[man] Get down! 
 
67 
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,123 
[beeping] 
 
                  68 00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,550 -[woman] This can't be normal. 
-He'll be fine. Just get him in the chair. 
 
                  69 00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,095 -[woman] You get him in the chair. 
-[man] All right, buddy, enough of that. 
 
70 
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,472 
-[man grunts] 
-[woman gasps] 
 
71 
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,891 
 -[grunting] -[man] Shit! 
 
72 
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,269 We need help. Help! Help! 
 
                73 00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,021 
-You broke my goddamn nose. 
-[woman] Help! We need help. 
 
                74 00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,235 
[man] Fucking rerun went mental on me. 
 
75 
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,320 [man 2] Have to sedate you if you don't settle down. 
 
76 
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,364 
-I am fucking bleeding here! -Shut up! 
 
                77 00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,158 
Listen, asshole. You better calm down. 
 
78 
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,786 
[grunting] 
 
                79 00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,584 
How long? How long have I been down? 
 
                80 00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,090 
-Who the hell is this guy? 
-How fucking long? 
 
81 
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,633 
[gasping] 
 
                82 00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,553 
[woman] Two hundred and fifty years. 
 
83 
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,640 
-[choking] 
-[mumbling] Get me a mirror. 
 
84 
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,143 
No mirrors here. You need time to adjust to your new sleeve. 
 
                85 00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,020 
You risk schism or a psychotic break. 
 
                86 00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,896 
He's already fucking psychotic! 
 
87 
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,565 Get me a fucking mirror! 
 
88 
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,368 
[muffled screaming] 
 
                89 00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,545 
You almost fucking killed me, man. 
 
90 
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,881 [groans] I hate getting shot. 
 
91 
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,342 [inhales deeply] Where am I? 
 
92 
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,011 Alcatraz Prison. Bay City. 
 
93 
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,554 What planet, genius? 
 
94 
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,513 Earth. 
 
95 
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,482 Which way's the shower? 
 
96 
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,168 
[female voice] 
One thing I can promise you: 
 
97 
     00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,047 coming back from the dead is a bitch. 
 
98 
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,802 Every single time. 
 
99 
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,804 [woman] Welcome to Alcatraz. 
 
100 
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,223 
You've successfully completed your prison sentence. 
 
101 
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,268 
You may notice you are no longer in the body you arrived in. 
 
102 
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,688 
Now that you have paid your debt to society, 
 
103 
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,025 you have been resleeved 
from our available inventory of prisoners. 
 
                104 00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,694 
You may feel confused or strange. 
 
105 
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,406 
    [female voice] After all, you're not supposed to be here. 
 
106 
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,868 
       [woman] Disorientation, visual and auditory hallucinations, 
 
107 
     00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,080 and even low-grade amnesia are normal. 
 
108 
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:50,042 
 But don't worry. This orientation will answer all of your questions. 
 
109 
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,920 This is a cortical stack. 
 
110 
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,797 
As Protectorate citizens, 
 
111 
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,426 we each have one implanted 
when we are one year old. 
 
112 
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:04,723 
Inside is pure human mind, 
coded and stored as DHF: 
 
113 
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,392 Digital Human Freight. 
 
114 
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,230 
Your consciousness can be downloaded into any stack, in any sleeve. 
 
115 
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:17,069 
  You can even needlecast in minutes to a sleeve anywhere in the Settled Worlds. 
 
116 
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,113 A sleeve is replaceable. 
 
                117 00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,324 
But if your stack is destroyed, you die. 
 
                118 00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,910 
There's no coming back from real death. 
 
                119 00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,287 
[guard] Warden wants to see you. 
 
120 
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,373 
So, avoid blunt force trauma to the base of the brain 
 
121 
     00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,792 and energy weapons fired at the head. 
 
122 
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,676 
[woman groans] 
 
123 
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,553 
[man grunting] 
 
124 
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,512 
[woman yells] 
 
125 
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,099 
-[Kovacs shouts] 
-[both grunting] 
 
126 
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,527 
[groans] 
 
127 
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,071 
-[both grunting] 
-[woman groaning] 
 
128 
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,500 
[yells] 
 
129 
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,088 
[groans] 
 
130 
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,928 
 [female voice] When you wake up, the world will not be what it was. 
 
131 
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,764 And neither will you. 
 
                132 00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,976 
They have forgotten who and what we are. 
 
133 
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,522 Make them remember. 
 
134 
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,190 Put that out. 
 
135 
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,781 You... 
 
                136 00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,409 
File's incomplete, parts of it sealed. 
 
137 
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,328 What is here? 
 
138 
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,290 
  Espionage, terrorism, crimes against the state, 
 
139 
   00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,459 and more murders than I can count. 
 
                140 00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,627 [man] Takeshi Kovacs. 
 
141 
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,797 
You're under arrest for treason against the Protectorate. 
 
142 
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,634 
[panting] 
 
143 
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,970 
Working for the terrorist leader Quellcrist Falconer. 
 
144 
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,263 
[chuckles] 
 
145 
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,184 
I didn't work for her. 
It was more like an autonomous collective. 
 
146 
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,562 
[in German] 
Close your goddamn mouth, you traitor, 
 
147 
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,605 or I'll put a hole 
right through your head. 
 
                148 00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,898 [in Japanese] You moron. 
 
                149 00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,235 
[in English] Good to see you too, Jaeger. 
Been a while. 
 
                150 00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,570 
[Jaeger in German] Chase is over. 
 
151 
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,448 Just give me an excuse. 
 
152 
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,160 
 [in English] I know you got orders not to make me into a martyr, so... 
 
153 
     00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,205 be a good little grunt and take me in. 
 
154 
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,082 
  [man] Sleeve's fragged but the stack's okay, sir. 
 
155 
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,212 [in German] Who's the bitch? 
 
                156 00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,132 
[in English] Nobody. Just a local merc. 
 
                157 00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,426 
She doesn't even know who I am. 
 
                158 00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,391 
You should've been respectful to me. 
She would've lived. 
 
159 
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,477 [warden] And when they finally arrested you, 
 
160 
  00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,771 you gunned down your own partner in the stack. 
 
161 
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,733 
Report says she was shot from behind, so... 
 
162 
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,194 along with everything else, you're a coward. 
 
                163 00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,908 
Don't you have anything to say? 
 
164 
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,413 Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, 
I was waiting for a question. 
 
165 
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,834 
It was all monologue there for a while, so I kind of tuned out. 
 
166 
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,006 
This is your parole document, 
 
167 
    00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,677 certifying that your DHF was shipped 
from Millsport Maximum Security Prison, 
 
168 
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,681 received here intact, 
and sleeved in this body, 
 
169 
      00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,102 which came equipped with military-grade 
neurachem and combat muscle memory. 
 
170 
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,314 You've been provided with clothing and incidentals 
 
171 
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,108 as per the specifications 
of Bancroft Industries, 
 
172 
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,153 which has leased you. 
 
173 
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,406 
As such, you are the property of Laurens Bancroft 
 
174 
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,783 
for the duration of that lease. 
 
                175 00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,993 
Property? What about my rights? 
 
176 
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,328 You don't have any. 
 
177 
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,122 
       Failure to comply with the terms of this parole 
 
178 
       00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,999 will result in your immediate desleeving 
 
179 
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,168 and return here, 
 
180 
    00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:07,925 to serve out the rest of your term, 
which does not appear to have an end date. 
 
181 
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,259 You're going to screw up. 
 
182 
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,471 
    Do something violent, hurt someone, kill someone. 
 
183 
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,723 I know people like you. 
 
                184 00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,892 
There aren't any people like me. 
 
185 
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,812 Not anymore. 
 
186 
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:26,360 
[female voice] There will be places where they'll wait. The people left behind. 
 
187 
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,739 
[man talking indistinctly over PA] 
 
188 
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,913 
[female voice] 
Wait to see their friends, lovers, 
 
189 
    00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,332 parents, children come back to them, 
 
190 
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,044 riding unfamiliar bodies 
out from digitized exile. 
 
191 
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,964 
They'll look into the eyes of strangers, 
 
192 
     00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,216 searching for a glimpse of the person they've lost. 
 
                193 00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,051 
-Mommy? 
-[gasps] 
 
                194 00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,387 [woman] Cindy? 
 
195 
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,596 Kristin Ortega. 
 
196 
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,765 
    I'll be driving you to the Bancroft residence. 
 
                197 00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,103 
-Welcome to Bay City. 
-[man] Hey, hey, hey! 
 
                198 00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,939 
What have you done to our daughter? 
Cindy's seven years old! 
 
                199 00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,649 
You get whatever's in inventory. 
 
                200 00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,445 She was murdered in a hit-and-run. 
The law says she gets a free sleeve. 
 
                201 00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,696 [guard] That one's free. 
 
202 
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,324 
If you don't like it, pay for an upgrade or put her back in storage. 
 
203 
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,661 
[crying] Daddy, please don't put me back in the dark. 
 
                204 00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,873 
They put a kid in that old lady? 
 
205 
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,750 Victim restitution. 
 
206 
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,918 The state just gives you what they have on hand. 
 
207 
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,462 Broken down crap like that. 
 
208 
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,506 
Prisons lease out the good sleeves for profit. 
 
209 
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,341 It's very humane. 
 
210 
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,801 You don't approve? 
 
                   211 00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,263 -They don't have that where I come from. 
-[Ortega] And where would that be? 
 
                   212 00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,557 
-[crowd] Yeah! 
-[Kovacs] What's going on here? 
 
213 
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,975 You are all going to burn! 
 
                214 00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:40,934 [all] Yeah! 
 
                215 00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,853 
[chanting] Let the dead speak! 
 
216 
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,440 
Justice! Let the dead speak! 
Justice! Let the dead speak! 
 
217 
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,234 -Justice! Let the dead speak! 
-[overlapping chant] No resleeving! 
 
218 
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,362 
Shouldn't have come back! 
Shouldn't have come back! 
 
219 
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,031 
[shouts overlapping] 
 
220 
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,367 
Justice! Let the dead speak! 
Justice! Let the dead speak! 
 
221 
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,662 No resleeving! No resleeving! 
No resleeving! 
 
222 
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,039 You will not be forgiven. 
 
                223 00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,248 [Ortega] Come on. Let's go. 
 
224 
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,669 
God is watching. 
He will judge you for your sins! 
 
225 
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,505 Gonna keep him busy a while. 
 
                226 00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,559 
[Ortega] Spirit Savers and Afterlifers. 
 
227 
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,687 
              653 failed, and still they can't stop yelling. 
 
                228 00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,231 [Kovacs] What is 653? 
 
229 
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:31,360 
Something about spinning up murder victims to testify who killed them. 
 
230 
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,446 
       Why wouldn't you spin them up if they're witnesses to their own murder? 
 
231 
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,116 
               Archdiocese says you only get the sleeve you're born with. 
 
232 
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,576 
             Once it dies, they spin you back up for anything, 
 
233 
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,330 
even to identify your killer,
your soul goes to hell. 
 
234 
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,998 What do you think, huh? 
 
235 
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,876 
I think no one in the archdiocese has ever been murdered. 
 
236 
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,216 
[sighs heavily] 
 
237 
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,844 You had to go be a dick. 
 
238 
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,014 
      -[grunts] -Stay down, Kovacs. 
 
239 
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,599 Fuck you! 
 
240 
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,144 
[grunting] 
 
241 
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,571 
[panting and grunting] 
 
242 
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,119 I said stay the fuck down. 
 
243 
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,288 
[yelling] 
 
244 
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,889 
[indistinct advertising chatter outside] 
 
245 
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,486 What were you in for? 
 
246 
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,572
                  You know, little bit of this, little bit of that. 
 
                247 00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,449 
Blew some shit up and killed some people. 
 
                248 00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,911 
Some people just need killing. 
 
                249 00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,996 
And how do you decide who deserves to die? 
 
250 
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,167 
Depends on the day. 
I mean, anything can set me off. 
 
251 
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,046 
Interstellar dictatorship, genocide, people who talk too much. 
 
252 
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,381 
[sighs] 
 
253 
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,968 
Right now, I'm feeling pretty hostile towards Laurens Bancroft, 
 
                254 00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,346 
-whoever the fuck he is. 
-[Ortega] Oh, come on. 
 
255 
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,847 Everyone knows Bancroft. 
 
                     256 00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,600 -He's one of the first founding Meths. 
-What's a Meth? 
 
257 
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,393 You don't know what's a Meth? 
 
258 
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,356
[chuckles] How can you not know? 
You're dressed like one. 
 
259 
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,983 
[Kovacs] Like I said, 
I'm not from around here. 
 
260 
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,905 
"And the days of Methuselah were 969 years." 
 
261 
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,662 
It's Laurens Bancroft. 
He's over 360 years old. 
 
262 
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,288 
[whooshing] 
 
                263 00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,129 
[Ortega] They call it the Aerium. 
 
264 
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,351 
    Guess they don't have this where you come from either, huh? 
 
265 
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:22,239 
So, where were you born? 
Like, home planet, that kind of thing? 
 
266 
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,615 Not here. 
 
267 
   00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,451 -That's a little vague. [chuckles] -You ask a lot of questions. 
 
268 
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,829 
That's my abuela. She always said, 
 
269 
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,164 
"Kristin, you can find a way to talk to anybody." 
 
270 
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,834 
Especially when they're trapped in a car with you. 
 
271 
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,339 
[Ortega] Our quick and messy little lives are so small to them. 
 
272 
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,341 
They build their homes up here 
 
273 
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,303 
so the clutter of our existence is out of their sight. 
 
274 
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,515 
[alarm beeping] 
 
275 
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,642 -[muttering indistinctly] -See those trees, right? 
 
276 
 00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,312 -I see them. Whoo! [muttering] -Right there. 
 
277 
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,688 You see the ground? 
 
278 
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,481 It's right there. 
 
                279 00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,698 
Wow. Really stuck that landing. 
You're not a driver, are you? 
 
280 
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,992 
I said I worked security. 
I didn't say for who. 
 
281 
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,661 
So this hasn't been a conversation, it's been an interrogation. 
 
                282 00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,663 
Last chance. Just give me a name. 
 
283 
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,459 Takeshi Kovacs. Look me up. 
 
284 
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,046 
[beeps] 
 
                285 00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,390 
You can't be who you say you are. 
All the Envoys died. 
 
286 
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,641 All except one. 
 
                287 00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,770 
-Not another step, Ortega. 
-Oh, come on. 
 
                288 00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,480 
I'm Bay City PD and you know it, Curtis. 
 
289 
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,356 
        Lower your weapons and tell me where your boss is, 
 
290 
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,484 because I really would like a fucking word. 
 
291 
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:44,279 
Lieutenant Ortega. 
You're trespassing on private property. 
 
292 
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,366 Apparently, you've stolen one of our limos as well. 
 
293 
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,409 I could have you shot. 
 
294 
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,953 Yeah, go ahead. Try. 
 
295 
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,163 
[siren blares] 
 
296 
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,425 
Why did you drive the Envoy? 
Isaac was supposed to do that. 
 
297 
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:10,055 
[Isaac grunts] Look, I'm not drunk, okay? 
I was just loosening up a little. 
 
298 
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,556 Let go of me! 
 
299 
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,600 We picked him up on a DUI. 
 
300 
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,852 
  [Ortega] Which is how we came into possession of your vehicle. 
 
                301 00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,896 
You all right? This is unacceptable. 
 
302 
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,564 Just stop it, all right, Mom? 
 
                303 00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,900 
It's your fault for sending me. 
I'm not a chauffeur. 
 
                304 00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,153 
Go inside. This is police harassment. 
 
305 
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:30,075 
Yeah, there's your kid, there's your car, and there's your... new pet terrorist. 
 
306 
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,034 You're welcome. 
 
307 
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,370 
The terrorist can hear you. 
I'm standing right here. 
 
308 
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,289 
Yeah, good, 'cause we're not done, you and me. 
 
309 
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,503 
[chuckles] 
 
                 310 00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,800 Forgive me. I'm Miriam Bancroft. 
We've not been properly introduced. 
 
311 
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,553 Welcome to Suntouch House. 
 
312 
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,639 
[police car whooshing] 
 
313 
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,066 
[soft ethereal chiming] 
 
                314 00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,361 
[Kovacs] Shouldn't that be in a museum? 
 
315 
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,574 
          I have a weakness for Elder civilization artifacts. 
 
                316 00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,870 
I collect them, among other things. 
 
317 
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,331 
This must have cost a fortune to ship here. 
 
                318 00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,624 [Miriam] Hmm. 
 
319 
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,960 Several fortunes, actually. 
 
320 
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,879 And a few lifetimes. 
 
321 
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,673 But cost was no object. 
 
                322 00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,260 
This is the only Songspire tree on Earth. 
 
                323 00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,388 
No one really knows what they are. 
 
324 
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,601 
 They could have functioned as part of Elder civilization architecture. 
 
325 
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,147 
The largest ones ever recorded are thousands of meters high. 
 
326 
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:48,236 I know. I've seen them. 
 
327 
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,705 Stronghold, of course. 
 
328 
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,459 Laurens is in his study. 
 
329 
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,669 I'll show you up. 
 
330 
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,633 
[elevator whirring] 
 
331 
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,558 
Is it true you can look into a person's eyes 
 
332 
      00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,685 and know exactly what they're thinking? 
 
333 
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,314 Hmm, Envoys don't read minds. 
 
334 
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,691 What a pity. 
 
335 
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,736 
[elevator dings] 
 
336 
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,446 Good luck, Mr. Kovacs. 
 
                337 00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,461 [man] Mr. Kovacs. 
 
338 
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,799 
My apologies my son failed to drive you here. 
 
339 
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:56,179 
        You have to forgive my endlessly misplaced optimism. 
 
340 
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,309 
That's all right. 
The ride was very instructive. 
 
341 
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,521 Hmm. Yes, I'm sure it was. 
 
342 
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:09,651 
  Details are, after all, an Envoy's stock-in-trade.  343 
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,861 Or were, I should say. 
 
344 
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,533 
"Immersion and total absorb." Wasn't that the term, hmm? 
 
345 
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,536 
"Whatever answer you may seek, 
 
346 
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,039 it is precisely 
where you are not looking." 
 
                347 00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,917 
-Hmm, you've read Falconer. -Ah. 
 
                348 00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,461 
I was alive during the Uprising, yeah. 
 
349 
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,256 Yeah? So was I. 
 
                350 00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,926 
Oh. [stutters] Yes, my apologies. Uh... 
 
351 
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,387 
It's all in the distant past for me, 
 
352 
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,890 but for you, of course, 
it's all rather different. 
 
                353 00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,394 
There are very few of us now... 
 
354 
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:50,567 who saw firsthand 
what the Envoys could do. Ah-ha. Yes. 
 
355 
    00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,280 [stutters] And I have to admit that 
I had a grudging admiration for you. 
 
356 
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,781 
Trained by Quell herself 
 
357 
       00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,618 to be the most formidable fighting force that the galaxy had ever seen. 
 
358 
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,496 
Well, that would sound better if we hadn't lost. 
 
                359 00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,500 
This might... might interest you. 
 
                360 00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,464 
Oh, it's all corneal streaming now. 
 
361 
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:16,968 
  There's something about the simplicity of holding the written word in your hand. 
 
                362 00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,846 
-The very heft of it. 
-[female voice whispering] 
 
363 
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,059 
             As men have done for countless of centuries before us. 
 
                364 00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,312 
It is a tie to our shared past. 
 
                365 00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,482 
-Where did you get this? 
-I bought it at auction. 
 
366 
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,359 Eh, supposedly it...  
367 
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,152 
[female voice] 
Envoys take what is offered. 
 
                368 00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,322 
...is written by Falconer in her own hand. 
 
369 
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:43,870 
Judging by your reaction, it appears I might have got what I paid for. 
 
                370 00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,455 [Kovacs] Listen to me. 
 
371 
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:49,584 
        I spent this entire morning being well and truly fucked around with, 
 
372 
   00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:53,171 so, uh, let me be painfully clear. 
 
373 
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,843 Some things can't be bought. 
 
374 
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,638 Like me. 
 
375 
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,642 
       Now, I didn't ask you to bring me back into this world. 
 
376 
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,645 
          In fact, I fought a war to stop people like you from happening. 
 
377 
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:13,441 
So, if someone doesn't tell me right now what the fuck this is all about... 
 
378 
  00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,861 I might very well lose my temper.  379 
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,452 Hmm. 
 
380 
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,206 Understood. 
 
381 
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,624 Now... 
 
382 
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,293 this is a full pardon, 
 
383 
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,963 signed by the president 
of the Protectorate. 
 
                384 00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,758 
No one has that kind of power. 
 
385 
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,596 
Power is a matter of influence, Mr. Kovacs. 
 
386 
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,726 
And I have had a great deal of influence at the UN. 
 
387 
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,645 
If you agree to my terms, 
 
                388 00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:55,316 your sentence will be reduced to time served. 
 
389 
00:28:55,775 --> 00:29:00,071 
And then I will open up a very generous line of credit in your name. 
 
390 
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,532 DNA trace accessible. 
 
391 
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,117 
When the investigation is over, 
 
392 
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,830 you may keep this sleeve 
or choose another. 
 
393 
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,583 To your own specifications. 
 
394 
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:15,170 
Finally, I will pay you a salary 
 
395 
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,339 of 50 million UN credits. 
 
396 
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,468 That's a fortune. 
 
397 
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,095 Have any future you want. 
 
398 
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:25,847 Now... 
 
399 
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,351 all I ask of you... 
 
400 
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,480 is that you solve a murder. 
 
401 
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:34,981 Whose? 
 
402 
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,404 Mine. 
 
403 
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,117 
[indistinct radio chatter] 
 
404 
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,827 [man] Stop obsessing. 
 
405 
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,498 
So he was a soldier. 
So he's still just another rerun. 
 
                406 00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,042 
No, an Envoy wasn't just a soldier. 
 
407 
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:58,171 
Drop into any sleeve on any planet and be combat-ready in minutes. 
 
408 
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,548 Just read it. Read it. 
 
409 
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,845 
"Absorb local language, culture and customs, 
 
410 
    00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,931 and pass in almost any environment." 
 
411 
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:12,268 
"Infiltrate and manipulate computers, systems, other people." 
 
412 
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,603 Kovacs is a ticking bomb! 
 
                413 00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,981 
-[in Arabic] Ortega, calm down. 
-[in Spanish] I'm fucking calm. 
 
414 
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:18,942 
[groans] 
 
415 
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:26,115 
[in English] Okay. Bancroft resleeved a terrorist into our city. Why? 
 
416 
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,408 
Um... 
 
417 
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,037 
Hired muscle? 
Uh, expensive toy? I don't know. 
 
418 
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,082 
    Maybe he's planning to invade another star system over the weekend 
 
419 
   00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,708 like a Meth version of laser ball. 
 
420 
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,293 Who the fuck knows? 
 
                421 00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:41,297 [in Arabic] You made me swear. 
Listen. You need to take up meditation. 
 
422 
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,383 
[in Spanish] 
This is a good time to meditate? 
 
                423 00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,468 [in English] Look, Kristin. 
 
                424 00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,639 
-Okay. 
-No. Listen to me. It's wrong! 
 
425 
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,140 I know. 
 
426 
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:56,145 
           Whoever he is, there's nothing to be afraid of. 
 
                427 00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,856 
-Afraid? -No. 
 
428

00:30:57,939 > 00:30:59,983 Who's afraid? I'm not. 
What are you talking about? 
 
429 
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,861 
Okay, look, what I meant is... [sighs] 
 
                430 00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,071 
Kovacs is gonna go back on ice. 
 
                431 00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:08,908 
Where he belongs. End of story. 
 
432 
  00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,378 [Bancroft] This is where I died. 
 
                433 00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,298 
When Miriam found me, my head... 
 
                434 00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,842 
[scoffs] ...had been vaporized. 
 
                435 00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,386 
[Kovacs] It's an energy weapon? 
 
436 
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,347 Yes. A particle blaster. 
 
437 
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,895 
I keep one for personal protection in a biometric safe 
 
438 
  00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,939 that only Miriam and I can open. 
 
439 
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,150 Go ahead, say it. 
 
440 
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,235 Everyone else has. 
 
441
00:31:45,612 > 00:31:49,908 
Either I committed suicide, or my wife murdered me. 
 
442 
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,953 
        But you're still here, meaning your stack is intact, so... 
 
443 
  00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,497 you must remember what happened. 
 
                    444 00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:00,251 I'm afraid it's completely destroyed. 
"RD'ed," as they say. 
 
445 
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,377 
Then how-- 
 
446 
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:06,591 
Have you ever heard of full-spectrum DHF remote storage backup? 
 
447 
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,634 Yeah. 
 
448 
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,179 
Just never met anyone filthy rich enough to afford it. 
 
449 
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,264 Well... 
 
450 
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,059 I need to show you something. 
 
451 
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,064 
Sometimes I come up here 
 
                452 00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:25,568 when I have decisions to make 
or difficulties to face. 
 
453
00:32:25,652 > 00:32:27,862
Think about the ancient explorers, 
 
454 
    00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,531 back when one could spend a lifetime 
 
455 
       00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,452 pursuing the possibilities of the Earth, the oceans, the stars. 
 
456 
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,705 [sighs] I was born in London. 
 
457 
    00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:42,502 When I first moved to what was then, of course, called the United States, 
 
458 
  00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:48,383 it still had the faintest echoes 
of the new and brash culture 
 
459 
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,093 that it once was. 
 
460 
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,427 Oh.  
                461 00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,973 
The age of adventurers is over. 
 
462 
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,433 
[device whirring] 
 
                463 00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,231 
Well, take a look. Tell me what you see. 
 
                464 00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,656 
It's a Protectorate satellite. 
Military grade. 
 
465 
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,449
Hmm. It is military grade, 

 
466 
  00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,660 but it's not the Protectorate's, it's mine. 
 
467 
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,037 
Every 48 hours, 
 
468 
    00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,708 my stack is automatically needlecast to it. 
 
469 
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,085 
       So your current self has no memory of what happened? 
 
470 
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,461 
No, whoever killed me 
 
471 
 00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,631 pulled the trigger ten minutes before my backup went through. 
 
472 
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,883 
    Means all your memories from those 48 hours are gone. 
 
473 
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:31,801 Completely. 
 
474 
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,556 
There was an attempted hack on my satellite feed 
 
475 
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,058 moments after my death. 
 
476 
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,394 Somebody wants me dead. 
 
477 
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,941
For all I know, 
you did try to kill yourself. 
 
                478 00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,569 
-You just botched the job. 
-[sighs] 
 
479

Mr. Kovacs, I am not the kind of man who would take his own life. 
 
480 
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,160 And even if I were... 
 
481 
        00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,497 I'd not have bungled it in such a fashion. 
 
482 
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:06,127 If I had meant to die, 
I would indeed be dead. 
 
483

[chuckles softly] 
 
                484 00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,176 
I don't want your money or your pardon. 
 
                485 00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,636 
I'll take eternity on ice, thanks. 
 
                486 00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,805 
You should take the day, Mr. Kovacs. 
 
487 
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,476 
          Go into the city, remember what it is to feel alive, 
 
                488 00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,562 and then give me your answer. 
 
489

497 
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,577 I should be asking you that.

You don't like him, though.

     He wanted me reprimanded when I couldn't find his killer.

Since she can't be resleeved, she was actually murdered.

 00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,251 the body keeps making hormones. Did you know that? 
 
599 
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,461 Yeah. Everyone knows that. 
 
600 
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:49,340 
      You know that first time, when you're fresh out of the tank-- 
 
601 
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,674 Shut the fuck up. 
 
602 
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,843 
I'm thinking since you took me out for a drink-- 
 
603 
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,721 
You're paying, and one more time, you're just an asshole. 
 
                    604 00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,224 -Not the first date to call me that. 
-Also, not a date. 
 
605 
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,900 
You know what my Envoy Intuition's telling me right now? 
 
                606 00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,363 
Without question or reservation? 
 
607 
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,031 What? 
 
                608 00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,244 
Bancroft believed he was murdered. 
 
609 
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,167 
Which made it a lot more fun when I turned him down. 
 
610 
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,460 You what? 
611
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,339
 See, psycho-terrorists, we're not so easy to predict as you'd think. 
 
                   612 00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,633 -So you're going back into storage? -Yeah. 
 
613 
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,176 This isn't my world. 
 
                614 00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,054 
-Oh. 
-[beeps] 
 
615 
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,515 
I'm gonna be at the Raven on Coronado Street 
 
616 
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,767 if you change your mind. 
You should change your mind. 
 
                     617 00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,186 -You know that's one of the AI hotels. -Mmm-hmm. 
 
618 
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,521 No one stays in them anymore. 
 
619 
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,817 
Well, I got money and he's got girls, so I think we'll be good. 
 
620 
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,194 
[stutters] They're hardwired to want guests. 
 
621 
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,738 
        If you stay with one, it's like sleeping with a stalker.  622 
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:59,368 
    Hey, I'm moved by your concern but I'm gonna get myself a nice meal, 
 
623 
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,995 couple of high-end hookers 
 
624 
  00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,415 with a little better appreciation 
for the stamina of the newly resleeved, 
 
625 
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,251 and enjoy what's left of my little vacation 
 
626 
        00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:12,339 before I go back to sleep forever. Cheers. 
 
627

-[door opens] 
 
                629 00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,156 
[man] Felicitations. 
You have arrived at the Raven, 
 
630 
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:40,784 
Bay City's most deliciously macabre lodging experience. 
 
631 
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,746 Fully cabled and enabled. 
 
632 
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,042 
How can I ease your journey through this world? 
 
                633 00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,211 
Ah, a room. The best everything. 
634
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,882
  Food, view, entertainment, private kind of entertainment. 
 
635 
00:43:54,965 --> 00:44:00,512 
        A much-needed respite from the trials of bleak existence. 
 
636 
   00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:06,226 The Raven offers VIP access to the 
Houses of selective sexual tastes. Hmm? 
 
637 
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:11,190 
       The Temple of Eros affords an oasis of indulgence in the Mojave. 
 
                638 00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,109 
[gasps] Rock stars in Angels City. 
 
                639 00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:20,157 
And let us not forget our own... 
satellite of sin, 
 
640 
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,450 Head in the Clouds. 
 
641 
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:25,829 
       No fantasy beyond reach for the client of discerning means. 
 
642 
 00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,790 Well, I'm not that discerning. 
 
643 
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,125 
[both chuckle] 
 
644 
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:35,005 
       From the sky above, there is always the mud below. 
 
645 
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,674 
I could guide you. 
 
646 
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,841 No. 
 
647 
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,260 
          For some elemental and fast satisfaction in Licktown. 
 
648 
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,764 
That won't be necessary. 
Just, uh, have someone sent to my room. 
 
649 
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,767 
Oh, the Raven can supply your chambers with companions 
 
                   650 00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,186 -and accessories for any decadence. -Good. 
 
651 
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,230 
Perchance you could tell me your preferences? 
 
                652 00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,732 
-Right now? Nonverbal. 
-Mmm-hmm. 
 
653 
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,444 
[gasps] I know one particular lady of the night who seems a demure clerical worker 
 
654 
       00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:02,408 but carries in her briefcase instruments 
of such delight it will tickle your bones. 
 
655 
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,409 I'll take it. 
 
656 
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,161
And how might you intend to pay for your stay? 657 00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,621
DNA trace. Bank of the Nation. 
 
658 
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,623 
[man, Russian accent] 
He won't be needing a room. 
 
659 
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,586 
So much for Envoy Intuition. 
Voodoo bullshit. 
 
660 
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,839 
         Pardon me, wayfarer, we're in the midst of conversation. 
 
                661 00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:21,301 
Shut up, you piece of digibrain shit. 
My microwave is smarter than you. 
 
                662 00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,345 
I just want one thing to go right today. 
 
663 
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,596 Clearly. 
 
664 
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,973 Too bad. 
 
                665 00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,808 [in Russian] Turn around. 
 
                666 00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,898 
[in English] They said you'd be dangerous. 
I thought you'd be bigger. 
 
                667 00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,775 
They made me bring all this backup. 
 
668 
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,944
What a waste of my time. I don't need them. 
669
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,028 Fuck you, Dimi. 
 
670 
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,701 Anyone else? 
 
                671 00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,329 
[sighs] I have to clean that up. 
 
672 
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,914 What? 
 
                673 00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,542 
Uh, he had it coming. He was rude. 
 
674 
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:03,469 
    I could take you myself without even breaking a sweat. 
 
675 
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,638 Move. 
 
676 
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,517 
     Good sir, I cannot assume host prerogatives without payment. 
 
677 
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,271 
-You want to get him a hot towel? 
-[man echoes] Host prerogatives. 
 
678 
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,732 
[man] You're some kind of moron staying in an AI hotel. 
 
                679 00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:21,653 
Possessive like a crazy girlfriend. 
No one stays in them anymore. 
 
680 
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,947 -Really? I hadn't heard that.

684 
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,626 Just one thing. 
 
                685 00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,961 
[Ortega] They're hardwired to want guests. 
 
                686 00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,965 
[Dimi] Possessive like a crazy girlfriend.

[female voice whispers indistinctly] 
 
                688 00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,307 
Touch the screen within 50 seconds. 
 
689 
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,726 You, shut up. You, get up.

[Kovacs grunts] 
 
691 
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,941 
                It's not voodoo, which, by the way, absolutely is bullshit. 
 
692 
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,067 Here he comes. 
 
693 
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:03,487
It's a form of 
subliminal pattern recognition.

You know. It's... It's about the details.

                699 00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,084 [Dimi] Fight, God damn it! 
 
700 
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,504 
What, you lost your balls? 
Did something change while you were down? 
 
                701 00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,005 
-Nothing changed. -Ten...

729 
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,130 
What happened to a meal, getting laid, and restacking forever? 
 
730 
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,590 
I got interrupted. 
 
731 
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,387 Who the fuck are these guys? 
 
                732 00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,473 
I don't know. But they knew me. 
 
                733 00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,642 
They called you by name? You're sure? 
 
734 
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,478 Kristin. Four of them are just local muscle, 
 
735 
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:45,065 but this sleeve 
is registered to Dimitri Kadmin. 
 
736 
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,526 Ulan Bator registry. 
 
                737 00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:49,986 
-We got him. -Yeah. 
 
738 
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,154 Got who? 
 
739 
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:56,159 
       Dimitri Kadmin, hit man out of Vladivostok. 
 
                740 00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,203 
Otherwise known as Dimi the Twin. 
 
                741 00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,580 
Does a lot of work for the yakuza. 
 
742 
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,833 Dimitri doesn't trust anyone.  743 
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,127 
So, he makes an illegal copy of himself, 
 
744 
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,379 and downloads it 
into a black market sleeve. 
 
745 
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,048 It's called double-sleeving. 
 
746 
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,510 The penalty is real death. 
 
747 
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:16,138 
We hold onto his stack, sooner or later, 
 
748 
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,931 we catch the other version of him out there, 
 
749 
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,641 and then, he's done.

-[in Spanish] Shit. 
-[partner in English] What?

00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,150 It's fragged.

           ...not enough left to spin him up to interrogate. Fuck. 
 
                758 00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,536 
[Ortega] You couldn't just disable them? 
 
759 
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,789 
    I was coming to the defense of my first guest in five decades. 
 
760 
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,167 
[Ortega] With enough firepower to bring down an airplane.

    I'm fully licensed for customer protection. 
 
762 
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,882 
           And in any case, his attackers were remarkably rude. 
 
                763 00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,176

-[stammers] 
 
                764 00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,261 -What does that have to do with anything? -Okay. 
 
                765 00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,888 
So, Dimitri's a high-end hit man? 
 
766 
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,055 Yeah. Top of the line. 
 
767 
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,892 
Well, then Bancroft's death wasn't a suicide. 
 
768 
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,059 Of course. 
 
769 
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,854 
    Because who would want to kill an asshole like you? 
 
                     770 00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:09,983 Plenty of people. A few centuries ago. 
See, I don't merit this kind of hit 
 
771 
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,986 unless you want to stop me 
from looking into Bancroft's death.

[Ortega] Less than eight hours out of the tank, 
 
                774 00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,246 and you're up to your eyes in 
organic damage and real death.

-Then do what you were born to do.

It's the unanswered question.

       [Kovacs] When everyone lies, telling the truth isn't just rebellion. 
 
3 
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,208 It's an act of revolution. 
 
4 
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:49,466 
So think carefully when you speak it, because the truth is a weapon. 
 
5 
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,925 So how'd she die? 
 
6 
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,431 Did she fall? Jump?

But when the cops went to spin her up, they found out she was coded Neo-C. 
 
16 
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,549 Maybe she kept it secret. 
 
                17 00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,676

I don't handle religious conversions.

But you didn't do a religious conversion. 
 
23 
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,158 You faked her code. 
 
24 
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,702 
You can't fake religious coding on a stack.

    There's no witness on Mary Lou's conversion, 
 
32 
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,773 no personal statement, 
no four levels of fucking protocol.

That's domestic systems jurisdiction.

ever got close to jumping planets. 
 
40 
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,433 
   The reason why he has no answers is because what you are talking about 
 
41 
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,560 is not real. 
 
42 
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,563 There's no conspiracy.

00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,995 I know. 
 
                  54 00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,042 
I'm wearing your fucking boyfriend? 
 
                  55 00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,711 -You didn't think to mention that? 
-I have trust issues. 
 
56 
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,964 Yeah? With me or him? 
 
57 
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,008 
With you. You don't find a killer, you go back on ice. 
 
                58 00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,178 
-Little conflict of interest there. 
-Bancroft sleeves me in a crooked cop. 
 
59 
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,305 
Might as well have "shoot me" branded on my forehead. 
 
60 
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,557 And you don't say anything because you want me to fail 
 
61 
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,227 
-so you can get Ryker back. 
-Ryker wasn't crooked. 
 
                62 00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,188 
[in Spanish] In case you hadn't realized. 
When are you gonna get it? 
 
                63 00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,773 
[in English] Bancroft wasn't murdered. 
 
64 
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:37,068 
So you've been following me to make sure this sleeve doesn't get damaged 
 
65 
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,195 because you knew 
people wanted to damage it. 
 
66 
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,990 
     You ever think some of them might be gunning for me, not Ryker? 
 
                67 00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,866 
I followed you because you're a terrorist. 
 
                68 00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,952 
Dimi 1 came after me at the Raven. 
 
69 
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,621 
Ever wonder why he was here? 
Why he knew my real name? 
 
70 
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,250 Then we got Dimi the Second, Mr. Disembodied. 
 
71 
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,920 
     Works me over in virtual, only he doesn't know my real name. 
 
                72 00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,880 
Just sees the skin, calls me Ryker. 
 
73 
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,465 But here's the best part. 
 
74 
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,594 
       He thinks that Ryker killed his so-called brother, Dimi the First. 
 
75 
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,639 -Now why would he think that? 
-Just get to the point. 
 
76 
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,351 
Because Dimi the Second framed Ryker for the murder of a CTAC. 
 
77 
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,397 
       Dimi's a real fucking talker when he's chopping your body parts off. 
 
78 
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,149 Dimi the Twin framed Ryker? 
 
79 
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,777 Ryker's conspiracy, 
Bancroft's murder, they're connected. 
 
80 
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,695 How? 
 
81 
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,406 Fuckin' ask him. 
 
82 
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,206 I want to go in and see her. 
 
                83 00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,626 
-Lizzie's getting better. 
-No thanks to you. 
 
                84 00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,588 
-This is not your decision. 
-Oh, it most certainly is. 
 
85 
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,466 
        You empowered me to make medical decisions for Miss Elizabeth. 
 
                86 00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,134 
That is what I'm talking about. 
 
87 
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,178 
No one's ever called her Elizabeth in her life. 
 
88

[elevator dings] 
 
                89 00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,143 
-Kovacs. 
-[Kovacs] Not now. 
 
90 
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,521 
   I need to talk to you about Lizzie and this megalomaniac you call a hotel. 
 
91 
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,231 I don't have time for this. 
 
                92 00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,736 
I told you before, we're not friends. 
I don't owe you a goddamn thing. 
 
93 
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,363 
I'm chasing down my fucking leads to get what I need. 
 
94 
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,576 
Which, in case anyone is interested, is my freedom. 
 
                95 00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,205 
-If I may... 
-Did I fucking stutter?  96 
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,290 
No, your speech was quite clear, 
 
                    97 00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,876 -if a trifle laden with obscenities. 
-That's not what he meant. 
 
98 
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,505 
Don't talk to me again unless you have something useful to say, okay? 
 
99 
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:24,217

[sighs] 
 
101 
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,569 
That is a piece of rare, antique linen that... 
 
102 
 00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,242 you obviously are going to have dry-cleaned? 
 
103 
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,161 Professionally! 
 
104 
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,998

[soft ethereal chiming] 
 
                106 00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,015 
[Curtis] Hey, Kovacs. 
How'd you get in here? 
 
107 
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,853 
The guards'll be fine. Well, except for the broken jaw and shattered leg. 
 
108 
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,272 
     Yeah, well, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Hey! 
 
109 
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,607 
 -[groans and gasps] -[Miriam] Takeshi... 
 
110 
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,734 stop damaging the help. 
 
111 
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,820 
[Curtis gasping] 
 
                112 00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,915 
-Where is he? 
-[classical piano music plays softly] 
 
                113 00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,419 
-Can I get you a drink? 
-I asked you a question. 
 
114 
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:48,092 
Laurens has gone to the Old City to minister to the masses. 
 
                115 00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,429 
I could get you a car if you'd like. 
 
                116 00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,142 
Or you could stay a while. With me. 
 
                117 00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,190 
Did you like what we did together? 
 
118 
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,192 Seems like a long time ago. 
 
119 
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,986 It was night before last.  
                120 00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:12,366 
Well, I've been in virtual for a while. 
Busy screaming and dying. 
 
121 
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,910 Because of the case? 
 
122 
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,288 
 Not a lot of other reasons for people to wanna kill me. 
 
123 
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,790 Takeshi-san, listen to me. 
 
124 
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,585 I want you to drop the case. 
 
                125 00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,379 
I'll double whatever he's offering you. 
 
126 
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,799 
 Buy you a new identity anywhere in the Protectorate. A new life. 
 
127 
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,801 He'll never find you. 
 
128 
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,723 
 My husband dragged you here and he locked you into a deal 
 
129 
  00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,350 you had no choice but to accept. 
 
                130 00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,061 
Do you really think he'll set you free? 
 
131 
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:44,565 
That's what the lease says. 
I expect him to honor it. 
 
132 
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,026 Mmm. Honor. 
 
                133 00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,655 
He threw you into a fight pit. 
 
134 
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:57,203 
No. When you learn the truth, the only possible truth, 
 
135 
  00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,122 that Laurens pulled the trigger, that he was weak and he gave up, 
 
136 
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,042 he's a coward, 
he won't forgive you for that. 
 
137 
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,172 
Your freedom, that thing you want so much, 
 
138 
  00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,550 he'll make sure you never see it. 
 
                139 00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,474 
You have no idea what he's capable of. 
 
140 
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,726 You're terrified. 
 
                141 00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,647 
He will want someone to punish. 
 
                142 00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,860 
And my family means everything to me. 
 
143 
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:36,409 
Laurens will not allow what he loves to grow and change. 
 
144 
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:42,164 
Our children, he's trapped them in kind of a benevolent dependence forever. 
 
145 
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,668 
And when a Meth says "forever," it isn't hyperbole. 
 
146 
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,421 
So you're afraid of what he'll do to all of you. 
 
                147 00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,256 
I don't believe in punishment. 
 
148 
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,759 I believe in reward. 
 
149 
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,349 
I have an island. It's mine. 
Not even Laurens knows about it. 
 
150 
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:05,605 
Built a complex there, with a clone tank, resleeving facilities... 
 
151 
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,068 
Sometimes I decant the clones and let them play. 
 
152 
       00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,494 Do you understand what I'm offering you? 
 
153 
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,792 Imagine more of me. 
 
154 
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,172 
A pack of bodies, 
 
155 
 00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:36,344 orchestrated by the same mind, 
with a singular focus. 
 
156 
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,181 
You. 
 
157 
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,308 I'm multi-sleeved. 
 
                158 00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,727 
[Kovacs] That could get you erased. 
 
                159 00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,105 
[Miriam] Mmm. Uncountable, my sins. 
 
160 
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,734 And you can have all of me, for as long as you'd like. 
 
                161 00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,321 
And when you're finished, your freedom. 
 
                162 00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,158 
I'm not here to save you, Miriam. 
 
163 
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,373 
   I believe I'm the one offering to do the saving. 
 
164 
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,208 Think about it. 
 
165 
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,752 
But don't take too long. 
We're running out of time.

00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,158 I didn't send for you. 
 
201 
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,661 You put me in this body just to punish Ortega. 
 
                202 00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:54,208 
Go wait for me by the truck, little ones. 
Go on. Run along. 
 
203 
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,503 
 Keep your hands covered or risk getting infected. 
 
                204 00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,300 
You needed an effective sleeve. 
 
                205 00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,387 
She needed to be taught some respect. 
 
206 
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,430 Two birds, one stone. 
 
                    207 00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:13,227 [Kovacs] Petty move. Wasted my time. 
Childish for someone your age, isn't it? 
 
208 
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,648 
What could you possibly know about my age, Kovacs? 
 
209 
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,568 
        Good point. I'd have chosen a younger sleeve. Something more virile. 
 
210 
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,319 Oh. Yes. 
 
211 
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,154 No doubt. 
 
212 
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:30,369 
    But then a young man sees himself as a fighting and fucking machine, huh? 
 
213 
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:36,542 
But the truth is, it's at this age that a man achieves real respect, 
 
                214 00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:42,423 for he has battled many times 
and clearly triumphed. 
 
215 
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,216 Who... 
 
216 
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,970 
Who are the most potent gods after all, huh? 
 
                217 00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,556 
-[man] Thank you. -Odin. 
 
218 
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,684 Jupiter. Zeus. 
 
                219 00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,771 
A colossus is rarely a young man. 
 
                220 00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,984 
He is father. With many children. 
 
221 
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,284 You're infected. 
 
222 
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:15,122 
Well, no one from the outside world will touch them. 
 
223 
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:20,878 
  So this is my sacrifice to help them feel noticed. 
 
224 
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,379 It's spreading fast. 
 
                225 00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,548 
Is it some kind of bio-weapon? 
 
226 
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,637 
[voice strains] 
A contagion bomb went off by accident. 
 
                227 00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,308 
-[Kovacs] These are the survivors? 
-[Bancroft grunts] They're descendants. 
 
                228 00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,145 
The plague killed thousands within hours. 
 
229 
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,482 
[grunts] 
 
                230 00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,902 
But left these carriers, you see. 
 
231 
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:50,366 
     And they were sealed off in hundreds of camps like these. 
 
                232 00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,746 
This isn't sacrifice. It's theater. 
 
233 
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:59,041 
         If you care so much, why don't you buy them new sleeves? 
 
234 
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,836 
           You're saying because I cannot fix everything, 
 
235 
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,173 I should fix nothing at all. 
 
236 
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,968 
[coughs] 
 
                237 00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,098 
Where is it? Where's the coffee? 
 
238 
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,976 Jesus. You, coffee. Hot. 
 
239 
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,103 Hey, hey. 
 
                 240 00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,522 -Hey. Found my Ghostwalker yet? 
-Working on it. 
 
241 
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,857 
Gonna get you to stop asking me to do things off the books? 
 
242 
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,775 Nope. 
 
                243 00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,903 [whispers] God damn it. 
 
244 
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,615 
It's Dimi the Twin. 
I need to spin him up in virtual. 
 
245 
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,660 
Then we got him? The double-sleever, that's great for erasure. 
 
                246 00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,580 
I need to ask him a few questions. 
About Ryker. 
 
247 
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,208 
-You don't want this logged. 
-I don't want this logged. 
 
248 
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,877 
There's no way that we spin him up in virtual without logging him. 
 
                    249 00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,630 -We'd have to sleeve him in the real. 
-Fine. Then we sleeve him. 
 
250 
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,425 
Okay. All right. 
I'll open a personality-fragged sociopath 
 
251 
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,969 
with several decades' worth 
of counter-infiltration firmware 
 
252 
      00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,637 and a reputation for wanton real death, 
 
253 
        00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,389 and throw him in the first available body. 
 
254 
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,890 
Great. You're the best, Mickey. 
 
255 
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,475 Ow. 
 
                256 00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,394 
-You really are the best. 
-I'm pretty good. 
 
257 
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,440 
 Mm-hmm. Mmm! Oh, my God, this is cold, God damn it! 
 
258 
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,443 Call me when you're done. 
 
259 
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,114 
[coughing] 
 
260 
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,409 
 [Bancroft] I give them something to believe in. 
 
                261 00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,079 
It's just another display of power. 
 
                262 00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:24,209 
Then you have misunderstood me. 
 
                263 00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:32,468 
For power, true power, is... is hidden. 
 
264 
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,388 
Like a mammoth sea creature 
 
265 
     00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:41,477 just beneath the surface of the ocean. 
 
                266 00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,523 
Nothing but the faintest of ripples. 
 
267 
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,281 
     I'd love to stay and debate the finer points with you. [coughs] 
 
268 
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,410 I-- I'm gonna cast out soon. 
 
269 
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,913 How long do we have? 
 
270 
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,630 
[crowd moaning in unison] 
 
271 
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,355 
[raven cawing] 
 
272 
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,695 
[jazz plays softly] 
 
273 
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,740 
[thunder rumbling] 
 
                274 00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,639 
Are you stealing his liquor now? 
 
                275 00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,433 
It's only stealing if you get caught. 
See any cops? 
 
276 
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,227 
[Abboud clears throat] 
 
                277 00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,234 
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this a bad time? 
 
                278 00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,617 [sighs] Nope. 
 
279 
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,677 
-[exhales] 
-Why are you here? 
280
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,390 Because I'm her partner. 
 
281 
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,352 
And because you wearing that face is tearing her apart. 
 
282 
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,396 So she told you I found out? 
 
283 
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,733 
This gonna be one of those friendly warnings? 
 
284 
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,443 It started friendly. 
 
                285 00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,908 
Ryker and Kristin, they were close. 
 
286 
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,203 
     After he went down, she came apart at the seams. 
 
287 
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:09,708 
    She believed she was responsible, so she convinced herself he was set up. 
 
288 
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,919 But the man had demons. 
 
289 
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,378 And enemies. 
 
290 
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,298 
You know she's been paying his sleeve mortgage? 
 
291 
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,302 
And on a lieutenant's pay. 
That's not an easy thing to do. 
292
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:25,599
    She never figured on an overbid like Bancroft pulled. It was terrible. 
 
293 
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,809 I know what you are. 
 
294 
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,564 
And I know that men and women in harm's way grow closer. 
 
295 
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,235 
[Abboud sighs] 
 
296 
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:41,198 
    Promise to treat her with decency and fairness. 
 
297 
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:46,078 
       And whatever this insanity is with Bancroft, you keep her away from it. 
 
                298 00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,045 
So what's my word worth to you? 
 
                299 00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,132 
Then I'll make my own promise. 
 
300 
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,845 Hurt her, and I kill you. 
 
301 
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,974 -You think you can keep that? -I do. 
 
302 
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,238 
You will take care of Kristin or you will answer to me. 
 
303 
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,865 I'm not here to save anyone. 304
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,702 Not even yourself? 
 
305 
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,590 
I brought you something you can actually use. 
 
                306 00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,050 
I spoke with a member of my union. 
 
                307 00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,846 
-You're part of a union? 
-The AI Management Association. 
 
                308 00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,764 
We manage a plethora of establishments. 
 
309 
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:52,978 
Music performance halls, restaurants, and various entertainment venues. 
 
310 
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,896 
             The point, before the next fuckin' ice age. 
 
311 
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,149 Ah, yes, well. It's Madison. 
 
                312 00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,612 
The AI who manages Fightdrome. 
 
                313 00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,165 
[automated female voice] Welcome home. 
 
314 
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,819 
-[Alazne yelling in Spanish] 
-[Kovacs in English] Calm down. 
 
315 
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,238 
[Alazne continues yelling in Spanish] 
 
316 
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,199 
 -[gun fires] -[Kovacs] Oh! 
 
                317 00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,658 
[in English] You're an abomination! 
 
318 
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,993 Don't shoot! 
 
                319 00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,620 
[Ortega in Spanish] Mom, give me that. 
 
320 
  00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,121 [in English] The hell's going on? 
 
                321 00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,831 
[in Spanish] I've got this. Give me that. 
 
                322 00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,959 
Okay, well, that explains everything. 
 
                323 00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,670 
-What the hell? 
-Guess she didn't like Ryker much, huh? 
 
                324 00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,297 [Ortega] Yeah, well. 
 
325 
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,758 
You know, it's getting easier 
to imagine putting holes in you 
 
326 
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,343 
every time you open your mouth. 
 
327 
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,138 
[knife chopping] 
 
328 
    00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,728 -I got a lead on Bancroft's murder. -[Ortega] Oh, yeah? 
 
329 
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,318 
  He was at Fightdrome the night he was killed. 
 
330 
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,862 
AI that manages the place says there's footage. 
 
                331 00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,826 
Fightdrome doesn't do footage. 
That's the whole point. 
 
332 
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,453 
          People pay top dollar for once-in-a-lifetime bloodlettings. 
 
333 
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,413 Just trust me. 
 
                334 00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,333 
[sighs] You sound just like Ryker. 
 
335 
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,877 You guys used to be partners. 
 
                336 00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,213 [sighs] Okay. 
 
337 
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,174 What are you getting at? 
 
338 
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,475 
    [Kovacs] Ryker have any mannerisms or speech patterns I should be aware of? 
 
339 
  00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,813 Well, I did the talking and Ryker mostly stood there looking angry. 
 
                340 00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,481 -I can do angry. 
-Yeah, no shit. 
 
                341 00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,483 
Just cross your arms or something. 
 
                342 00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,696 [chuckles] My, my. 
 
343 
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,865 Elias Ryker. 
 
344 
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,993 So the rumors are true. 
 
345 
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:18,957 You're back from the rack and riding your old skin. 
 
                 346 00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,836 -How'd that happen, Lieutenant? 
-None of your business, Carnage. 
 
347 
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,007 
Is that a new synth sleeve? 
Thought the whole point was 
 
348 
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,259 you could rearrange the face 
into whatever you want. 
 
349 
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,677 It is. 
 
350 
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,721 And I did. 
 
351 
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,934 Ah. Sorry. Private property. 
 
352 
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,646 
  I think my all-access pass is that you have cameras recording the fights. 353 
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,065 
[chuckles] 
 
354 
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,862 
I built my brand on never broadcasting, never recording anything-- 
 
355 
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,031 
[Ortega] Laurens Bancroft was here the night he died. 
 
356 
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,242 
We're following up. 
We'd like to look at what happened. 
 
                357 00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,915 
-Or should I return with a warrant? 
-[chuckles] 
 
358 
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,084 Hmm. 
 
359 
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,340 Take it down a little bit. 
 
360 
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,591 What? 
 
361 
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,385 Stocked up on inventory. 
 
362 
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,679 Ever expanding. 
 
                363 00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,307 
We have a humiliation bout coming soon. 
 
                364 00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,142 
-Very exclusive. 
-[Ortega] Oh, yeah?  365 00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:23,063 Still working out the details. 
But we do have our subject matter. 
 
                366 00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,690 
-Classic or modern? 
-[Carnage] Oh, bit of both. 
 
367 
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,985 So, who talked? 
 
368 
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,948 
[Ortega] We have data rats. 
Rats dig. They dug something up. 
 
369 
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,910 
Does your rat have a name? 
I'd like to meet him. Or her. 
 
                370 00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,829 
-Or it. 
-[Ortega] Sure. I'll introduce you. 
 
371 
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,675 
        Hot rod Envoy flesh, with all the modern accoutrements. 
 
372 
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,720 
Taken from DNA harvested on Harlan's World. 
 
373 
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,806 You like it? 
 
374 
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,350 Yeah. I can tell. 
 
375 
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,311 
I found a single cloning facility in Edmonton 
 
376 
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,772 willing to stitch together 
something ancient and illegal 
 
377 
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,524 for a one-time bloodletting. 
 
378 
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:12,737 
Cost me a king's ransom to grow him, but people love the classics. 
 
                379 00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,867 
Would you like to see it fight? 
 
380 
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,871 Would you like to see it die? 
 
                381 00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,791 
Or maybe you'd like to wear it? 
 
382 
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,626 This old thing's worn out. 
 
383 
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,961 Come back Friday. 
 
384 
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,380 I'll put on a private show. 
 
385 
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,715 Come on, Ryker. 
 
                386 00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,811 [Ortega] Pre-digital tape? 
 
387 
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,604 Old-school. 
 
388 
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,275 
Practically pre-school and thus unhackable. 
 
389 
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:54,279 
But apparently still whispered about in the datastream. 
 
390 
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,198 
[crowd shouting] 
 
391 
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,118 [Ortega] Hmm. That's Isaac. 
 
392 
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,206 And here comes Bancroft. 
 
393 
   00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,012 Bancroft was clearly on something. 
 
394 
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:22,098 
         Or clearly wanted to kill the shit out of his son. 
 
395 
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,237 
[thunder rumbles] 
 
396 
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:37,822 There. 
 
397 
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,866 
I've given you a free show, 
 
398 
    00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,660 which is more than anyone else alive has ever gotten from me. 
 
399 
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,578 Show's over. 
 
                400 00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,801 
You know I can read lips, right? 
 
401 
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,764 
-[thunder rumbling] 
-See, Bancroft kept saying, 
402
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,518
"You're not me. You never will be," over and over again. 
 
403 
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,811 What do you make of that? 
 
404 
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,064 
[Ortega] Look, you want to believe the guy was murdered, so... 
 
405 
       00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,775 father attacked son. That goes to motive. 
 
406 
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,569 
But Isaac and just about everyone else on Earth 
 
407 
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,987 didn't have the means. 
 
408 
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,199 
No one can open that gun safe except Miriam or Bancroft. 
 
409 
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,659 It's gene-locked. 
 
410 
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,163 
I was trying to get Ryker to quit this shit. 
 
                411 00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,998 [scoffs] Jeez. 
 
412 
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,934 This is it. 
 
413 
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,737 
I could call for a search warrant, 
 
414 
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,530 but it may be faster to go 
for a knock and-- 
 
415 
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,578 Or Kovacs. We could Kovacs. 
 
416 
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,621 
[alarm beeping] 
 
417 
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,917 
[Ortega sighs] 
 
418 
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,254 
-[ONI beeps] 
-[alarm deactivates] 
 
419 
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,384 What? 
 
                420 00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,472 
Security alarms all call the police. 
And I am the police. 
 
421 
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,954 Bills of sale. 
 
422 
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,957 These are real. 
 
423 
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,769 Emitters. 
 
424 
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,483 [Ortega] They're ONI-keyed. 
 
425 
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,527 
[beeping] 
 
                426 00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,447 
I can override the security seals. 427
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,954 Why is he watching this? 
 
428 
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,081 He hates his father. 
 
                429 00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,423 
How do I know you are who you are? 
 
                430 00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:47,887 
Before stacks, yeah. A face is a face. 
But now, could be anyone in there. 
 
431 
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,520 
[beeping] 
 
432 
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,986 It's up to you. 
 
433 
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,530 Kovacs. 
 
434 
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,451 There you go. 
 
435 
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,914 Wow. 
 
                436 00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,668 
Portable 3-D bio-organic printer. 
 
437 
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,922 
          Do you have any idea how illegal and expensive these are? 
 
                438 00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,884 
The cell mass you need to print is just... 
 
439 
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,802 Wow.
                440 00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,930
Even Bancroft slow-grows his clones. 
 
441 
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,516 
This must have cost Isaac everything he had. 
 
442 
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,852 
[Kovacs] Guess we know why he was selling art. 
 
                443 00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,745 [Ortega] Bancroft. 
 
444 
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,501 
The Japanese didn't deal with Bancroft in Osaka. 
 
445 
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,837 Bancroft wasn't Bancroft. 
 
446 
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,881 It was Isaac. 
 
447 
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,800 
Japanese told me they'd been dealing with Bancroft for months. 
 
448 
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,219 
Then Bancroft closes the deal in less than 48 hours? 
 
449 
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,555 
Doesn't let Isaac use an older sleeve, 
 
450 
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,224 keeps him young 
so no one takes him serious. 
 
451 
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,894 But if Bancroft dies... 
452
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,605 the kids get nothing. 
 
453 
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,399 So he can't die. 
 
454 
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,237 
       Isaac didn't have to compete with his father. He could be his father. 
 
                455 00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:33,493 
Replace him, take everything he had. 
 
456 
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,833 So how does it feel... 
 
457 
    00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,629 to be a few hours away from freedom? 
 
                458 00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,596 
-I have to call this in. 
-[ONI beeps] 
 
459 
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,473 It's Ortega. 
 
460 
00:32:56,516 --> 00:33:00,144 
   I need a team for a gene-mat sweep and transport for an unlicensed sleeve. 
 
                461 00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:02,897 3-D printed. 
 
462 
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,152 
Yeah, might as well pick up the printer, too. 
 
463 
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,239 Sure. I'll wait here. 
 
464
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:30,258 
[Kovacs] Finding truth is more than a search for data. 
 
465 
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,052 It's an excavation of self. 
 
466 
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,056 
    You have to keep going, no matter where it takes you. 
 
                467 00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,976 
Because nothing can stay hidden forever. 
 
468 
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,157 You're coming with me. Now. 
 
469 
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,498 You're gonna need this. 
 
                470 00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,851 
-This is Ryker's place? 
-It's our place. 
 
471 
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,521 Or was gonna be. 
 
472 
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,319 Take that off. 
 
473 
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,656 Sit down. 
 
474 
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,127 This is gonna hurt. 
 
475 
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,929 
                    [Kovacs] I guess you stitched up Ryker a lot, too? 
 
476 
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,140 Someone had to. 
477
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,942 Where's this from? 
 
478 
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,447 
A dealer in the Mariposa district, high on synamorphesterone. 
 
                479 00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,117 
It's a male aggression enhancer. 
 
480 
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,035 They call it Stallion. 
 
481 
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,000 
 Guy killed half his family by the time Ryker got there. 
 
482 
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,421 
  This is what it took to save the other half. 
 
483 
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,346 What about this one? 
 
                484 00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,560 
Steel-tipped boot with a toe blade. 
 
485 
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,730 
   Right Hand of God martyr, resisted arrest in New Haight. 
 
486 
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,674 When you look in my eyes... 
 
487 
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,888 what do you see? 
 
488 
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,601 They're not your eyes. 
 
489
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,609 What about this? 
 
490 
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,905 That one's from me. 
 
                491 00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,450 
I forget why, but you deserved it. 
 
492 
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,126 This is a mistake. 
 
493 
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,630 
[sighs] 
 
494 
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,718 When I look into his eyes, 
I see you looking back at me, and... 
 
495 
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,474 it's been a long time 
since someone looked at me like that. 
 
496 
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,227 I'm sorry I'm not Elias. 
 
497 
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,981 Just shut the fuck up. 
 
498 
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,950 
[both panting] 
 
499 
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:46,889 
[Ortega moans] 
 
500 
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,934 Wake up. 
 
                501 00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,359 -Hey. 
-Hey. 
 
502 
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,742 Who's this? 
 
503 
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,370 Mary Lou Henchy. 
 
504 
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:40,544 Someone offed the CTAC and pinned it on Ryker. 
 
505 
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,966 
[rapid knocking at door] 
 
                506 00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,889 
[Tanaka] BCPD! Open the door! Ryker! 
 
                507 00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,397 
-What the fuck? 
-Ryker, you're under arrest 
 
508 
    00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,315 for the murder of Leonid Kye Harris, 
 
509 
      00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,442 a senior sys op and CTAC administrator. 
 
                    510 00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,404 -What the hell are you talking about? 
-Kristin, stay out of this. 
 
511 
 00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,823 Captain, I didn't kill anyone. 
 
                512 00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,202 
Then you won't mind coming in. 
 
513 
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,622 They got to you. 
 
                514 00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,332 -Whoa! Whoa! 
-They get to everyone. 
 
                515 00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,835 
-Elias... 
-Nobody got to me, son. 
 
516 
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,086 This doesn't have to happen. 
 
                517 00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,296 
-Elias. 
-[Tanaka] Now just put the gun down. 
 
                518 00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,050 [Ryker] You fucked me. 
 
519 
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,011 Elias, put the gun down. 
 
520 
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,014 
    You gonna arrest me for doing my fucking job? 
 
                521 00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,476 
Elias. Put it down. Put it down. 
 
                522 00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,438 
Just... look at me. Look at me. 
 
523 
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,859 If this is a mistake... 
 
524 
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,902 If?  
525 
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,155 -You have nothing to-- -If? 
 
526 
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,495 If? 
 
527 
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:02,877 Go.  
                528 00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:11,719 
How could you not fucking believe me? 
How could you not fucking believe me? 
 
                529 00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,853 [cries] Don't fucking... 
 
                530 00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,571 
Mary Lou's mother came to the station. 
She was... 
 
531 
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,991 
She was desperate, so... [sighs] 
 
532 
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,037 
            I made sure she got Mary Lou's sleeve back. 
 
533 
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,038 
But I kept her, 
 
534 
    00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,583 just in case by some fucking miracle 
we get to ask her what happened to her. 
 
535 
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,542 
[sniffles] 
 
536 
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,795 
[beeps] 
 
537 
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,006 Look at all these people. 
 
538 
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,761 
All my answers are right here and I just can't have them. 
 
539 
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,596 I've got nothing. 
 
540 
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,307 You will not be forgiven. 
 
541 
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,558 I've seen these two before. 
 
542 
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,686 They were murdered? 
 
543 
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,104 Yeah. 
 
544 
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,106 
Every one of them sleeve-dead 
 
545 
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,817 and every one of them 
supposedly converted Neo-C. 
 
                546 00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,820 
You believe the conversions are fake? 
 
547 
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,199 Ryker did. 
 
                 548 00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,786 -Be a hell of a market for that. -Mmm-hmm. 
 
549 
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,997 
     Except it's impossible, like a lot of things right now. 
 
                550 00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,459 
There's this man who doesn't exist. 
 
551 
  00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,088 Mickey calls him the Ghostwalker. 
I saw him at Bancroft's party, 
 
552 
 00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:32,925 but somehow he wipes his image 
from all recordings on the fly. 
 
553 
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:33,842 How? 
 
554 
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,636 What does it look like? 
 
                555 00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,898 
[Ortega] I'm not sure about the mustache. 
 
556 
    00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:52,486 This guy and Dimi are the only leads 
I have left on the Mary Lou Henchy case. 
 
557 
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,366 
So you figure if he can cover his tracks, then maybe he covered hers? 
 
558 
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,996 
Erased information on how she fell, where she fell from? 
 
559 
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,833 
Yeah. I mean, maybe. 
I need to question him. 
 
560 
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,544 
Mickey's trying to put together an algorithm 
 
                561 00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,422 to trace the untraceable man, but so far, no luck. 
 
562 
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,967 
Ryker's case. 
Bancroft's murder. Ghostwalker. 
 
563 
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,804 
-They're connected. -Yeah. 
 
                564 00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:23,017 
-But they fucked up. -How? 
 
                565 00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,103 
Because they haven't killed me yet. 
 
566 
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,523 
[ONI beeps] 
 
567 
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,693 Hey, Mickey. What you got? 
 
568 
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,167 I take lead. 
 
569 
   00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,257 [Russian accent] You had to put me in sleeve with a fucking hangover? 
 
                570 00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,593 
Tastes like cat vomited in my mouth. 
 
571 
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,927 I'm glad you like it. 
 
572 
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:03,390 
[groans and laughs] 
 
573 
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,518 I see you grew your legs back since we parted. That's nice. 
 
574 
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,229 
[grunts and laughs] 
 
575 
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,231 
[spits] 
 
576 
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,276 I have rights, you know. 
 
577 
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,903 Who do you work for, Dimi? 
 
                578 00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,198 
Hoping for a confession, Lieutenant? 
[chuckles] 
 
                579 00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:23,327 
Elias Ryker? Or whoever you are. 
 
580 
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,538 You could be anyone. 
 
581 
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,832 A cunning CTAC agent, huh? 
 
582 
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,252 [in Russian] Oh, the crudity! 
 
                583 00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,047 
[in English] This man? This woman, maybe? 
 
584 
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,633 
Even a dog could be trained 
to say as much as he has, 
 
585 
       00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,219 given the right tranquilizers, of course. 
 
586 
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:43,430 
They do tend to go pitifully insane when you decant them if not. 
 
587 
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,225 But, yes, even a dog. 
 
588 
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,228 
     She's got you cold for double sleeving, Dimi. 
 
589 
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,688 Limited vision. 
 
590 
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,858 
Where is the voice 
 
591 
     00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:59,613 that said altered carbon would free us from the cells of our flesh? 
 
592 
       00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:03,492 The visions that said we would be angels. 
 
593 
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:11,917 
Instead, we became hungry for things that reality could no longer offer. 
 
594 
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,086 The lines blurred. 
 
595 
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,422 
[sighs] 
 
                596 00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,758 
You want to know who I work for? 
 
597 
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,762 
The people who understood that, 
 
                598 00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:27,474 who used it to become wealthy beyond words 
 
599 
       00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:31,770 in the only currency that truly matters: 
 
600 
 00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,481 the appetites of the immortal. 601 00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,359
Just tell me who had you frame Ryker. 
 
602 
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,363 
Come on, Dimi. 
Give him up, you skip real death. 
 
                603 00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,740 
A hundred years in the dark instead. 
 
                604 00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,078 
[in Russian] Oh, this is hilarious. 
 
605 
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,080 
[laughs] 
 
606 
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,041 
  [in English] I know police do the real thing in virtual. 
 
                607 00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,003 
There is no deal on the table. 
 
                608 00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,838 
There's a fucking gun on the table! 
 
                609 00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,590 -Talk and I don't blow your stack out. 
-Ortega... 
 
610 
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,842 
    Know the difference between virtual and life? 
 
                611 00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,677 
-[Tanaka] Where are they? 
-One's real. 
 
612 
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,636 
[Dimi chuckles] 
 
613 
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,516 
   In a construct, you know everything is being run by an all-powerful machine. 
 
                614 00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,895 
-He's stalling. 
-Reality doesn't offer the same assurance, 
 
615 
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:16,064 so it's very easy 
to develop the mistaken impression 
 
616 
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,774 that you are in control. 
 
                  617 00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:21,320 -I want a name! I want a fucking name! 
-Okay. Okay. 
 
                  618 00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,071 
[Tanaka] Ortega, where the hell are you? 
 
619 
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,241 
Bob. [laughs] 
 
                     620 00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,745 -Kill him. Blow his fuckin' stack out. -Yeah. 
 
621 
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,997 Ortega? This is over! 
 
622 
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,958 
Grab the Envoy. 
Get this fucking guy out of here. 
 
623 
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,920 No. Tanaka! 
 
                624 00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:41,423 
-[Ortega] No! 
-I should not be surprised. 
625
 00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:46,386 -Tanaka, just please, let me-- -I should fire you. 
 
                626 00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,181 -He framed Ryker, God damn it! 
-Oh, yeah? Who is he? 
 
627 
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,557 Dimi the Twin. 
 
                 628 00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,934 
-Dimitri fucking Kadmin? -Yeah. 
 
                 629 00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,561 -Kadmin? Are you out of your mind? 
-[Ortega] Okay. 
 
630 
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,647 
Give me five minutes in virtual, that's all. 
 
631 
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,024 
You partnered up with an Envoy and he played you. 
 
                632 00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,027 
-I will keep my promise. 
-You don't have a clue what's happening. 
 
                633 00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,278 [Ortega] Kovacs, shut up. 
 
634 
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,364 Let me ride down with Dimi. 
 
635 
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,282 A few more questions. Please. 
 
                636 00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,243 -All right. Go. 
-Thank you. 
 
637 
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,453 Not without me you don't. 
 
                638 00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,997 
Get the fuck out of my station. 
 
                639 00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,583 
-[Ortega] I know what I'm doing. 
-[Abboud] You're out of control. 
 
                640 00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,626 [Ortega] Samir... 
 
641 
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,796 
[Abboud sighs] 
I'm done covering for you. Never again. 
 
                642 00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,881 
-Samir... 
-[Abboud] Stop. 
 
643 
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:24,967 Ortega! 
 
644 
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,100 Are you a believer? 
 
645 
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,898 
-[screams] 
-[all grunting] 
 
646 
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,326 
[gunshot] 
 
647 
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,204 
[Ortega screams] 
 
648 
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,627 
I appreciate that you are no quitter. 649 00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,130

[whimpers] 
 
655 
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,214 
May the Lord, in his love and mercy, 
 
656 
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,052 help you with the grace 
of the Holy Spirit. 
 
657 
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:53,555 
       You're doing this in a fucking police precinct? 
 
                658 00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,434 
May the Lord who frees you from sin... 
 
659 
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,776 save you and raise you up. 
 
660 
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:17,996 Amen.

[gun clicks] 
 
662 
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,796 We have to go now! 
 
663 
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:26,880 Come. 
 
664 
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,644 Abboud. Abboud. 
 
665 
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,896 Abboud. 
 
666 
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,943 Abboud. Abboud.

[whimpering, gasping] 
 
 669 00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,599 [panting] Help him. 
 
670 
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,439 Help Abboud. 
 
671 00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,441 
-Get out of the way! 
-Help Abboud.

-Mama. Mama. Mama. 
 
23 
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,607 
[in English] It's gonna be okay. 
It's gonna be okay. 
 
                24 00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,150 
I promise, it's gonna be okay.

-It's gonna be okay.

00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,945 [in Spanish] He's behind you. 
 
28 
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,037 [in English] You defy a god.

-[grunts] 
-[echoes] You defy a god.

31

Where are you? [breathing heavily] 
 
32 
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,712 Where are you? 
 
33 
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,756 Come on! 
 
                34 00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,883 
Punishment must fit the transgression. 
 
35 
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,801 What do you mean, pendejo? 
 
36 
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,098

[grunting, panting] 
 
                38 00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,068 
This isn't real. This is a construct. 
 
39 
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,945 Everything you've seen is real. 
 
40 
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,989 
They're all dead. 
I recorded it for you to relive. 
 
                 41 00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,327 -How many times have I done this? 
-Quite a few. But we are far from done. 
 
                 42 00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,081 
I erase it and we start again. 
 
43 
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,958 No. No. No. 
 
44 
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,502 No! 
 
45 
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,220 No. 
 
46 
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,473 This is a construct. 
 
                47 00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,601 
How many times have I done this? 
 
48 
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,311 Not nearly enough.

No. 
 
53 
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,794 Let me out! 
 
54 
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,338 Do you hear me? 
 
                55 00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,218 
Can anyone hear me? Let me out! 
 
56 
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,596 Let me out!

00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,944 Tak! 
 
60 
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,531 
There are no guns on this ship except mine. 
 
61 
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,076 Don't. 
 
62 
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,202 
Triggered against a stack, 
 
63 
  00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,455 those batons have enough current 
to cause mental damage. 
 
64 
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,541 
A few seconds longer, real death, so I suggest you stay still. 
 
65 
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,960 
[Elliot grunts] 
 
66 
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,631 Shit. 
 
67 
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,802 It's true. 
 
68 
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,764 Damn Ava Elliot. 
 
69 
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,558 
It's all my idea. 
She's doing what I asked. 
 
70 
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,978 
          Don't think for a second you haven't broken my heart by doing it. 
 
71 
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,356 
Do I sound the alarm? 
Alert the ship's staff? 
 
72 
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,775 No. 
 
73 
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,486 
We give his people no warning he's been caught. 
 
74 
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,570 Trace the satellite hack. 
 
75 
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,449 If it came from that hotel, 
I want that AI reduced to nanodust. 
 
76 
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,867 Bring the others here. 
 
77 
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,286 
-Rei, just listen to me. 
-[Rei] Why? 
 
78 
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,080 You never listened to me. 
 
79 
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,083 
When you joined the Protectorate, when the yakuza bought me, 
 
80 
     00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,087 even when you said yes to the Envoys, you made all the decisions. 
 
81 
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,089 It ends here. 
 
82 
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,678 
[raven cawing] 
 
83 
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,643 
The pulse blew out everything. [sighs] 
 
                84 00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,521 
It's not rebooting. I can't get a signal. 
 
                85 00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,482 
-I know. 
-Then why are you not worried? 
 
86 
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,025 
Because I skipped over worry 
 
                      87 00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,735 -and went straight to full-on panic. -Huh. 
 
                      88 00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,907 -Are you sure that the dip went through? 
-Yeah. I burnt that bitch down. 
 
89 
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,992
You should not have done that. 
 
90 
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,874 
[machine whirring] 
 
91 
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,756 
Why didn't your sensors tell you that I had come inside? 
 
92 
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,767 
Perhaps there's a malfunction in your systems? 
 
93 
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,360 What... 
 
94 
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,155 is happening? 
 
95 
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,492 Electron destabilizer. 
 
96 
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,369 No. 
 
97 
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,331 Miss Elizabeth? 
 
98 
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,212 Ah. 
 
                99 00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,673 
They're killing me in the real. 
 
100 
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,592 
You cannot stay here. 
They will come for you. 
 
101 
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,552 They were always coming. 
 
102 
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,099 
Give me your hand. 
I'll send you onto the Array. 
 
                103 00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,601 
-You'll be safe. -No. 
 
                104 00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,522 
-No time to argue. 
-I'll go, but I don't run away anymore. 
 
105 
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,025 I run toward. 
 
106 
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,068 Send me up to the sky. 
 
107 
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,112 
-I cannot let you-- 
-I know the tree now, 
 
108 
        00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:12,617 the branches spreading in every direction. 
And I can see them all. 
 
                109 00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,161 
AIs are easy to kill with the right tools. 
 
                110 00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,791 
If you don't send me, they catch me. 
 
111 
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,420 
[shudders] 
 
112 
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,633 What is it that you see? 
 
113 
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,885 Salvation. 
 
114 
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,473
Death. 
 
115 
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,269 
-[grunts] 
-[gunshot] 
 
                116 00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,313 [Ava] Mickey! 
 
117 
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,608 
You shot him through the stack, you son of a bitch! 
 
118 
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,652 Retribution. 
 
119 
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,532 
    Perhaps you could tell me in what order? [chuckles softly] 
 
120 
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,033 
[grunting] 
 
                121 00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,290 
It's time for you to send me away. 
 
                122 00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,334 
-I can't. 
-You can. 
 
123 
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,418 You do. 
 
124 
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,255 You already have. 
 
125 
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,465 You gave me so much. 
 
126 
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:15,054 
Whatever it means to be human, Eddie... 
you are. 
 
127 
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:22,270 
You don't deserve to be called human, you despicable creature. 
 
                128 00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,691 
And you are a dead machine walking. 
 
129 
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,485 
Mmm-mmm. [chuckles softly] 
 
130 
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,864 Then I will see you in hell. 
 
131 
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,243 I'm sending your mind to Head in the Clouds. 
 
132 
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,705 Be careful, Lizzie. 
 
                133 00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,207

00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,650 for there was no other. 
 
445 
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,862 
She was the fiercest of warriors, 
 
446 
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,199 beloved of her people, 
unstoppable on the field. 
 
447 
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,579 She rode out every day and saved her subjects 
 
448 
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,790 in battle after battle. 
 
449 
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,842 
       But every night, when the fighting was done, 
 
450 
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,719 she was alone. 
 
451 
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:57,266 
Until one day, a peasant boy came looking to join her army. 
 
                452 00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,229 
Lonely and angry and fierce as she. 
 
453 
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:02,939 
For the first time, 
 
454 
   00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,818 she found that when she strode out 
onto the field to save others, 
 
                455 00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:11,572 there was someone at her side 
who had come to save her. 
 
456 
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,451 
         Then there came the darkest battle of the war. 
 
457 
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:19,872 
The princess and her peasant boy stood, side by side, 
 
458 
     00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:24,877 and vowed that they would be separated 
by nothing less than death itself. 
 
459 
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,630 She fell to an enemy sword... 
 
460 
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,300 and died before his eyes. 
 
461 
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:51,029 
And those who heard the story cried for the death of love. 
 
                462 00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,495 
This is an unusual situation, Mr. Kovacs. 
 
463 
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,332 
We were able to pull your stack 
from the wreckage in the bay, 
 
464 
     00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,585 but your sleeve was killed on impact. 
 
465 
 00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,253 So that's why we're in virtual.  

                466 00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,921
That's part of what's unusual. 
 
467 
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,717 Your counterpart has refused to be debriefed in the real. 
 
468 
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,345 
Well, I've been on an island getting laid and he crashed and died, 
 
469 
  00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,891 so the least I could do was share 
the same shitty virtual questioning. 
 
                470 00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,603 
-It's a solidarity thing. 
-That would be exactly the problem. 
 
471 
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,607 
Although there's a pardon for Takeshi Kovacs, 
 
472 
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,733 it's only for one of you. 
 
473 
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,987 
[woman] The UN has taken over this investigation 
 
474 
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,823 due to the sensitive nature 
of what you've uncovered, 
 
475 
       00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,119 and while we're grateful for the service 
you've both done for the Protectorate 
 
476 
     00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,205 in exposing this criminal activity... 
 
477 
00:34:42,288 > 00:34:46,209
We can't allow two Kovacs DHFs to survive. It's illegal. 
 
478 
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,669 So one of us has gotta die. 
 
479 
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,089 It'll be your decision. 
 
                480 00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,966 
-Together. 
-All right, let me talk to him. 
 
481 
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,595 And I choose the construct. 
 
482 
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,817 The look on her face. 
 
483 
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,987 
    The look on her face when I pulled the trigger. 
 
484 
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,743 It was almost relief. 
 
                485 00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:25,039 
Maybe she realized what she'd become. 
 
486 
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,876 A way for her to let go. 
 
487 
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,047 You saw her eyes. 
 
488 
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,550 Could you tell? 
 
489 
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,595 I don't know. 
 
490 
 00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,144 And I don't think I ever will.
 
491 
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,569 
We gotta decide whose memories to keep, yours or mine. 
 
492 
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:59,157 
[scoffs] That's a funny way to ask which one of us is gonna die. 
 
493 
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,908 Play for it? 
 
494 
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,495 Rock, paper, scissors? 
 
495 
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,716 
[chuckles softly] 
 
496 
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,647 
[in Spanish] 
Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord. 
 
                497 00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,693 
Let perpetual light shine upon them. 
 
498 
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,574 
             May their souls and all the souls of the departed... 
 
499 
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,660 through the mercy of God... 
 
500 
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,372 rest in peace. 
 
                501 00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,920 
-Amen. 
-[footsteps approaching] 
 
502 
00:37:06,224 > 00:37:07,350
[in English] How? 
 
503 
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,770 I was double-sleeved. 
 
504 
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,189 One of us died. 
 
505 
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,112 Which one are you? 
 
506 
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,365 The one you said goodbye to. 
 
507 
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,333 
-[indistinct chatter] 
-[classical music plays softly] 
 
                508 00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:40,258 
-[Miriam] Mmm. 
-It's beautiful, Miriam. Stunning. 
 
509 
  00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,763 I can't believe that I am looking at the fossil of an actual Elder. 
 
                510 00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,348 [Miriam] Mmm-hmm. 
 
511 
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:51,560 
It makes you wonder if memories of Elder civilization 
 
512 
     00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,313 are what gave us the idea for angels. 
 
                513 00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,440 
[Rei] He slagged his own stack. 
 
514 
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,902 
He has an archaic streak. You'd call it honor. 
 
515 
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,988 
The fool wanted to forget, 
 
516 
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,490 
as if that would make him clean of what he'd done. 
 
517 
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:09,161 
Explosive allegations implicating 
Laurens Bancroft, 
 
518 
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,331 
Meth mogul and one of the richest men of the Settled Worlds, 
 
519 
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,500 
in murder and sleeve death. 
 
520 
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:18,754 
The crash last week of Head in the Clouds, one of the Houses, 
 
521 
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,965 is said to be related. 
 
522 
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,301 
It's alleged Bancroft killed himself 
 
523 
     00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,804 in an attempt to escape feeling guilt for his crime, 
 
524 
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,182 but not until after 
he illegally influenced 
 
525 
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:34,270 
the members of the UN Court 
to defeat Resolution 653. 
 
526 
00:38:35,229 > 00:38:38,566
Pressure is mounting in the court to reconsider 653, 
 
527 
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,153 which would allow victims 
to testify against their killers, 
 
528 
   00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,698 even if they have religious coding on their stacks. 
 
529 
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,241 
[broadcast switches off] 
 
                530 00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,579 
[Miriam] Laurens, whatever you've done... 
 
531 
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,206 I'll stand by you. 
 
532 
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,339 I... 
 
533 
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,553 
  I may be many things, but I am not a murderer. 
 
                534 00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,181 
-Of course. 
-[footsteps approaching] 
 
535 
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,726 Prescott didn't kill you. 
 
536 
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,561 Get out. 
 
537 
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,146 You were alone in this room. 
 
                538 00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,733 
You weren't insane. Just a coward. 

 
                539 00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,734 [Bancroft] No. 
 
540 
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,112 No, I know who I am. 
 
                541 00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,699 
And in essence, I am a decent man. 
 
542 
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:32,453 
[chuckles] You're about to be arrested for the real death of Lena Rentang. 
 
                543 00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,663 
I don't even know who that is. 
 
544 
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,625 
That's 'cause you blew out your own stack to forget about her. 
 
545 
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:42,380 
       So this criminal Kawahara woman makes up a story and it gets on the feeds. 
 
546 
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,589 No one will believe it. 
 
                547 00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,175 
[Kovacs] They'll believe Mary Lou Henchy. 
 
548 
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:50,304 
       See, Reileen had her stack, and they just pulled it out of the bay. 
 
549 
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,683 
As soon as 653 moves forward, Mary Lou's gonna talk. 
 
550 
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:55,935 
[scoffs] 
 
551 
00:39:56,018 --> 00:40:00,356 
  I mean, even if you're right, that I real death'd that girl... 
 
552 
  00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,067 the person who did that is dead. 
I destroyed him. 
 
                553 00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,444 
You erased the memory, not the act. 
 
554 
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,948 This cannot be the man I am. 
 
555 
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,908 You lived too long. 
 
                556 00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,452 [Bancroft] I believed... 
 
                557 00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,707 
I believed I had a line I would not cross. 
 
                558 00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,546 
I believed I had a conscience. 
 
559 
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,216 
To put a gun to your own head when you want to live... 
 
560 
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,552 
that takes the will of a demon. 
 
561 
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:35,099 
You thought you were a god. 
You're more like the devil himself. 
 
                562 00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:40,855 
Sir, police are waiting downstairs. 
 
563 
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,660 
[low murmurs] 
 
564 
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,183 Look after the family, Isaac. 
 
565 
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,852 I'll leave everything to you. 
 
                566 00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,938 
As I should have done, a long time ago. 
 
567 
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:39,288 
        I surrender myself for the crimes I have committed. 
 
568 
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,581 We're not done here. 
 
569 
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,250 Right, Miriam? 
 
                 570 00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,045 [Bancroft] What? 
 
                 571 00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,423 -What's he talking about, darling? 
-I certainly have no idea. 
 
                     572 00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:54,220 -Haven't you done enough, Mr. Kovacs? 
-[door opens, closes] 
 
                     573 00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,852 -What is this person doing in my house? -Lizzie? 
 
574 
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,439 Say what you came to say. 
 
575 
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,155 For the longest time, 
I couldn't remember what happened to me. 576 
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,115 I couldn't even speak. 
 
577 
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,576 But I can now. 
 
578 
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,539 I got pregnant. 
 
579 
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,915 
[indistinct murmuring] 
 
580 
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,585 
I came up here to tell you, but you weren't here. 
 
581 
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,379 She was. 
 
                582 00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,549 
-Whore. 
-You watch what you say to my daughter! 
 
583 
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:36,679 
You hit me and you kicked me and you kept kicking me. 
 
584 
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,014 
-[Miriam screaming] 
-[Lizzie groaning] 
 
585 
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,142 I remember it all. 
 
586 
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,105 That's a lie. 
 
587 
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,609 Oh, my God. 
 
588 
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,403 I only wanted to talk to her. 
 
589 
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,281 
I offered her money. 
I offered her anything she wanted, 
 
590 
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,032 if she'd just get rid of it. 
 
591 
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:57,950 
[scoffs] 
 
592 
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,077 I got angry. 
 
593 
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,247 It was an accident. 
 
594 
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,748 You took my baby from me! 
 
595 
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,420 You had to have her stopped from getting spun back up. 
 
                596 00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:15,426 
You asked me to get you a fixer. 
So I got you the best. 
 
597 
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,054 
    [Kovacs] So Reileen took her to the Wei Clinic, drove her crazy, 
 
598 
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,514 and dumped her in an alley. 
 
599 
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,559 
        The cops didn't care about another sleeve-dead hooker, 
 
600 
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,561 
so no one found out about the baby. 
 
601 
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,896 Oh, for God's sake, Miriam. 
 
602 
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,398 
[crowd murmuring] 
 
603 
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,025 You don't understand. 
 
604 
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,986 The children are all I have. 
 
605 
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,281 The children are mine! 
 
606 
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:43,746 
But then Reileen wanted something back, so she had you drug your husband. 
 
607 
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,583 It was you? 
 
608 
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,545 It was you who betrayed me? 
 
609 
    00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,256 Don't you talk to me about betrayal. 
 
610 
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,264 You did this to me. 
 
611 
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,895 We have ruined each other. 
 
612 
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,605 Haven't we? 
 
613 
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,948 
Miriam Bancroft, you're under arrest for the sleeve death of Elizabeth Elliot 
 
614 
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,578 and the forcible termination 
of her pregnancy against her will. 
 
615 
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,247 
-[sighs] 
-[crowd murmuring] 
 
                616 00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,296 
[Kovacs] Ava Elliot was pardoned. 
 
617 
 00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:20,426 I paid off her sleeve mortgage, and got her her real body back. 
 
618 
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,596 Lizzie kept the synth. 
 
619 
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:30,144 
When anyone asks her why, she says, 
"Because it's not real." 
 
                620 00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,021 
And she doesn't know if she is, either. 
 
621 
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:36,608 
-[inaudible chatter] 
-[all laughing] 
 
                622 00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:43,031 
653 passed. 
The dead could now accuse their murderers. 
 
                623 00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,702 
The world changed. For all of us. 
 
                624 00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,580 -There's nothing left to unpack. 
-[Ortega] Really? 
 
625 
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,291 
-[thunder rumbles] -We can't be done. 
 
626 
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,254 
[sighs] 
 
627 
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,594 
-Do you think he'll like it? 
-[Kovacs] Ryker? 
 
628 
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:05,929 He's a lucky guy. 
 
                629 00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:10,559 
You're the reason why he was cleared. 
That's not luck. 
 
                630 00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,312 
He was cleared 'cause he was innocent. 
 
                631 00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,274 
He deserves to get his life back. 
 
632 
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,235 Everything he lost. 
 
                633 00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,877 
And after you turn Ryker's sleeve in... 
 
634 
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,755 where will you go? 
 
635 
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,050 I don't know. 
 
636 
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,594 I don't know anything... 
 
637 
 00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,765 except that she's still alive.  638 
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,021 Good luck, Takeshi Kovacs. 
 
639 
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,073 
[Quell] After his princess died, 
 
640 
     00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,742 the peasant boy wandered the world... 
 
641 
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,746 lost to despair. 
 
642 
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:19,336 
Until one day, he came upon an immortal 
 
643 
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,257 who told him his princess had been stolen, 
 
644 
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,426 trapped in an enchantment. 
 
645 
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:38,230 
        So now he seeks her, across this world and every other. 
 
646 
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,566 
Because somewhere, 
 
647 
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:45,362 sealed behind frozen glass 
and thick walls of deadly thorns, 
 
648 
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,655 she sleeps... 
 
649 
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,741 waiting to be awakened. 
 
650 
00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:00,419
And someday, without fail, 
he will find her.
