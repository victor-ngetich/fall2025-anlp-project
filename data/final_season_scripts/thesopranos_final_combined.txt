(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

Nobody ever went broke underestimating
the taste of the American public.

(COUGHING)

MAN: The ancient Egyptians
postulated seven souls.

The top soul and the first to leave
at the moment of death

is Ren:
the Secret Name.

This corresponds
to my Director.

He directs
the film of your life

from conception
to death.

"The Secret Name"
is the title of your film.

When you die,
that's where Ren came in.

Second soul
and second one

off the sinking ship
is Sekem:

Energy, Power, Light.
The Director gives the orders,

Sekem presses
the right buttons.

Number three is Khu:
the Guardian Angel.

He, she or it
is third man out.

Number four is Ba:
the Heart...

often treacherous.

Number five is Ka:
the Double.

The Ka, which usually
reaches adolescence

at the time
of bodily death,

is the only reliable guide
through the Land of the Dead.

Who's gonna live here?

A family. I'll have it
finished by October.

- I'm worried, Ade.
- Everybody's worried.

No. I am worried
all the time.

Number six is Khaibit:
the Shadow, Memory,

your whole past conditioning from this
and other lives.

Number seven is Sekhu:
the Remains.

I'm halfway to China.
There's nothing here.

40,000 I had...

my share of the Bohack's haul
from the '70s.

Did you wrap it right?

It gets moldy...
it could've disintegrated.

- Wrap what?
- The money.

He knows I need that money
for my fucking retrial!

- Who?
- You know who.

No, I don't know who.
That's why I asked you.

- Malanga.
- Will you stop with that?

Pussy Malanga's dead
six years now.

I should dig him up
already!

(DOOR CREAKS, SLAMS)

Moles. They chewing
through your sprinklers too?

40,000 I had...

my share of the Bohack's haul
from the '70s.

We'll look later.
You're gonna be late for your doctor's.

Come on.

JANICE: Hello?

TONY: Let me ask you something:

Is your time more valuable
than mine?

Where's the baby?

Sorry, Ton'. The car seat,
the other stuff...

packin' it in there
takes forever.

You probably
remember that.

No, I don't.
I didn't do that crap.

How are you feeling,
Uncle Jun', huh?

He's late enough, Janice.
Come on.

A hello to your niece,
maybe?

Hi, sweetie.
How are you?

Help him get ready,
will you?

- Yeah.
- Come on, Jun'.

- (BABBLES)
- (NICA GIGGLING)

So? How's he doing?

He's Knucklehead Smith,
that's how he's doing.

He's paranoid. He doesn't remember
whether he ate or not.

The man is not
competent, Tony.

- Not again, come on!
- He has the money for assisted living.

He's got legal bills
up the ass.

He can sell this museum
and move to Green Grove.

Fuck assisted living, okay?
Remember what they did to Ma?

- She was thriving there, Tony.
- He stays where he is, Janice.

He's our uncle.
It's the least we can do.

So the split,
your friend in Jersey

says it should be the same
as the old business we do over there.

That's public works,
this isn't.

- I'll hold the line.
- Don't turn it into World War III.

So day to day,
how are you getting along with Tony?

You asked me
to bury the hatchet, John.

I'm doing it
out of respect to you.

Am I still grieving
over my brother Bill?

It'll never go away.

I appreciate it, Phil.

- With me in here...
- I hear you, John.

(DOOR BUZZES)

Your bride...
she's a rock for you, kid.

Her brother's fitting me
for contacts.

When the trial starts,
I don't wanna be

reading documents
in the courtroom with glasses.

It looks weak.

- (KNOCKS)
- TONY: Yes?

(TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING)

- Hey, Ton'.
- Hey.

(DOOR CLOSES)

My sports book
down in Roseville,

Bacala's still making
things unpleasant.

- God damn it.
- Listen, Tony,

I got you something.

For you, Carm, the kids...
David Yurman watches.

18-karat gold,
diamond center.

Why do I get the feelin'
there's a jeweler somewhere

filin' an insurance
claim today?

Actually,
that ain't what it is.

- My Aunt Edie died.
- No?

That one that moved to California
back in the '60s?

She was a great lady,
the only person in my life

who ever made me
feel special.

What are you gonna do?

Anyway, the silver cloud
is she did pretty well.

She was married
to Victor Borge's agent.

She left me an inheritance, Ton'.
Just over two mil.

- Whoa.
- (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

Well, congratulations.

Make sure you invest it.

Well, you know, that's kind of
what I wanted to talk to you about.

Deanne and me
and the kids,

you know how much
we love Florida, right?

What, do you wanna put some money
on the street down there?

I was thinking about buying
a place in Fort Myers.

- Retiring there, actually.
- Retiring?

What, are you
a hockey player?

I'm gonna be 50 in three years, Ton'.
My dad died at 52.

You took an oath, Gene.
There's no retirin' from this.

Well, I thought about that,
and there was Joe Bananas.

(CHUCKLES)
Come on, huh?

What about your sports book,
your other responsibilities?

What am I supposed
to do about those?

Benny? We know
Bobby wants it.

It's just... we go back
a long way, Ton'.

Yeah, we do.

Fuckin' CYO Basketball,
do you believe that?

It'd mean a lot
to me and Deanne.

Well, let me
think about it.

Ooh, look at this one
with the pool.

Yeah, we could
go swimming.

Guess who's blocking
the driveway again.

Did you talk
to Tony?

It looks good.
He gave me a hug.

- Did he like the watches?
- Do I know my psychology?

The realtor called.
She's e-mailing some pictures.

- The one on River Road?
- The split level... the four-bedroom.

They lost the buyer?

Hey, there he is.
Where are you goin'?

- Kevin's.
- Who else is gonna be there?

- Gene.
- I don't know.

What's with this hostility all the time?
You want a smack in the mouth?

I told you I'm not
getting high anymore!

- I believe you.
- Stop fucking touching me.

Watch your mouth
in front of your sister!

I have a right to know
who your friends are!

Hey!

- Hey!
- (DOOR SLAMS)

(CAR ENGINE ROARING)

Spicy shrimp hand roll,
that's Nori's favorite,

special yellowtail,
toro scallion and oysters.

You tell me
when you wanna stop.

Well, keep it comin'.

I don't know about you,
but ever since we found this place,

I catch myself
fantasizing about this.

Me too.
Sometimes during sex.

So I had a nightmare the other night.
Did I wake you up?

- No.
- Ade was in the house,

my spec house.

Was she gonna buy it?

We were just talking.

Speaking of which,
did you call that guy,

the inspector
at the building department?

- I will. I promise.
- He's coming on Friday, Tony.

That could be
my last chance to get

a reversal
on the stop-work order.

All right, I'll call.

I wonder where she is.

- Ade.
- I told you, she probably met some guy.

And not call anyone
for over a year?

What's this,
this sauce on the shrimp?

Shiromi, tekka maki,
salmon with tomato.

So I was over
by Ginny's...

that situation is
not going so well.

Johnny cooped up
and awaiting trial,

plus now they're fighting
an asset seizure.

They could lose everything...
the house, the condo at the shore.

You know Jimmy Petrille,
the rat that gave up John?

He's like an uncle to him,
his father's compare.

Why do you think I toss at night?
Ain't just the apnea.

I noticed you haven't been taking
your antidepressants.

And yet, the bonefish
are back in season.

We should count our blessings,
the kind of year I just had.

You're right.
We're very lucky.

$40 for a piece of fish
they just flew in first class.

I think we're
more than lucky.

Great food in there.
It's pretty good.

You wanna keep
this baggie or shall I?

- Nah, you keep it for lunch.
- Okay.

We're here.

Thanks for dinner, Hesh.

Grease is coming through
the bag as usual.

Chinese food...
it's part of the tradition.

What the...

Whoa! Whoa!

What the fuck
is this?

Come on, come on!
Hey, where are you goin'?

Get out of the car!

Get out of here,
get out of here!

- Take a hike, Jimmy.
- Open up, Eli!

- Get out!
- Open the fucking door!

- Get out of here!
- What do you want me to do?

- I can't do anything!
- Fucking Jew!

- Let's go, old man!
- Open the fucking door!

Holy shit, they're trying
to burn us out!

- Open the fucking door!
- Get out, Hesh!

- Leave me alone!
- Jerry warned you, Eli!

Jerry fucking told you
to stay out of Brooklyn!

What are you guys doin'?
You're gonna kill this guy.

Fuck you, Grandpa!

I tell you, one of the best things
about dropping the weight,

a whole new wardrobe.
I keep this up,

I'm gonna need
Clothing Anonymous.

You should have called your sponsor
before you bought that jacket.

Look at this guy.

"Members Only"?
How long have you been wearing that?

Cugino mio!

You look sharp.
How do you feel?

Two miles I walk
every mornin'.

You goin' to little
Tommy's communion?

I gotta talk to Aunt Lenore.
Say hello to Marie for me.

Hold on, let me
get that number,

- the custom cufflinks.
- Oh yeah.

What'd that prick want?

Really something, isn't he,
with that jerk-off face?

The eyebrows...
I fucking can't stand him.

I gotta tell you though,
he surprised me.

He's acting boss,

takes care
of John's business,

plus the wife
while John's in jail.

No complaints.

He's real old school.

Gotta take
my hat off.

Cocksucker
wanted me killed?

What's past is past.
Leave it alone.

Things are
going good now.

You and Phil settle
that office park shit?

We said
we'd revisit it.

Agent Harris,
where've you been?

I got some new federale
in my rear view for six months.

- Actually, I've been in Pakistan.
- Get the fuck out.

Seriously.
I was transferred to terrorism.

This is my partner, Ron Goddard.
Tony Soprano.

The terrorist
squad, huh?

- What, did you lose a little weight?
- Uh...

You look good.
Atkins, right?

I caught a parasite over there.
Doctors don't know what it is.

- What do they eat, tabbouleh?
- Actually, that's why I'm here.

I've been dying for a Satriale's
veal parm hero.

Fuck him. I hope that parasite
eats his asshole out.

I kind of feel bad
for the guy.

Shit, when did
this happen?

Hold on.
Ton' just come in.

It's Hesh.

Yeah.

(HEART MONITOR BEEPING)

Here, honey.
It's ice.

(KNOCKS)

Tony.

Thank you.

Hey.

Beth, how're you doin'?

I've had
better weeks.

Could you get me
some coffee, sweetie?

- Anyone else?
- Hot water with lemon would be great.

My son-in-law and me,
we're having dinner Sunday,

Chinese restaurant near Mill Basin,
we get jumped by three guys in a Lexus.

- Chinks did this?
- Are you trying to be fucking funny?

- You want a smack in the mouth?
- What? I was serious.

They're with your cousin
Phil Leotardo.

I told you he was a prick!

- We were just with him.
- Let him talk.

I got some money
on the street over there.

Apparently, it got back
to Phil's guy

- Gerry Torciano.
- The Hairdo?

He claims that he felt
that Eli here was

some independent shy
trying to poach his customers.

- Is that a fucking catheter?
- Massive internal bleeding,

half his fucking skin
is sheared off his hips.

My daughter's
besides herself.

You send somebody to Brooklyn, and you
talk to Phil

- about this mook, this...
- Gerry Torciano.

(SIGHS)

Sorry I yelled
at you, kid.

(BIRDS CROWING,
CHIRPING)

I'm installing gable joists
in the rotunda.

I'm afraid I'm gonna have to agree
with the original assessment.

Oh, for the love
of Mike!

This is pine, sir...
utility grade.

I know what it is.
I've been building houses for years.

Then you know that the code calls
for Doug fir grade,

stamped for all floor joists,
ceiling joists, lintels and rafters.

Get Pudgie Walsh on the horn.
He'll straighten this out.

Pudgie Walsh
retired, sir.

- I'm affirming the stop-work order.
- Oh, come on!

- Is there nothing else we can do?
- For God's sake!

You can schedule a further appeal.
But if I were you,

I'd think about starting over
with the proper lumber.

God, 15 times
I asked you!

Do you know what this does
to my cost basis,

- to start over with this?
- It's bureaucratic bullshit!

- In my day, they'd turn a blind eye.
- I hired you to do a job!

Hired?
I'm not for hire.

You presented this
like we were partners.

- You don't listen to anybody, do you?
- Oh!

To hell with this.
No good deed goes unpunished.

Artie. Ho. - (WOMAN
SINGING ARIA ON RADIO)

Menus.

- Is that Phil?
- My wife.

What's it take to get that guy
to return a phone call?

I want this Hesh thing
settled.

Gentlemen,
start your engines.

Jesus Christ, Artie,
I can recite that menu in my sleep.

Where did he get this bread,
the bread museum?

The antipaste?

Fuckin' Phil.
Now I gotta go see the optometrist

to get a message to John
about this.

Go through
Ginny's brother?

He's a stunad
of the first magnitude.

I need a back channel
to John, obviously.

(SINGING CONTINUES)

- (SILVERWARE CLATTERS)
- What the fuck is it?

I can't catch
a fucking break!

This is Tony Soprano

talking about
the Angelo Giacolone murder.

The sound quality
is not good,

but I can back it up
in court.

He said...

(GRUNTS WEAKLY)

- (CROWD MUTTERING)
- (WOMAN CRYING QUIETLY)

You all right, Ton'?

Yeah.
That formaldehyde smell...

I knew this guy once,
Vietnam vet.

He drank formaldehyde
over there just to get high.

It's the alcohol.

Does he have to be here,
your fucking AA sponsor?

It ain't just that he helps me
with the disease, T.

This guy is great
at forging documents.

- He was a good kid, Raymond.
- The best.

At least he went fast.
Not like Dick Barone, poor fuck.

- Dick Barone died?
- Lou Gehrig's disease.

Did you ever think
what a coincidence it is

that Lou Gehrig died
of Lou Gehrig's disease?

You gonna make that same stupid joke
every time that comes up?

Sorry.

Everything's
so fucking morbid.

There's a man
lying dead over there.

I'm gonna go smoke.

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.

I don't know
what I was thinking.

For you.
Your taste.

The inheritance.

I didn't want
to say nothing,

with your aunt and all,
but this is thoughtful.

- So that thing we spoke about...
- Still mulling it.

Yeah, whatever.
Sure.

All right.
All right.

Look at this guy.
Not a day over 76. (CHUCKLES)

- Fucking ballbreaker.
- How are you, Rusty?

Is Phil Leotardo here?
'Cause I won't stay

- in the same room with that man.
- I haven't seen him.

So you hear about that guy
in Westchester?

Fucking captain,

doing his own radio broadcast
the last three years.

- W.R.A.T.
- Jesus Christ, another one now?

No wonder the papers are calling this
"The Year of the Rat."

Standup guys like that,
they're a dying breed.

Amen to that.

What can you do?

Anyway, let me go
pay my respects.

All right, Rusty.

- You okay?
- I gotta get out of here.

He's thinking about it.
What do you want me to tell you?

How many years have we dreamt
about this, to get out of this shit?

Every time someone
we know gets arrested...

I know. Will you stop?

I'm worried, Gene.
We've already made the offer.

I'm doing
everything I can.

Why are you fighting?

We're not fighting, sweetie.
We're talking.

- How come you're not in bed, hmm?
- I don't know.

All I'm saying is,
he has to see

this is a huge
opportunity for us.

Give the man
time to process.

- Oh, my God. This eel is delicious.
- (POP MUSIC PLAYING)

Okay, Spanish mackerel now.

Can I get
another sake, hon'?

(SIGHS) Listen, I got some
stuff I gotta take care of.

You okay
to drive yourself home?

I don't have
my car, Tony.

Oh, yeah.
So take this one.

- Hey, Mrs. S.
- What is this?

Oh my God.

Is this the new Porsche?

(GASPS)

Cayenne Turbo.
I got the 4.5-liter V-8.

Wasn't sure about the color,
so I took a shot.

Tony, I love it.
It's gorgeous!

I still wish you'd talked to that guy
at the building department,

but oh my God!
What a car!

Ho, Joe College,
where's your mother?

She went to the outlet stores
with Aunt Ro.

Is that the jacket
we got you for Christmas?

I'm lending it to Matt.

Hey, how was the interview
for the internship?

Got moved
to next week.

Would you mind keeping me
in the loop, though, since it was

- my lawyer that set it up, huh?
- Okay.

(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

- Matt don't have his own clothes?
- He's borrowing it for a party.

Oh, good.
You'll never see it again.

You have such a low
opinion of people.

(SIGHS)

Let me tell you
something, A.J.

I don't care
how close you are,

in the end, your friends
are gonna let you down.

Family. They're the only ones
you can depend on.

(SIGHS)

He was vital, my uncle,
alive.

For all his faults,
he was sharp in his day.

But now...

We stopped
at a light yesterday,

and I see this nanny,

black girl,
pushing a baby carriage.

Coming the other way,

there's another one

with this old lady
in a wheelchair

- staring off into space.
- The circle of life.

The circle jerk of life.
Where's the dignity?

If you're lucky, in the end you can
let go of your pride,

let your loved ones
care for you.

I'd rather they hold
a pillow over my face.

I find it interesting
you would say that.

You tried to smother
your mother with a pillow.

- What?
- In the hospital, after her stroke.

The fuck I did!

I grabbed a pillow,
but it was...

just to keep my hands
occupied.

Have you considered

getting your uncle
some live-in help?

We got a girl comes in days,
she's from Trinidad.

Does he have the means
for assisted living?

Did you just say to let your loved ones
take care of you?

- If it's feasible.
- Well, he's my uncle.

I don't think that's what
we're talking about.

What are we
talking about?

The fact that you still,
after all this time,

cannot accept you had a mother
who didn't love you.

In pitying your uncle,

the man she conspired with,

you're turning the blame
for what she did

back on yourself again,
after all this time.

What was your mother like?

Did she ever let you down,
hurt your feelings?

Of course she did.
She was controlling

and manipulative at times.

- She also never tried to kill me.
- I pushed her over the edge.

By placing her in a lovely
retirement community.

It's a nursing home!

It's less hurtful to believe
that they were right

to try and destroy you
than to accept the fact

that she didn't value you.

Hesh is a personal
friend of mine,

and the kid is
his son-in-law.

Now I know Phil's got
a lot on his plate, but come on.

I'll talk to John. I was taking
my sister there Saturday anyway.

How is Ginny?
Carmela says she's got her hands full.

The kid has the weight
of the world on her.

Ray-Bans.
Classic, affordable.

I just put those
on special.

You got something
a little more current?

- (BLOWS RASPBERRY)
- Like those.

Armanis.
Flexible acetate frames,

rimless lenses.

You know what?
I left my wallet in the car.

I'll catch you next time.

(GATE CRASHES SHUT)

(PEOPLE CONVERSING QUIETLY)

Some people
from the IRS came by.

They want to inventory
the entire house.

Maybe I should
sell the car,

at least get some
liquidity out of it.

The Maserati?

Can't say I disagree.

(CHUCKLES) That breaks
my fucking heart.

Christopher Moltisanti
came over to the house asking about it.

- He'll pay cash, he said.
- (SIGHS)

There's something else,
John,

Phil related.

The Hairdo, he's in a beef
with the Jew.

What?
God damn it, what?

The Jew's son-in-law.
It got physical.

Your friend from Jersey got involved,
but he can't get Phil to focus.

Do I not have enough
on my fucking mind?

The guy from Jersey
asked me to tell you.

Well, then call Phil
and have him fucking handle it!

Don't yell at my brother, John.
He's trying to do right by us.

The pictures
from Allegra's shower.

Noon he said, right?

Passive-aggressive
bullshit.

I recognize that in people
every time now.

- (DOOR OPENS)
- There he is.

Ho, finally. I was starting to grow
mushrooms out my ass.

There's an image.

So Gerry filled me in
on the way over.

This whole thing was
a complete misunderstanding.

Yeah, this Eli kid, I had any idea
he was with you,

- I would have never...
- He didn't tell you about Hesh?

I asked who he was. He high-handed me.
I thought he was a civilian.

Still, to get dragged
by a car?

For the record, though,
the car thing was a hit-and-run.

So what do we do here?

- What did we say?
- 25 sounds right.

He's bleeding internally.
Pain, suffering...

So you tell me. 50?

Yeah, fair enough.

Could we segue now
into something more pressing?

The floor is yours,
Senator.

I spoke to John. The split on the office
park is way out of whack.

Same thing
as the Esplanade.

Apples and bowling balls, Tony.
With fuel costs now...

Like you're not
passing that on to the drivers?

65-35.

All right.

Why you always cave
for this prick?

I'm not caving.
It's a strategy.

Johnny's in jail.
You keep him happy,

he'll keep a lid
on Phil.

Tony B,
Phil's kid brother,

the bad taste
that left with Phil...

there are 200 soldiers
in his family.

I'm not scared of them.

- Tony left?
- Yeah.

I stopped by Stewart's.
I got a whole lunch set up.

Did Tony mention anything to you
about what we talked about?

About you
moving to Florida?

Did he say if he's leaning
one way or the other?

Listen, there's something
I need you to do.

I got a call from Fritzie
up in Boston.

There's a guy named
Teddy Spirodakis, owes some money.

- You want me to collect?
- That ship sailed. Final notice time.

Really?

You got a problem
with that?

No.

I just gotta run it by Vito.
He's my captain.

Believe me,
Vito will be down with it.

So this comes from Tony?

It's coming from me.
I'm not a fucking captain?

All right, okay?

- How soon?
- ASAP.

Like right away.

I'll call with the details.
Get it done.

I'll put in a good word to T.
about the Florida thing.

(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING
OVER P.A.)

(GRUNTS, BELCHES)

The rear deck, didn't they say
that would be refinished?

That's the old photo.
It's been completely redone.

The wiring in the pool house?
Tell them they can knock

two grand off the price
or they can sell to someone else.

Listen, you're responding
to their counter.

You should ask
for whatever you want.

Okay, we'll call you
tomorrow.

All right then,
good night.

What do you think?

That if we lose this house,
I'm gonna die.

Ton', what do you want
to do for dinner?

I'll be right down!

Well...

Hey.

Your new insurance card.

Oh, good.

Any thoughts
on dinner?

Whatever you like.

I know this is insane,

but I can't stop
thinking about Nori's.

I was just there.

- Today? With who?
- Nobody.

You went there
without me?

Yeah, I was hungry.

- What?
- Nothing.

- Come on, what?
- I don't know,

I just thought
that was our special place.

Well, it is.

Well?

- I went there alone, Carm.
- I know that. You said.

It just felt nice
to have something special, for us.

No kids around,
without my parents...

We can go
if you want.

No, no,
don't be silly.

Are you sure?

How's the car?

(FOOTBALL GAME

Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
Hey!

(DOORBELL RINGS)

- Carmela.
- Ginny, hi.

I tried calling,
but I kept getting the machine.

Is everything all right?
Truth is,

sometimes I don't answer the phone.
Goddamn creditors.

I was in the neighborhood. I thought
I might kidnap you for a spa date.

Well, that's
a nice surprise.

I thought maybe we'd drive up there,
maybe stop at Occitane.

Is that new?

Oh, the car?
Yes, yes.

Porsche Cayenne,
like the pepper.

It's beautiful, Carm.

- (MUFFLED DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
- VITO: Five minutes.

At no incline. Then I switch to full
uphill for my cardio.

I was telling Tony
he should come with me.

- Do him good.
- It ain't just aesthetics, either.

God forbid he ever has
a heart attack.

- (KNOCKS ON DOOR)
- SILVIO: Yeah.

Vito, you're in
the handicapped spot.

- That fucking guy is here again?
- The man's a former judge.

- Hey, listen to this.
- (DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

"If your nose runs
and your feet smell...

you're built
upside down."

Funny.
(CHUCKLES)

Hey, by the way,
your Florida thing...

Tony asked me
to speak to you...

that's a no-go.

- What?
- Can't be accommodated.

You're part of the team.

- But I just did that thing.
- That's not my department.

Well, can I talk
to Tony at least?

I wouldn't bother him.

He's out on the new boat.

Does he think
I'm gonna talk about shit up here,

with what I've done,
what I just did?

(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

It's not so silly
when you think about it.

I'm a top earner now.

It's not out of the realm
of possibility

that I could be the boss
of this family one day.

I mean, God forbid
Tony ever gets...

cancer, coronary,
something like that.

(PHONE RINGING)

- Yeah.
- Hey, big brother.

Listen, I know I was supposed to sit
with Uncle Jun' tonight,

but Tom just called
from location.

Apparently,
some smoke effect went awry

and he inhaled
noxious chemicals.

Well, go. Go.

(RETCHES)

The thing is,
Uncle Jun' doesn't want me to.

He's exceptionally agitated
today and he's been nauseous.

Well, did you call Janice?
I mean, her or Bobby should go.

- I'm all the way out here on a boat.
- They can't do it.

- What do you mean can't?
- I don't know.

She didn't elaborate.
It didn't seem like she wanted to.

- Aw, God damn it!
- I'm sorry, Tony.

All right, all right,
all right.

- (SIGHS)
- (BEEPING)

(DIALING)

Mother...

(TOY TRAIN ENGINE
BELLOWING)

I swear to God, I'm throwing
all this shit right in the garbage!

It's my hobby, Janice.
Why do you gotta belittle it?

Will you just
get ready please?

- You go. I gotta work.
- You can do your collections tomorrow!

I'm on a schedule!
It don't work that way.

This is why you can't
watch Uncle Jun'?

I told you last week,
we have Nica's preschool meeting.

- She's 15 months old.
- No one was more competitive

than your wife when
it came to this stuff with A.J.

A lot of good it did.

This child... constantly wanting
the breast.

He doesn't want to be alone.
He says he doesn't feel good.

The school, they need to meet both
parents if it's an intact family.

So call the girl,
the nurse.

Miss Trinidad? Right. Every time
I call, a different person answers.

I'll go, Ton'.
I'm on it.

Fuck it! You wanna get something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

You were the one
who was opposed to assisted living.

You and I
are gonna talk.

You didn't have
to wear your fucking hat.

Shit.

So how about you?
Are you dating?

With my hours
at the body shop?

Ladies.
Dessert was on me.

Thank you, Artie.

It's nice to see you two
patch things up.

- So silly.
- I'm not even sure what happened.

Me and Tony didn't speak
for months.

You pick up
right where you left off.

Did Charmaine tell you?
We're getting back together.

No, she didn't
mention it.

- That's terrific!
- We're both very happy.

Jesus, will you
hear me out at least?

We buy here. Livingston,
North Caldwell maybe.

- Right near Tony.
- Oh.

Better schools,
new friends.

We got the money, baby.
$2 million.

It's not
the same, Gene.

(SIGHS) It could be better.

The summers down there...
we were ignoring the negatives.

It's fucking brutal
with the bugs.

Tony and Silvio,
all they understand is appearances.

We'll buy a new car.
It'll raise my profile.

You watch,
I'll make captain.

I found this
under our son's bed.

Florida's any better?
It's the drug capital of the world.

Look, for Tony to...

Tony, Tony!
Why don't you kill him?

- Put a bullet in his fucking head.
- I can't do that.

What, you think I don't know
that you've done it before?

- He's the boss, Deanne.
- The boss of what?

He's a piece of shit!

Is our life that bad?

It's your money.
Your aunt's money.

It has nothing
to do with him.

There's this wonderful
Jersey contemporary

I want you to see with me.
It's cathedral ceilings.

You'll fall in love.

There's nothing
I can say.

Colonel Dax, you're
a disappointment to me.

You have spoiled
the keenness of your mind

by wallowing
in sentimentality.

You really did want
to save those men

and you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

You're an idealist

and I pity you as I would
the village idiot.

We're fighting a war, Dax,
a war that we've got to win.

Those men didn't fight,
so they were shot.

I apologize for not being
entirely honest with you.

I apologize for not revealing
my true feelings.

I apologize, sir,
for not telling you...

- Hello.
- Who's that?

- It's me.
- You can go to hell

before I apologize to you
now or ever again!

- What are you doing?
- I lost my uppers.

- Probably upstairs.
- God fuck it all!

Relax, will ya?
We'll find them.

The phone keeps ringing,
and then they hang up.

It's probably salespeople.

- I know who it is!
- Pussy Malanga, I know.

We'll get J. Edgar Hoover
right on it.

I'll tell you what, you go upstairs,
you look for your teeth.

I'm gonna fix you
something to eat, okay?

I had a banana
in there.

All right,
we'll find that too.

I got it.

We buy a vacation place
in Florida, a condo.

It's not the same.

I make another run
at Tony

- six months, a year from now.
- A year?

- You can go ahead even.
- What?

And let me tell you,
a year, two years from now

everything could be
different.

Tony could be gone.

(PHONE RINGING)

- I, uh...
- Go ahead.

His master's voice.

Yeah?

Now?!

(EXHALES)

(AIRPLANE ENGINES
HUMMING DISTANTLY)

- Gene, this is Agent Sanseverino.
- Hello.

Where've you been, buddy?
Haven't heard from you lately.

Busy, you know.
My kid has some problems.

That's rough.

The thing is, Geno,
you gotta keep in touch with me.

You have a chance to help
in more important ways.

- What do you mean?
- We lost a major asset this month.

- The point is...
- Was Ray Curto a cooperator?

The way things are shaping up,
you're a designated hitter.

Look, Ron,

we've talked
about Florida, okay?

Gene, that's not
gonna happen.

Here among your friends
is where you're useful.

I told you, you tell your bosses,
I'd come back for any trial.

Florida's just one of those things
you gotta let go.

Okay.

So, the Feast of St. Joe's,
Tony gave some rulings on the unions.

Were any made guys
from New York there?

(SIGHS)

(GRUNTING, GAGGING)

(SWING BAND PLAYING
ON STEREO)

(SWING BAND CONTINUES
ON STEREO)

10 minutes, Uncle Jun'.

Who's down there?

Artie Shaw.
10 minutes.

Don't go anywhere.

I'm not.
I'm right here.

(MUTTERING)

(WOMAN SINGING
JAZZ STANDARD)

You got any wine?

(SPEAKS ITALIAN)
Malanga!

- (GUNSHOT)
- (SCREAMS)

(GRUNTING)

(WOMAN CONTINUES SINGING)

(PANTING)

(GRUNTING, PANTING)

(LAUGHS) Well, here I am.

Is that a Porsche?

Had my eye on it for months.
It's a gift from Tony.

I thought about a Boxster,
but I don't know.

The 'Vette felt
more like me.

(BEEPS) - You
bought that yourself?

The accountant says I'm better off
owning it outright.

(BEEPS)

Uncle Jun'!

Call 911!

Uncle Jun'!

(WATER BOILING)

Uncle Jun'!

(WEAKER)
Uncle Jun'!

(DIAL TONE)

(LINE RINGING)

(MUTTERS)

911, where is
the emergency?

911, where is
the emergency?

(WATER BOILING)

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

Number six is Khaibit:
the Shadow, Memory,

your whole past conditioning from this
and other lives.

Number seven is Sekhu:
the Remains.

Tony, hey.
I tented the bulbs.

Oh, good.

I've been meaning
to ask you...

The Sacrimonis...

I've been doin' his yard
over there a year and change now...

And?

I guess
what I'm asking is

how much longer do I have
to keep doin' this on the arm?

Oh, so it was okay
when we were gettin' you

out of your Feech La Manna problem, huh?

But suddenly...
short fuckin' memory?

I appreciate that, Tony.
Don't get me wrong, but...

You're a selfish prick, Sal.
You know that?

Her husband's in jail.
Don't you think this is the time

when Mrs. Sacrimoni
needs you the most?

The federal prosecutors
and myself have been told

to clear our calendars
for the next five months.

So trial is upon us.

And the feds have reached

a complete accounting
of your worth.

"The vintage Wurlitzer"?

They go through
my fuckin' sock drawer?

They shot a video
the day of your arrest.

They even tracked down
the 180 grand

in Boca Raton
under your father's name.

They estimate
your net worth at $5 million...

While Ginny lives
on scraps.

...between your cash
and portfolios

with Fidelity and Vanguard,

your 401k and severance parachute
from Essany Scaffolding,

condo in Deal Beach
at 450,

Maserati, Ginny's Yukon,

and the house and its contents
valued at a million two.

Is this all part
of your plan, Ron...

make me so fuckin' depressed
that I hang myself?

It's my obligation to raise the idea
again of cooperating.

Flip?

Let me explain something
to you again, Ron,

but differently.

Being a rat,
where I'm comin' from,

that's like asking a person
where you're comin' from

to become a fuckin' Nazi.

I don't wanna hear
that shit again.

Good.

Because, frankly,
I don't represent turncoats.

'Cause it would kill
your practice.

Huh...

What happened
to my stuffed pork loin?

You ever hear
of knocking?

I ordered it special.

You had them send it up
to Carmela?

You get
what you pay for.

Hi.

She's your little twin.

Bacala's got
no fuckin' genes at all.

You never miss a chance
to shit on him, do you?

I'm joking, come on.
She looks like you, that's all.

I don't know why you
just can't admit

that you blame us
that you got shot.

Unfortunately, I have
only myself to blame.

"Unfortunately." Oh.

So obviously you'd like
to blame somebody.

I have only myself
to blame.

You don't blame me
for the shooting?

Well you fuckin'
blame me for something!

- Jan, the baby.
- You know, marrying the boss's sister...

usually it's a step up.

But you keep your
goddamn foot on our necks.

You punish Bobby
because he's my husband.

- Will you stop, huh?
- To be his age and not to be a captain?

Oh, now I see what this
little visit's all about.

He works so hard
for you,

and what does he get?

Merciless ridicule...

about his weight,
about his model railroading.

- He's a grown man!
- Oh, but it's okay for Neil Young.

He owns Lionel!

Domenica! Take care
of your things.

I don't know
where it comes from...

all your anger,
your hate for me.

I'm your sister.

I know
I'm not perfect.

I know
I annoy people.

I think about you

lying in that
hospital bed...

I cried for you.

I sat with you.

I know it.

And I appreciated it.

But we both know

no matter
how much help I gave,

you'd still be here
fuckin' complainin'.

Oh my God,

there's nothing holding us together
but DNA.

I'm askin' what else you got
besides slot machines?

That single-deck
blackjack?

Okay, thanks.

I can't believe this.

- I was...
- Is this what you're doing all day?

I knew there was a reason you wouldn't
let me read the galleys of your book.

I'm doing research.

I guess Rocky Marciano
was a fan of the greyhounds

'cause I found a fucking
trifecta box ticket in my trash!

Hold up.

It's complicated shit.

Are you even
a sportswriter?

I mean, here we are talking about taking
the next step in this relationship.

I ask you to share my home and you
can't even be straight with me.

Fuck this.
Nice knowing you, Vincent.

Jimbo, come on.

I'm not
a writer, okay?

I'm not
from Scottsdale

and the car's
not my sister's.

I'm actually
from New Jersey

- I knew it.
- Some shit went down.

I had to leave...

my home,
my contracting business...

my wife, my kids.

Are you drunk?
It's not even 11:00!

You think it's easy?

I miss home so bad
my heart's a fuckin' lump.

I'm barely holding
together,

stuck in the sticks,
running out of money

and now this?

You think I was
looking for you?

A wife and kids.
Of course.

I've been divorced
for a few years.

Where do they think
you are?

You can never
tell anybody, ever.

I'm not
fuckin' around here.

I was married too,
remember?

I was only gonna say
you need some money,

you worked construction...
maybe I can help you get work.

I know some people could always
use a good handyman.

Happy birthday!

- Mwah!
- Stop blubbering. It's a party.

You think we'd let you
turn 50 alone?

- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

Hi, Sal!

God, he's such a mope.

The girls come around
enough, and that helps.

Allegra's a little bitchy,
but it's painful for her to be here.

Plus she thinks
I resent her happiness.

- Newlyweds.
- She's probably freaked out

that she's not
happier herself.

Ginny, that kitchen...

and this room,
the light...

Not his decision
to make.

I'm running that shop,
not him.

My days are
completely full.

- I shouldn't.
- Hey, it's your birthday.

- Yeah.
- I've always loved this place.

It reminds me
of the Palladian villas I saw in Italy.

Thank you.
Sometimes I forget.

And it's embarrassing.
I spend most of my time upstairs.

- Wellbutrin.
- I wish there was a pill...

John in that place?

Of course I can't say
my pain's worse than anybody's.

Yeah, yeah.
We're both grownups.

I'd rather go
with my own instincts.

Your feet are like
fuckin' icicles.

Hands too?

Dinner was good.

Shh.

Hey, I found
a woodland mountain.

27" peak,
clump foliage and snow.

- Bobby.
- I'm listening, okay?

Where are you going?

Rafe's brother's making a music video.
They got dry ice.

Where's your helmet?

Check out
the Moe and Joe action.

Hey, you know what?
Let's do a race,

the Polar Express one.

We could trash it.

I can't.

I see the gray cloud
hanging around your head.

Where's Prince Albert?
Still sleeping?

Who knows?

Tony, I've been very patient with you
because you've been sick.

You were going to talk
to the building inspector.

- My spec house.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

I sent Little Paulie.

They made some headway
with the supervisor,

but the other guy,
the inspector, he's a piece of work.

Next I'll get Sil
on it.

Gotta pay a visit to the Montville
building department.

To what end?

I've been promising Carm
I'd lean on this inspector.

Completely went
out of my head.

The guy's name is,
uh, Ron Senkowski.

Ginny Sack's brother,
Anthony.

Ah, the lord
of the lenses.

Actually we just started
carrying these.

The newest
Cross pen.

Ah...

a rollerball.

You want
a classic fountain?

Nah.
Have a seat.

So how's your
brother-in-law?

John's fuckin'
made of steel.

I was told
"your ears only."

Oh, that's why
he didn't get a pen?

- No, I...
- He's fuckin' with you, Anthony.

Johnny's a silent partner

in this heavy equipment
leasing thing in New Orleans.

Good. FEMA's down there
handing out Krugerrands in buckets.

He said post-Katrina you had some
knowledge of business in the area.

Well, let me say this...

Dick Cheney for President...
of the fuckin' universe.

On account of John's, uh,
liquidity problems...

the asset freeze...

he'd love you
to contact these brothers...

the owners...
and turn it into cash.

Me?

Says Phil Leotardo
shouldn't be involved.

Just know John's
asking as a friend.

And obviously
there's a finder's fee.

What the hell's this,
a siesta?

What?
I wasn't sleeping.

I was resting my hips.

I'm supposed
to have surgery.

Am I early?

- What do you mean?
- Dinner.

I am interviewing
a new contractor for my spec...

Bill DeGillio.

He built
the Sacrimoni house.

He did decent workmanship.
Ginny says he works for a price.

- So?
- Well, your sister loves that house.

She said it reminded her
of a "villa in Italy."

What, is he
coming here now?

I picked up a couple of sandwiches
from Italianissimo.

You know, your father
did this house

and it was more than
decent workmanship.

You think about replacing
him before you rush off

into something that could maybe cost
you a lot more of your time.

Why do you suddenly care
so much about my dad?

And I like that she has
these little projects

and charities,
what-have-you.

Makes her happy,

keeps her busy.

But...

even in bed she's
a million miles away.

Sounds like you want
to encourage her with this house

as long as it doesn't interfere
with your life.

Carmela
and me, we...

we came
to an understanding

when we reconciled...

I would financially
back her spec house

and she would have more
of a don't-ask-don't-tell policy

towards my work

and my recreational life
outside of the home.

But you tell me
there hasn't been

much recreating
since the shooting.

No, and that's okay.

Fucking Janice came
to visit me at work.

That doesn't
happen often.

Well, she shops
for meat there.

We get it free.

And by the way, again,
if you ever need a roast

or any specialty
kind of cut,

please just ask.

My dad used to
drop us off there

when he had
to run errands.

We'd go into the back
and we'd steal cigarettes,

play house, you know,
shit like that.

Anyway, she was
all upset.

She said that
I was mean to her

and her husband.

- What did you say?
- Well, it doesn't matter,

'cause she's right.

I love it when I can
take a shit on her

and her husband.

What's that about?

Even when they told me
that Uncle Jun' might need diapers,

I thought about Bobby
having to change him...

I still get
a kick out of it.

It makes Bob seem weak?

Your sister too?

These are acts
of kindness.

Janice only does
"acts of Janice."

Trust me.

You two have never
really gotten along?

Well, not never.
She was my older sister.

I thought
she was pretty cool.

And she gave it back
to my mother.

Let me tell you,
that was some heroic shit.

Because she
defended you.

Please. It was
every man for himself.

I remember one time
my parents left her in charge.

Go ahead.

Well, she stood in the hallway
and she tape-recorded

me and Barb
having a fight.

And she held that cassette tape
over my head for a month.

Fuckin' extortion.

Made me make her bed,
get her shit.

Did she do that
to Barbara too?

Well, that's not
the fuckin' point.

I've been coming here...
I don't know... five years now

and you still don't understand what
it means to tape somebody in my family?

You still don't fucking
get this?

Listen, as far
as that thing goes...

the coffee
with the chicory...

- What the fuck is that?
- Oh shit.

I suck at talking like this, John.
I'm sorry.

Our friend with
the stomach.

In town
or near home?

Your neighbor.

- A.S...
- Yeah, all right.

Just say, "the thing
I asked you to do."

"The coffee with
the fuckin' chicory."

- Is he gonna get it for me?
- Yes.

Bad news is he wants
10 cups for himself.

Not seven.

All right. Done.

Did you pick up the birthday cake
for Gin with the marzipan flowers?

The stuff behind
the pool?

No, an actual
fuckin' cake.

It's her birthday.

- What are you doing?
- I'm comin' with you.

Okay, but stand clear.

- What's going on?
- Pastor heard water running,

went down, basement's flooded and
they're trying to shut down the pipe.

But the pastor's trapped,
standing on a milk crate.

- Anybody go get him?
- There's an arcing wire hanging.

These assholes skipped a conduit
when they remodeled.

I spent years
as a contractor.

Electrical is where
I got started.

Way to go, Vince!

What the fuck
did I tell you?

Fuck you. The guy was gonna
get cooked.

What are you trying
to be, a big man?

- Back the fuck off!
- What the fuck, Jim?

Boys, boys,
calm down.

Okay, now let's cut the bullshit,
get the water turned off

and pump out
the damn basement.

I gotta say, I thought you guys
were morons for doing this shit,

but now I can see
it's a fuckin' rush.

You should join the department.
That would be good.

We could use
another moron.

Of course it's a commitment,
firefighting.

Every day
it's there.

You have to have
a passion, really.

I've got these bad hips.
Supposed to have surgery.

Well, this is all
bullshit talk anyway.

You're probably gonna
forget this craphole

the minute you hear
from your publisher.

Hey, darts! Five bucks a point.
Who's in?

Nah. It's almost
midnight.

Where the fuck
you guys going?

- Let's play some poker.
- Hey, you did great.

Back where I come from
the night's just startin'.

Good night.

Good week, even with
the fuckin' Dolphins.

Night, boss.

Get his joint.

You know
who the fuck I am?

You beat, nigga.
What?

You come out the bookie's?
You a winner or a loser?

You're making
a big mistake.

Damn! Three Gs.

You got what you want.
Please don't. I got kids.

Yo, man,
look at his mouth.

Look at his fuckin' mouth!

Fuck this. Do him.
Do him now.

Jesus, no. Please.
No, please.

Shit!

What the fuck are you doing, man?
Why you pull that trigger?

Well, according to John,
the retail value of Bayou Leasing

is around six mil.
Seem about right?

- Between five and six.
- Let's do this again, chere.

Well, you're gonna have to find a buyer
and deliver John's half to me

and in about 30 days, give you a chance
to get a couple of bidders.

- His half?
- Yeah.

I don't think
that's up for debate.

Had you controlled
your fuckin' football jones

we wouldn't even have
no fuckin' silent partner.

That man floated me
50 grand. 50.

Next thing I know he's
buying in for half a fucking million.

Look at him sitting there
like they don't do this shit every day.

You took John's loan.
He helped you expand.

Now it's time
to cash in.

Listen, Mr. Soprano, that's what
I've been saying all along.

You know, you two
don't seem like brothers.

In-laws. He married
my little sis.

15 years
of womanly company

but I had to come all the way
to New Jersey to get truly fucked.

You know, I'm doing this
as a favor to John.

And I don't need
another headache.

So do we got
a problem here?

No, sir.
I'm buying a boat.

Now you fancy yourself
a businessman.

Would you sell now with all that money
pouring into New Orleans?

John Sacrimoni
asked me to.

Well, we're
very different people.

Thanks.

No belligerence.

We kindly remain in...

...now shake hands and come
out fighting. I thank you.

- Ahem... yeah.
- Heard about Bobby Bacala?

Yeah, my sister called
with the breaking news.

That fuckin' part
of Newark...

even the cops
don't go there no more.

So you heard
everything.

Doctors said the slug blew bits
of sidewalk into the eye there.

Yeah, I heard.

- But they're optimistic.
- Right, doctors.

It's always good news
till it ain't.

Speaking of that, whatever the fuck
happened to you

with the prostate?

Well actually, T,
I've been dealing with some shit.

Cancer, to tell
you the truth.

What the fuck, Paulie?

It was early.
Maybe I caught a break.

Still encapsulated.

I'm taking a course
of radiation

to knock the PSA back
into the single digits.

Well, are you all right?
The hair and shit?

Heh, knock wood, eh?

I must have done
good things in my life.

Yeah.

All right.

The cancer...

your ears only.

Absolutely.

You hear
about Bobby?

- Yeah.
- Should've seen him.

Put a patch over his eye
like Hathaway.

He was
really rattled.

Still, let's face it, it was kind
of stupid to be out there that late.

Ton', cops don't even
go there no more.

Anyway, Bobby's vision's
fucked now.

They're hoping
the repair will take.

He could be a candidate
for a cornea transplant.

He should be a candidate
for a brain transplant.

To his credit,

all he was thinking about
was straightening out for the week.

Fuck that "honor
and loyalty" shit.

It was
a maneuver, Carlo,

'cause he knew it was
his own fucking fault.

What?

Don't give me
that look.

Including
the wife's IRA

and his pension,

we'd go
for 240 months.

20 years and 90%
of his assets?

Makes trial seem like
a risk worth taking.

Have you seen
the discovery evidence?

You came to us.

My client insisted
the house is off-limits.

He wants his wife
provided for.

So what do you have
in mind?

Renee, again, the shit
that has nothing to do with him:

the house, her IRA,
the Yukon,

the deed
on the daughter's condo.

- And 12 years.
- For a conspiracy to commit murder?

Get back to me
when you're sober, Ron.

The Eagles absolutely
no good here.

Not sure even seven will,
but the Eagles will go for it.

McNabb back to pass.
He has his receiver...

It's broken.
Wanna switch?

Oh, no, no.
I'm good.

Carm just called. She's still
getting her folks in the car.

Where's Barb
and Tom?

I asked them
to bring wine.

We'll see
how long that takes.

Did you take
the Vicodin?

Once again, they'll have
the ball.

They'll take over
from their own 25 yard line.

Manning has had success throwing
the ball, Tiki Barber running the ball...

Giants, huh?

Fucking blowing 'em out.

As long as they
don't beat the spread.

- Where are you going?
- Out.

The Giants
are kicking ass here.

I'm going to Eric's
to watch the Chargers.

- What channel's that on?
- Some people aren't too cheap

to buy the satellite package.

Sit down.
This is a Giants house.

- I hate the fucking Giants.
- Ho! What'd we say about that language?

AJ didn't have
to come to Sunday dinner.

AJ has a job.
Do you wanna go get a job?

Go ahead.

But first go get
your last report card

and read it out loud
to everybody.

Oh... went right out
of Shockey's hands...

No? I thought so.

Now go finish
your Spanish report before dinner.

Set the table,
honey.

...tough time on that one.

He certainly doesn't mind
taking a lick or two here...

My brother-in-law
almost got his fucking eye put out.

Some fucking
crackhead animals.

- That is terrible.
- Yeah, it is, but...

Jesus Christ, it's one thing
after another with her family.

You mean
the bad luck?

Or do you feel like
somehow they deserve it?

I don't know, but...

fucking Janice
attracts drama.

She creams
over the misery.

Does she remind you
of anyone?

When we were growing up,
she had something, you know?

She...

she had beautiful hair
and she was built and...

Guys her age were always
buying me ice cream,

giving me baseball cards,
kissing my ass

to get in good
with her.

Sounds a little
like jealousy.

No guy wants his sister
to be the town pump.

You weren't
sexually threatened?

Oh, Jesus Christ, will you make up
your fucking sick mind?

First it's my mother.
Now I wanna fuck my sister?

It's normal,
not sick,

that she functioned

as the focus of your
early sexual feelings.

In fact, it was
probably mutual.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

You describe her
as "built."

All those afternoons in your father's
office, "playing house."

Whatever your bond,

what happened
between then and now?

She fought it out
with my mother and finally took off

first minute
she could.

What if you
had taken off?

Well, that never
would have happened

'cause I wasn't like that.
I did what I was told.

Your father's son.

Yeah, that's right.

And all that went with it.

That's right.
All the success and the money.

But beyond that, what else
did you inherit?

I'll tell you
what I inherited...

my mother.

Janice got laid.
She took off.

She laughed
at all this shit.

Then the trip's over
and she's back and she's one of us.

And she wants
her piece.

Well, let me tell you,
she gets nothing!

'Cause I got the scars!
So it's mine!

What are you doing?

Cooking.
How was the call?

It was nothing.
It was a laundromat on Webster.

Thought I'd make a little dinner
like we do back home.

We got pasta badan...

macaroni
and potatoes...

real peasant food.

We got
a little salad.

Then pork chops

and vinegar peppers.

I fuckin' miss
this shit, I gotta say.

I can see why.

You gotta wait
for that.

- What?
- Nothing.

I just realized...

the other night when you cut
the power to the church...

- I was a real dick.
- Yeah.

But it was only because
I was worried, you know.

Something could've
happened to you.

That's a nice thing.

You don't understand.

Vincent...

I love you.

I love you,
"johnnycakes."

10:30, gotta be.

Hour and a half,
lunch.

The halfway
fuckin' point.

Don't look at your watch.
Not yet.

Save it.
Treat yourself.

10 to 11:00,

maybe five of.

Don't look.

Think of those sandwiches
Jim made.

When you've eaten
the last bite,

this fuckin' day
is halfway gone.

11:30, has to be.

Look at the angle
of the sun.

Maybe even
a quarter to 12:00.

Okay, look.

Now.

Fuck me!

Vincent?

Jiggle the toilet after.

Vincent!

Vincent!

Moment of truth?

It's still
up to the judge,

but they're gonna
recommend 15 years

and $4.1 million.

You keep the home,

the 45k in equity from the girls'
variable life insurance,

and Ginny's IRA
which is worth about 110 grand.

- And?
- That's it.

Or go to trial.

15 fucking years.

You're a young man.

In 15 years,
you'll be 67.

The golden years.

Grandkids.

Do I have to do
the allocution?

You know the allocution
is always part of it,

practically
the whole point.

I'll take it.

That IRA of Ginny's...

she worked the tie counter
at Wanamaker's.

That's where we met.

No Mocha Mix?

I was looking forward
to fresh blueberries this morning

but Mom hasn't shopped.

What are you doing
hanging around here?

Finn asked me into the city
to see a movie,

but I didn't want to go
and I told him he could go

if he wanted to
and he went.

- Really?
- Yeah, really.

Don't give it
to me, okay?

I know.
I'm sorry.

It's just...

he doesn't
fucking get it.

I don't even know
what he's thinking lately.

He spends more time
at Jeffrey's apartment than with me.

Come on.

You know who's really good
to talk to about stuff?

Your mother.

This whole year off together,
I've seen such a selfish side.

"I'll come back early."
He said that. He actually said that.

All right, well...

maybe he thought
you wanted him to go.

I mean, you did say it.

Yeah, or maybe
subconsciously he's done.

We sleep together
at Jeffrey's apartment,

and Finn sleeps
on the floor half the time

and I'm right there
for him.

Okay, well, honey, when you're living
in sin with some guy,

- you can't expect...
- Living in what?!

Jesus Christ.

You should talk to your mother
about this shit!

Did you go see that guy
at the building department yet?

I was going to go on Friday
when the schedules are looser.

Well, don't.

Fuck!

Whoa, whoa...
whoa, whoa, whoa!

Jesus.
Are you all right?

What the fuck are you doing
parked out here?

Excuse me?
I'm getting my mail.

You're driving
like a maniac.

My God. How come your airbag
didn't go off?

Somebody took it out.
They sold it.

Sold it? Who would do
such a thing?

Look, I'm really sorry.
I was in a rush.

So you admit
it was your fault.

Yeah, absolutely.

Let me get the damages here
and I'll be on my way.

Mmm, we should file
a police report.

- You got a phone?
- No, seriously.

What do you say,
500 bucks?

Look, I took
the worst of it.

And then you call your insurance on me?
No, thank you.

I'm not gonna
do that. Six?

Look, I don't want
an argument here.

My place is just
up the drive there.

We'll call the police.
They'll come right out.

Turn on
your hazards.

Let me get
my registration.

Motherfucker!

Fucking
cocksucking cunt!

Fuck!

Tony! Hey!

I was just coming
to see you.

I'm on my way home.

It's just I haven't
heard from you.

Uh, the fuckhead
from fuckland?

- Yeah.
- It's gonna be too much effort.

Well, John was really
counting on this.

And Ginny
needs the money,

for Allegra,
for the family.

What?

He changed
the terms.

What, a bigger piece
for his fat mouth?

No, smaller,
actually.

But it's the house.

He wants you to unload it
to his sister

at a reduced price.

Half, actually.

But the New Orleans
thing...

he'll knock 2% off
his finder's fee

and he'll make sure
those pricks sell.

I guess beggars
can't be choosers.

And the worst part is

I gotta sell the idea
to Ginny somehow.

Gab took me
to her Moroccan tile place.

By the way...
I don't wanna pester you...

Did Sil make
a visit?

Yeah, I meant
to tell you.

He didn't have any luck
with that inspector.

Really? You're kidding.

No. Sorry about that.

Did he bring him
a gift?

Cash.

So how hard
did he lean on the guy?

Carm, Sil knows
his business.

Look, I know
you're disappointed, but...

I just gotta
put this out there...

just sell it.
You'll get a good price.

30% return
on your investment.

So that's it?
You... you just give up?

I don't think I ever
heard that before.

Look, the guy said no.

How far do you wanna
push this thing?

Oh, those sons
of bitches.

All my planning
for a fucking year!

And they let people
build those fucking monstrosities!

You wanna go out to dinner
tonight at least?

Why not put
a runner here

or a large diameter
round Oriental?

It could cut down
on the echo and warm it up.

Well, I'd rather we spend on
what we have to right now.

Window treatments.

Mr. Sacrimoni,
during the time period

beginning approximately
January 1, 1996, through today,

were you employed by
or associated with

the New York faction of an organized
crime family of La Cosa Nostra?

Yes.

Sacrimoni allocuted
in federal court,

admitting at least a 10-year connection
with La Cosa Nostra.

Fucking nauseating!

Could have been worse.
He could have flipped.

Are you fucking
kidding me?

You don't ever admit the existence
of this thing. Ever.

He should have stood
trial like a man.

I did
20 fucking years.

What?

Johnny Sack
pleaded guilty.

It was just
on the radio.

He got 15 years.

Fuck!

Hey! Hold on.

Wait a fucking minute.

- Are you the owner of this vehicle?
- Yeah.

I got a spot in the garage.
I went in for a half an hour, tops.

Douchebags make
that a red zone?

This is a seizure order for all assets
belonging to John Sacrimoni.

No, no. I bought it
from his wife.

Well, if she sold it, she violated
a court order freezing his assets.

Of course she sold it.
I paid her fucking 25 grand cash.

It's going to be auctioned in May
up in Parsippany.

You like it so much,
buy it again.

This is fucking insane,
you cocksucking motherfucker!

Keep talking like that.
I'm gonna get a truck out here for you.

To think that piece of shit
was my friend once.

I hope he dies
in there.

You know
how this looks?

I wish I was on the courthouse steps
to throw acid in his face,

just to distance
myself.

Excuse me, Tony.

I've been
meaning to ask you...

I was just wondering
about the Sacrimoni place.

What about it?

Well, now that
Mr. Sacrimoni is guilty,

do you think I could maybe
take him off my route?

What the fuck
did you just say, Sal?

I don't know.

The fucking lawnmower man
just said John was guilty, T.

He pled guilty, Sal.
Okay?

Yeah, okay.

With this government,
no fucking trial.

Maybe they stuck tasers
on his balls

and beat him mercilessly
with a rubber hose.

- You ever think of that?
- No.

But of course,
it makes sense.

Don't besmirch
the man, Sal.

So about the yard...

Do you believe
this fucking guy?

You're done with that.

Come on. Let's go
check out these DVDs.

Have to take about
35-40 of them.

No gain, 2nd and 10.

Green on a roll
to the near side.

Gets it away
and has a completion...

Mead, put
the cavatell' in.

- Hey there.
- Hi.

- Where's Christopher?
- He went out to an AA meeting.

- Tony?
- Yeah.

I just wanted to say

thank you.

You're welcome.

No one's ever done
something so... so...

It's okay, Janice.
Really.

Sorry.

- Hey Tony?
- Uh-huh.

You got the wine?
We're almost ready.

Hey, what happened?

Jan.

No one knows
what goes on in my head.

What's the matter?
What happened?

She's happy...
about the house.

Oh, honey,
it's okay.

It's okay.

- Come on. You okay?
- Oh... yeah.

- You all right?
- Yeah.

New York's
classic rock Q104.3.

Good morning.
I'm Jim Kerr.

Coming up a little bit
later on the "Q"...

Half an hour,
he says.

It's a fucking hour
and a half already.

He's busy.

Enjoy the music.

I thought
you weren't coming.

You don't wanna know.

Actually, I do.

We had intel

a salafist cell
was at Newark airport

boarding somebody
onto a 767 to London.

You're right.
I don't wanna know.

We get this all the time.
Our source was either wrong

or it was done
to study our response.

Happens all the time?

What's up, my friend?

You know, my kid is
obsessed with this shit.

But we tell him he's making
a molehill out of it.

Is he right?

Hey.
Probably another hour.

Just leave it out,

All right?
I'll heat it up.

Well, then don't
leave it out.

What do you
want me to say?

You got a rough enough job
with this terrorism shit.

I'll let you get home. The
reason I called is those two arabs

I turned you on to...
well, I happened to remember

my nephew
mentioned a bank

where they had
an account...

A branch...

The Mintner First
Merchants Bank.

- You just remembered that?
- Yeah.

Thanks.

Oh, whoa...
listen,

I know you got that friend
in the Brooklyn office.

Is it possible he knows
where Phil Leotardo is?

I want to try to avoid any
more of my guys getting hurt.

I'm just saying,

If you heard anything
from your pal...

I haven't.

I figured maybe money's
sent to the Middle East.

You're overreaching.

Okay.

- See you Thursday.
- Bye.

Where are you going?
I just got here.

I'm really late meeting
Patrick in the city. Bye.

Bye-bye.

How are you doing?

She smelled
that odor too.

Your remodel
will fix all that.

Maybe it's toxic. Maybe we
shouldn't be breathing it.

It's not toxic.
The owners were, what,

90 years old?
It's piss.

I got to get home.

I'm working on it.

I went to see Sil...

And Gab.
Oh my god, Tony.

Yeah.

Are you being careful?

This kind of
bothers me.

Call me when you
get home, okay?

Okay.
Thanks.

Who is she
gonna tell?

But you should used
the back door.

I wouldn't kick her out
of bed for purging cookies.

Real funny.
We're just friends.

I know.
Nice work.

- She's a model.
- She's doing some modeling.

All right? She's a
junior in high school.

What?

She's quitting modeling
anyway.

She's tired
of being exploited.

Did you help your mother
take the carpets outside,

- put 'em in the sun?
- He did.

Uncle Bobby's funeral
is finally set

For Thursday.
And you're gonna be there.

How's that
supposed to work?

We're all on Def-Con 4,
living in separate houses

and we're gonna stand out
in the open at the cemetery?

There is always
a large FBI presence.

Unbelievable.

He was different, you know?
We forget.

When he was
with Blanca.

We commend to Almighty
god our brother Robert

and we commit his body
to its resting place...

The ceremony
just ended.

...the Lord
bless him and keep him.

The Lord make his face
shine upon him...

Every one of these things
is lemon chicken or fish.

- Look at that.
- Can I have some sauce?

- I heard cauliflower's $3.99 a pound.
- I'm not gonna have this.

Can you believe that?

Oh, pop, they got
roast pork.

Give me one.
Thanks.

- She had won "American idol. "
- No.

Jennifer Hudson?
Absolutely.

Jason G. Was the winner
of italian "American Idol. "

He could say "fuck"
more times in a sentence

than any other contestant.

Uncle Paulie,
come sit down.

Yeah, I'll sit with you.
I'm young at heart, right?

Who are you, dear?

Tara Zincone.
Bobby's niece.

My condolences.

Oh...

- Did I eat.
- It was good.

In the midst of death,
we are in life.

Or is it the other way
around?

I think it's
the other way around.

Either version, you're
halfway up the ass.

Pardon my French,
sweetheart.

- I've lost two dear friends.
- Sil's hanging on.

I lost Ma
last month.

You can take 2007 and give
it back to the indians.

- I'm sorry.
- What are you gonna do?

Life goes on.

We were discussing
"Dreamgirls. " Did you see it?

You people are fucked.
You're living in a dream.

You still sit here talking
about the fucking Oscars?

"What rough beast slouches
toward Bethlehem to be born?"

- Huh?
- "Yeets. "

- A.J.
- Yeats?

The world...
don't you see it?

Bush let
Al Qaeda escape...

- Ho!
- ... in the mountains.

Then he has us invade
some other country.

Let's join up, go kill
some fucking terrorists.

It's more noble than watching
these jack-off fantasies on tv

of how we're
kicking their ass.

It's like, America...

- What about it?
- This is still where people come

to make it.
It's a beautiful idea.

And then what
do they get? Bling?

And come-ons for shit they
don't need and can't afford?

You're all over the place. I don't
know what you're trying to say.

He's saying the framus
intersects with ramistan

approximately
at the paternoster.

Julius, what do I
have to do?

What do I have to say
to get you out of here?

Give me a chance.
Give me first dibs at this...

This television series
thing, or whatever it is.

Let me do the
pilot, please.

Julius, my boy,
sit down.

Julius, I'm not a hard man.
I'm not a mean man...

Tell you right now,
it's light.

... but the television industry
today is looking for talent.

They're looking
for quality.

They're preoccupied
with talent and quality,

And a writer is
a major commodity.

You know, this situation
ain't all bad.

I haven't had a green
vegetable in over a week.

We can't even go down
to the pork store?

- We gotta hang around here all day doing nothing.
- Baciagalup.

- Who does he belong to?
- He just showed up during the big storm.

Already caught a mouse
down the cellar.

A lot of my customers giving
their action to New York.

Power vacuum,
they're taking advantage.

Oh.

- The fuck you come in that way for?
- Sorry.

We're gonna meet Paulie
down at the hospital,

visit Sil.
You wanna come?

Nah, I got...

shit I gotta do.
My daughter...

Scratching plaintively
on a closed door.

Mr. Julius Moomer,
a would-be writer...

Yesterday it was
his gout.

This is New York's
famous little Italy.

It once covered over
40 square blocks

But has now been reduced to
one row of shops and cafes.

Hello.

It's me.

Where are you?
Are you close?

Let's do it
over the phone.

No word yet.

No one knows
where our friend is.

It's not that there's no word,
it's that there's no progress.

Nobody's taking
this lightly, Phil.

He should have been
done first.

They thought they'd find
them both at the strip joint.

I've heard this
already.

I know you're
disappointed, Phil.

I can hear it
in everything you say.

Fuckin'- a
I'm disappointed.

I'm thinking.

- Come on in, check it out.
- I don't know.

- Maybe...
- What?

Are you talking
about reaching out?

We can't go back. Are you
out of your fucking mind?

- No, I know.
- Then what did you say it for?

I didn't, Phil.
You did.

Listen, kid,

When this is over
we're gonna sit down,

- me and you.
- I hope so.

I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

I said I hope...

"Ferrara's. "

- Want a pastry?
- I need to watch my weight.

I need to snag
another husband.

You're the only one
who realized that's a joke.

You had to grow up
in our family.

That dig you made about me giving
guys head under the boardwalk?

He took it so seriously,
Bobby.

Anyway,

Thank you
for being here.

So what happens now?

Well, Robert's already said he
wants to go live with his aunt.

- What about sophia?
- Nica is my daughter.

She's very much
into her older sister.

Sophia's out of her mind if she
thinks she's getting out of this house.

Is that a joke? 'Cause
that one even got by me.

You know,
five, six years ago

When Johnny Sack
bought this house,

this was all
cornfields here.

I'd like to give it
a shot with Bobby's kids.

Bobby would want it.

I put in a lot of effort
with Sophia...

Baking together... I think
we actually have a bond.

I've had therapy.
I'm a good mother.

I put Ma and all her
warped shit behind me.

Good.

Not that I get
any thanks for it.

You know you could form
a new nuclear family.

You bring
Harpo down here...

It's a big place.

Harpo changed
his name.

He's Hal now.

Janice...

Well, you need anything,
you know I'm minutes away.

- Yeah.
- Multiple calls

traced back to a payphone
in Oyster Bay, Long Island.

What?
Oh. Oh, uh...

- Where's the phone at exactly?
- Gas station, most likely.

- Gas station?
- He's lammed out.

He may not be able to put his
hands on a clean cell phone.

All right, listen,
thanks. Really...

All right.

You kept telling me
this guy is good.

It's amazing it was written so long ago.

It's, like,
about right now.

This could be
a mistake.

I know.

We're good friends.

Yeah.

Oh, wait.

Holy shit.

Oh my god.

Go!

Oh, Christ.
I parked in leaves!

Wow.

At least my gas tank
was practically empty.

How many fucking times
have I told you:

It's an S.U.V., watch
where you park off-road?

The catalytic converter
and the dry vegetation!

I didn't see
the leaves.

You can grill fucking
steaks on that converter!

I told you!

If there was children
playing in those leaves,

- You'd have run them over?
- I guess.

Oh, you're gonna
get cute now?

- I was just answering her question.
- Dad, he wasn't being funny.

You mind your own goddamn business
unless you want some of this too.

- Mr. Fat Mouth.
- What did you say?

What was going through your mind?

What do you want from me?
I am depressed.

I'm supposed to go around
looking for piles of leaves?

Wanna hear depressed?
$30,000 for that car.

Isn't that what
you have insurance for?

Excuse me? You're not
getting another one.

Actually, that's good.

It'll force me
to take the bus.

What?

We have to break our
dependence on foreign oil.

- Cafe Napoli.
- George, it's Anthony.

Your fucking
ears must be ringing.

I just left your friend,
the son, crying the blues

over the situation between you
and that outfit over there.

That's why I'm calling.

I need you to reach out
to the little guy.

He's not happy
with Phil neither.

I know.

You're not part
of that family.

You're basically retired.
Everybody trusts you.

What I'm thinking, you'd supply
a neutral location,

guarantee
everybody's safety.

I could do that.

- Hi, George.
- Hey.

They're here.
They've been patted down too.

Anybody want a water?

- No.
- No.

We started it?
We got a dead goomar

in queens and her
old Ukrainian father.

And I'm not even gonna blame Phil.

John Sacramoni,
my friend,

I'm sorry to say,
was an insecure guy.

He created
a constant tension

Within his own family
which spilled over.

Go ahead, Carmine.
George was good enough

to broker this meeting for us.
You're just gonna sit there?

It didn't have
to be this way.

We agree.
It's gone too far.

Phil, I don't know...
he's changed.

You got my word:
we'll back off.

My price is you help us
get a location on Phil.

Uh, I can't go there.

But you do
what you gotta do.

One more thing:
you hit my brother-in-law.

- So?
- This is my sister

we're talking about.

She's gotta see
something out of this.

We'll come up
with a number.

Look at all this mail.

Anybody need
some barber's scissors?

- Ton'?
- Put some next to my coat.

He was at the safe house.
We brought him over.

Get him the fuck out.

These are snakes
with fur.

The old italians
will tell you...

you can't even
put them around a baby.

They suck the breath
right out.

Well, you're the only baby
here, so we're ahead of the game.

You wanna be wearing his
fucking pelt on your head?

- I said get rid of him.
- Leave him.

He's a good guy.

No payphone.

... daughter Gloria
on the tv series...

Look, there's
a double-breasted robin.

It doesn't cost
anything to be polite.

That goes two
ways, ma'am.

... series "Maude"?

- Arthur?
- Yes, Bea Arthur.

Beatrice Arthur.

Put an x in the center
box. $300 to the pot.

And we shuffle the
categories around again.

Pat, how are you?

- Hi.
- Livia.

I'm Janice,
her daughter.

What did he say?
I can't...

Uncle Jun',

I wanna show you
something.

Bobby and my baby.

- Janice.
- No, I'm Janice.

That's my little girl.
Her name is Domenica.

Sweet as she looks, she
left my stove on on purpose,

put the flame out
with a wet dishrag.

I caught her.

Uncle Jun',

I'm afraid
I have bad news.

Bobby's dead.

The Ambassador Hotel.

Your Bobby,
Bobby Baccalieri.

I'm a widow now.

She was inveigling him.

She's after his money.

You're not even
curious about him?

He can fucking rot.

When you were
an inpatient,

You said you might try
and get a job.

I can't now
because of the car.

I need to get
a bus schedule.

The thing is,

ever since it blew up

I feel, like...

cleansed or something.

Because...

it was a polluter?

No.

I mean,
just watching it go,

that huge fireball...

You have no idea.
The heat...

My seat melted.

I had been in it
just a few seconds before.

Carlo.

Carlo.

Yeah.

T, I had a meeting down
here with Carlo this morning.

We were supposed to go see Butch
and them on a couple of items.

Carlo didn't show.

And he don't answer
his phones neither.

I'll call you back
on the prepay.

Yeah.

- What are you thinking?
- That maybe we were had.

That this fucking Butch has
taken out another ranking guy.

T?

What if he flipped?

- Who? Carlo?
- Well?

- You there?
- His kid, the imbecile...

- Jason?
- He got picked up yesterday,

Patsy told me,
for selling ecstasy.

Mead', they're gonna
be here in...

Miss Hunter!
Long time no see.

How are you,
Mrs. Soprano?

Oh my god,
when was it?

It was right around
when you quit college.

You're being kind. I was kicked
out for partying and drunk driving.

Well, I didn't want
to say, but...

Well, that was
always you.

So what are you
up to now?

I'm in my second year
of med school.

- Oh.
- Yeah.

I completed undergrad
at purchase,

Got my act together.

Yes. They're gonna
be here, Meadow.

A man took his horse
to a vet

And the vet says to him,
"Why do you have a long face?"

"A horse goes. "
There's no man.

Right right.
A horse goes to a vet.

And the vet looks at his
face and he says to him,

- "My friend... "
- A horse goes to the doctor.

The doctor says,
"Why the long face?"

Can't tell jokes.

- More Pinot Grig', Patrick?
- No, thanks.

Speaking of jokers, where's
that other son of yours today?

I didn't think
he was invited.

I just thought with all the
wedding talk, you know...

No no, really, that pal
of his, the other Jason...

I heard he ran
into some trouble,

- Carlo's Jason.
- He's a mess.

All right.

Well, he's got
no shortage of lawyers here.

Ton', Patsy needs
a refill.

- No, Ton', I'll...
- Sit down.

Of course, this one here would
only take the case for free.

That's why we want her over
at Grubman, Grubman & Curcio.

Actually, Mead' and I have
had some conversations

And we may still snag her
over at the firm

- When she's done with law school.
- No kidding?

We went out to dinner with Steven
Grubman and the subject came up.

Steven was very impressed with her
work at the poverty law center.

He even got into starting
salaries. He was talking $170.

Jesus. Sweetheart,
that's fantastic, huh?

He had had
too much Gevrey.

Don't devalue yourself.

We've got a really interesting
case right now.

We're defending
James Trefoglio,

The county commissioner,
on those corruption charges.

Is that your case,
honey?

Bid rigging.
It's got bagmen, whores.

It's fascinating.

Yeah, he does that,

Sometimes most of the day... just
stares at Chrissy's picture.

The fuck?

You know,
they're funny that way.

I had an aunt,
her cat would only sit

at the exact corners of
the table, staring at her,

or at the intersection
of two walls, staring in.

This fucking animal
is history, today!

- Pick him up.
- You pick him up.

T, you see
this shit?

Does it all the time,
he says.

- Oh yeah?
- Look at him staring at that dead kid.

Gives me
the fucking creeps.

Walden, give us
some privacy.

Yeah.

Walden... the fuck kind of
name is that for an Italian?

I was named
after Mr. Bobby Darin...

Walden Robert Cassotto.

Heh.

The Cifaretto crew... it's a fucking
Chinese fire drill over there,

Especially now that
Carlo is absent.

I know.

I want you
to skipper that thing.

- Really?
- Fucking thing is one big ATM machine.

All our construction with New
York folds right into your kick.

Yeah.

Jesus Christ,
I thought you'd be pleased.

I didn't hand you
the diagnosis of the clap.

With due respect, I'd like
to just mull it a little.

I'm no spring chicken
no more.

I don't want to have me dying on you,
leaving you worse off than before.

Oh, you with
the dead thing.

You got the arms and upper
body of a 20-year-old.

I gotta work at that.

And I had the prostate.

All right, sure.

Go ahead.

I'm a little miffled,
but yeah, sit with it.

Thanks, T.
This means everything,

Your faith in me.

In the line of duty.

But we're short-handed.

Anyway, mid-60s,

Probably used
the payphones.

We don't have payphones. Just a
couple of stations have them anymore.

Get in.

Activity...
that's good.

I can already
see a difference.

Yeah.

Gonna get
back at it myself.

Listen...

I'm gonna join the army.

What?

Did you sign any shit?

No, but this week
I will.

I gotta deal
with Rhiannon first.

Rhiannon?
What about your mother?

- Her too.
- Are you nuts?

You wanna get sent
to Iraq?

Afghanistan.

The army's probably
good for my career.

You don't have
a career.

Right.
My ultimate goal is

to qualify for
helicopter pilot training,

Afterwards go to work
for Trump or somebody,

Be their personal pilot.

I'm not even gonna tell
your mother about this.

And don't you
do nothing

Until we've had
another chance to talk.

- You hear me?
- Yes.

He's gonna join
the fucking army.

I gotta be frank,

You people got him out
of his room... great...

So he can be
cannon fodder?

I wasn't aware
of this latest plan.

Sorry.

I should have gone
before we left the house.

Still on the army thing.

On the other hand, I'm
thinking maybe he could benefit

from the training,
the discipline.

Maybe the army'd be
great for him

if there wasn't
a war going on.

Oh, I didn't tell you,
he spent $200

on a set of cds
that teach Arabic.

Jesus Christ, come on. "shish
kebab"... What else do you need to know?

He used to just veg
in front of that tv.

He says he wants
to get past the hate,

focus it only
on the terrorists.

I really can't
reveal much more.

Right.
Even though we're paying.

This whole therapy thing,
I gotta tell you...

What?

My mother was
a borderline personality.

So what?

- I don't know if you knew that.
- No.

Well, I did not have
a very happy childhood.

No?

There was little love
in the house.

He's mentioned your mother
very briefly.

A very difficult woman,

Undermining.

I tried to place her
in a retirement community

For her own good...

She turned on me
completely.

You see, I never could
please my mother.

To what do I owe this
chance to go sake bombing?

We used to have dinner
all the time.

You're gonna get married and
my chances are flying by me.

- Yeah.
- So, your brother,

our little soldier boy...

What do you think is wrong
with that googootz?

The world is
a sad, fucked-up place.

If there's so much
suffering in the world,

- Why did you go off the pediatrician bit?
- We talked about that.

You said you wanted to be
a lawyer for black people.

Oh, that's all I said?
Really?

What I said was: the state
can crush the individual.

- New Jersey?
- The government.

Specifically,
the federal government.

And what about
little babies

in the face
of meningitis?

You know what really
turned me?

Seeing the way
italians are treated.

It's like mom says. And if we can
have our rights trampled like that,

Imagine what it's like
for recent arrivals.

- Well...
- If I hadn't seen you

dragged away
all those times by the FBI

then I'd probably be
a boring suburban doctor.

Bye-bye.

Wave "bye-bye, Grandpa. "

- Bye-bye, pop-pop.
- Say "bye-bye. "

- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

I gotta make
a phone call.

I'll meet you
at the drugstore.

Tell the goddamn pharmacist
to call Dr. Iaconis.

I should get a 60-day
supply of the Plavix.

Phil! Phil!

Oh my God!

Phil!

Oh my God!
Help!

Help me!

Oh my God!
Oh my God!

My babies!
Somebody help!

Help me!
The babies!

- Somebody help me!
- Okay, okay.

Help me, please!

Oh, God, they're
locked in there!

- Oh!
- Oh shit!

- Seen metro news?
- No.

Your old beat.
Phil Leotardo got popped.

Damn.
We're gonna win this thing.

Okay...

As your parents
we don't feel

joining the army
is in your best interest.

This country is
in a crisis.

How can one soldier
stop it?

When my enlistment's up,

I could join
the CIA or something.

And with a military
background I'll have a leg up.

And as an arabic speaker,
I'll be really useful.

I don't understand.
You're gonna ask the Donald

for some time off from your
pilot job to go on CIA missions?

- Everything's a joke to you.
- I'm not having a good time.

Did you or did you not want
me to go to military school?

But I started to cry.

At least you'd have
come out an officer.

Even then
I was opposed to it.

I hate this idea.

I'm applying for
officer's candidate school.

I want to be
a liaison officer

with the local
population anyway.

Officer's candidate school?

You have terrible grades.
You flunked out of college.

Here we go. That's all
this is about, right?

No, Anthony, that's not
what this is all about.

You don't want to go to
college... don't go to college,

- but don't get your legs blown off.
- Always with the drama.

So what does your girlfriend
say, the fashion model?

She doesn't think
I should go either.

Well?

Not that long ago you
talked about owning a club.

Right.
You had a problem with that too.

A lot of your friends are
in film school, you say,

especially the ones you
used to go to the clubs with.

Uh...

So I got this screenplay
from Danny Baldwin.

We met at your
cousin's movie.

Danny hoped I'd set him
up with some financing,

- but I never read it.
- Well, you did now.

Yeah, I did now and...

Well, long story short, it's
about a private detective

that gets sucked into the Internet
through his, uh, data port.

And he's gotta solve

some murders and some
virtual prostitutes.

I read it.
It's scary.

Point is, I talked
to little Carmine

And he's interested in
developing it through his company.

He does porn.

He did "Cleaver. "
He's branching out.

You would work
for his producer, Inge.

You would be...
what is the word...

Development executive
on this project.

Really?

What's this gotta do
with clubs?

Hollywood and gossip
columns, the nightspots...

and you get some real-world
experience under your belt,

you come see me
and we will talk

about me investing
in a club.

Run that past Rahoony,
see what she says.

Somebody's giving Grand
Jury testimony on something.

- So Carlo has flipped.
- We don't know.

And subpoenas are flying.

My hunch...

80 to 90% chance
you'll be indicted.

That fucking
gun charge...

I get sick
when I think of it...

Plus interstate fraud and if
Carlo starts talking, homicide...

Give me
the fucking thing.

Not like we haven't
envisioned this day.

No no, it's not.

Look, trials are there
to be won.

... easiest omelet ever.

In 10 seconds you can
open a can of instant soup

Or you can make homemade
soup from scratch,

ready to eat
and serve!

In 10 seconds
you can begin

grating cheese
for a snack

or you can grate cheese,
shred chicken,

chop onions and peppers
to make a zesty filling

that you can
heat and serve

for hot delicious quesadillas
the whole family will love...

All three
ready to heat and serve...

- Oh.
- ... all in 10 seconds or less

with the original
Magic Bullet...

the versatile personal
countertop magician

that does any job
in 10 seconds or less.

Now you can do
small everyday jobs

like chopping
garlic or onions

without the sticky, smelly
mess in just three seconds.

Grate cheese
in just four seconds.

Then screw on
the handy shaker top

and sprinkle
onto pasta or pizza.

Or turn ice, coffee,
milk and chocolate syrup

into a fancy frozen coffee
drink in just se...

Oh my gosh,
I won, I won, I won, I won!

So?

With all due respect, and I mean
that from the bottom of my heart,

- I'm gonna pass.
- I don't fucking believe this.

- Why?
- Every guy who ran that crew died prematurely.

- Aw, come on.
- I beat cancer once.

You've got no idea
what that does to you.

Yeah, I know,
but Jesus...

Richie Aprile, Ralphie M. I.A.; Vito,

And who knows what the
fuck with Carlo, Gigi...

Gigi died
taking a shit.

Doesn't mean it's not
part of an overall pattern.

Paulie, are you gonna deny
yourself life-changing money,

a package to leave your
niece who has M. S.?

It's like your bullshit
with the cat.

The fucking animal
catches mice for us,

- But you'd drown it.
- I would.

He's not looking
at Christopher.

A rat died in the wall
back there or some shit.

I moved the picture.
The fucking thing

came to the new spot
and stared!

It's the abstract shapes
or something.

Tell you this:

Since he's dead,

My gambling luck's
done a 180.

Oh, okay.

It's fine for you
to believe that shit,

but I can't
worry about a jinx?

Ton', I never told this to
another living soul, but...

Yeah?

One time at the Bing,

I was alone to meet
Eddy Lind...

I saw the virgin Mary.

Why didn't you
say something?

Fuck strippers,
we coulda had a shrine,

Sold holy water
in gallon jugs.

Coulda made billions.

I tell you something deep in
my heart and you laugh it off?

I'm not saying there's
nothing out there, Paulie,

But to not live your life?
What the fuck are you gonna do?

You don't want the job...
you don't want the job.

I can put Patsy in there.

He's gonna be
part of my family now.

It'd be good.

Prick.

You always know what
to say to me, don't you?

No, I'm serious.

I live but to serve you,
my liege.

Well, they had to
get it for me.

There's no real
public transport out here.

But I said no more SUV.

Well, that's
the cool part...

23 highway.
It's not so bad.

Hey.

Hey.

Oh, listen, we're not
eating at home tonight.

I thought we'd go
to Holsten's.

You said we have
manigott'.

I got meetings
with carpenters.

Holsten's is
the consensus.

I gotta see some people.
I'll meet you there.

- Carter?
- That's correct.

- And you win $400.

Your spin, Marcia.

- Joker, africa and quotations.
- Sir.

I'll take quotations
for 100, please.

Sir, sir,
excuse me.

... explained
his humor this way:

"all I know is just
what I read... " where?

"In the papers. "

That's right.
You have $200.

- Your spin, ron.
- Okay, thank you, Jack.

Law enforcement,
quotations and a joker.

Let's take
quotations for 100, jack.

The correct answer
will bring you $500...

- Hello.
- What, you don't recognize me?

We used to play catch.

You don't remember
that you shot me?

Enough with
the fucking birds.

I'm Anthony,
Johnny's son.

Fuck you want,
a boutonniere?

All right, listen to me.
Uncle Pat came to see me

about Janice,
about your money.

People keep asking me.
I don't know.

There's a man from another
galaxy that came here.

That's your accountant.

I'm confused!

Any money should go
to Bobby Bacala's kids.

Now Janice may not do that,
but Bobby was with us.

He's a made guy.
Wouldn't be right.

Me, I never had kids.

You remember where your stash
is, you let uncle Pat know.

Me as the head
of the family,

I'll hold on to it as a
guardian, for Bobby's kids.

- You remember Bobby?
- Sure.

You don't know
who I am, do you?

Remember Johnny...
Johnny boy,

Your kid brother?

"This thing of ours. "

I was involved with that?

You and my dad.

You two ran North Jersey.

- We did?
- Yeah.

Hmm.

Well, that's nice.

- Hey.
- Hey.

- What looks good tonight?
- Eh, I don't know.

Where's googootz?

He just called.
He's on his way.

Mead's coming separately.
She had to go to the doctor,

Switch birth control.

Did you talk
to Mink again?

It's Carlo.
He's gonna testify.

Mmm, onion rings.

Best in the state
as far as I'm concerned.

Shit.

How was work today?

All I'm doing is getting coffee
and placing endless phone calls.

You may not realize it
but you are making contacts.

It's an entry-level job.

So buck up.

Right, focus
on the good times.

Don't be sarcastic.

Isn't that what
you said one time...

"try to remember the times
that were good"?

- I did?
- Yeah.

Well, it's true,
I guess.

I went ahead and ordered
some for the table.
