S04E01 - HEXAGRAM 64

Each one of these films show a reality like ours but not.
Some of us are rotten or kind in one reality, rotten or kind in the next.
But most people are different.
          SOLDIERS Heil!
Heil!
ROCKWELL
When the hour of decision came for Thomas Smith, he rose to the occasion in a way that admirably reflected upon his father.
          HELEN The Reichsfuhrer believes in spirits, spectral phenomena.
We could talk to him.
In the beyond?
What have you taken?
I got rid of my pills, if that's what you mean.
          SMITH I know you're a strong woman.
It's my job to protect you.
          HELEN And the school called today.
They want to schedule Jennifer's test.
And if she tests positive?
Stop!
          SMITH Can you just come home?
I love you, John.
Gift baskets
But I was running away from you.
I wish to extend my deepest condolences for the loss of your only son.
I, too, have experienced the same.
You presented a film in Berlin.
I provided that film for Chief Inspector Kido.
You averted war. We deceived them.
How long before the Nazis realize they should have attacked us when they had the chance?
My father allowed his generals to use his throne as a shield for their ambition.
We merely preside over its undoing.
CROWN PRINCESS
My husband, he fears our grip on the empire is loosening.
One thing is certain.
The Nazis covet the Pacific States.
If they perceive weakness, they will strike.
Wyatt Price?
          WYATT I brought you this far.
I think it's time you tell me what the hell's going on.
Ever heard of the Man in the High Castle?
Why are you helping me?
          WYATT They killed half my family in Ireland.
The other half in New York.
And I don't know if that film is real or not, but it got me thinking.
          JULIANA It's proof there are other possibilities.
And this world will not last if we don't change it for the better.
It's only a matter of time. It will get worse.
Help me change it.
          KIDO I have seen those painted all over San Francisco and the Neutral Zone.
I never imagined they were yours.
Where did you see him last?
Denver.
( Grunts ) Where is he?
You remember me, Mr. Frink?
Out of weakness, I let you go.
That was my mistake.
What does it mean, Die Nebenwelt?
It means "the next world." A parallel world. And when we reach it and the world after that...
Heil!
Heil! Heil!
And the world after that, the Reich will be everywhere.
          HIMMLER We will do away with the old.
Today, history ends.
And the future begins!
We must accelerate the number of tests and expand their scale.
Right.
To begin to march troops through!
( Himmler laughs ) There's someone up there. Go!
          JEREMY Grenade! Go!
Go! Move!
Juliana!
No!
No!
Hello, Juliana.
You've been busy since I last saw you.
You know, the night Thomas came to see me, it was heartbreaking how ashamed he was.
Telling him how much you loved him just wasn't enough to save him from the way he was raised.
          SMITH Four people were sent into a portal.
Only one went through.
          ABENDSEN Whatever plans you people have, they won't work.
If she was able to enter a parallel world, it's because she didn't exist in it.

That is what Mr. Tagomi sought.
We lost him to an act of violence... at the very moment... we needed him most.
His spirit is Japan's spirit.
True Japanese spirit.
In our drive for empire building... we have lost sight of this spirit.
Violence produces more violence.
This is what is happening in San Francisco.
Outrageous.
I intend... to see Tagomi's work... completed.

          YAMORI What is your concern, Colonel?
          KIDO My fear is this incursion into Denver is just an opening move by the Reich.
You think John Smith is trying to take advantage of Tagomi's assassination?
I think he might have arranged Tagomi's assassination.
Himmler tried to kill the trade minister twice.
You are overthinking this, Colonel.
The Nazis are clearing out a rat's nest of rebels.
We should take note.
These Nеgrо radicals have mounted, what, 17 attacks in the last three months?

Meantime, the crown princess would like us to coddle them.
General Yamori.
Greetings.
Welcome to my office.
But I am afraid it is dangerous here in San Francisco.

The BCR have stepped up attacks.
Earlier, Your Highness... might well have been their victim.
Were it not for Colonel Kido.
          YAMORI Even Kido can only do so much.
Now, with this Nazi provocation in the Neutral Zone, I must implore Your Highness to return to the safety of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. Perhaps if I were the crown prince, you would be as interested in my views as you are in my safety.
I meant what I said.
I will remain until my work here is complete.
Someone has been whispering in her ear.
Is it you?
Don't be absurd.
Her Highness speaks for herself and with the consent of the palace.
You Navy appeasers are more dangerous than the BCR.
Appeasers?

S04E05 - MAUVAISE FOI

HOST ( OVER RADIO )
Here on 1030 AM, theVoice of the Reich.
Peace has come at last to a war-weary nation as grateful Americans from Broadway to Main Street greet their German liberators.
Recently appointed Reichsmarschall Erwin Rommel took to the streets to greet the adoring American republic.
Citizens everywhere are welcoming the return of local infrastructure: running water in their kitchens and baths, electricity at all hours, and ready stores of food supplies being brought in daily from the Reich's plentiful bounty. Citizen volunteers are invited to join in...
Put on some music, will you?
Anything but that.
          SMITH Leave it on.
We need news. Even their news.

Go on, Helen. Go on.
Here. Warm this up.
          BOLDEN I just came from the handover at West Point.
Patton shook hands with Goering.
It's all settled.
The first men to sign on will get food and good positions in the Reich.
The holdouts will get nothing.
Or death.
We report for duty tomorrow, at 0600.
It's up to you.

W-We can fight them. John.
They say Ike is gathering men.
A militia...
We all saw that bomb.
It was like a thousand suns.
What does it even take to build something like that?
I mean, you know?
What kind of will, and a vision?
It's a crime is what it is.
Well, we'd have built it, too, if we could, but we couldn't.
Could we?
No. It's over.
It's done.
It failed.
When push came to shove, the whole thing just collapsed.
What they have, that's... that works.
What about us, John?
What happens to my family in the Reich?
I don't know.
It isn't much. Okay. Take this, and go.
Go where, John?
Well, just as far as you can.
I remember when we would've died for each other.

We've got black-eyed peas, yams, some cornbread and sweet green tea.
Ooh!

          ELIJAH You really think this admiral's on the level?
He's a military man.
He'll be acting on orders from the royal family.
Probably won't be easy for him to stomach, but... he's taking a risk, too.
Is there any chance the peace will hold?
It's a temporary cease-fire.
I mean, do you think they'll ever agree to our terms?
This is the first time in America or the JPS or the Reich that anyone has ever negotiated with a black man as an equal. That's all we leave with today, it's a victory.
I remember the first time I opened a crate of those Chinese automatic rifles.
I picked one up.
It was so dark and... oiled and heavy.
Man, it felt like... power.
Hmm. Right on, brother.
And from that moment, all I've dreamed of is the day I can put that damn weapon down.

Mmm. Oh.

You made good time.
Got here quick as we could without getting pulled over.
So Santa's sled is in the alley, and it is full of toys.
Much obliged, sir.
Oh, listen, uh...
I got this message when I was on the road.
Someone turned up calling herself Juliana Crain?
Yeah, didn't seem possible, right?
Still doesn't, but I'll-I'll let you see for yourself.
          ZINA ( FAINTLY ) What happened to Himmler and Goring?
And the Nazi leaders?
The Allies, they could've put them up against a wall and shot them.
That's what had always been done when wars ended.
But they decided to do something different.
They gave them a fair trial.
Nazis don't deserve a trial.
Well, they were criminals.
Once they put them on the stand, the world could see them for what they were.
Their crimes were enormous, but these were small, weak men.
They, um, they made excuses.
They claimed they didn't know, that they were helpless to stop it.
Tell them what happened to Hitler.
He hid out in a bunker... and then shot himself in the head.
It seems impossible. ( Chuckles )
Like a dream.
If they can be beaten in that world, they can be beaten in this one.
Sometimes I wondered, you know, if you'd ever made it out of that tunnel.
I was sure you were dead, and I couldn't let it go.
I knew the films were what mattered most to you, to both of us. So...

          EQUIANO My father always wanted me to be a blacksmith.
If you came here expecting to gain anything from your attack the other day, you will be disappointed.
I try not to have any expectations.
That way, I'm never taken by surprise. I bring you only a warning.
If you continue these acts of terror, Japan will bring the full force of its military to bear on the BCR.
We learned about terror at the hands of your Kempeitai.
You're just upset you don't have a monopoly on violence anymore.
I didn't come for a lecture.
You are here to listen to our side. Am I wrong?
I am listening.
You're facing rebellions around the world.
India, China, Australia.
There are millions of us with everything to gain and nothing to lose.
Think how hard you would fight to protect your home islands, Admiral.
This is our home.
You were brought here as slaves.
No one has endured more for this country than our people.
We will endure anything to be free.
What is it you want?
A free state.
Our own territory.
A self-governing republic for black people.
Your letter offered a cease-fire.
Temporary cease-fire.
Depending on what you can offer in return.
I am in no position to offer anything.
Then take a message to the Crown Princess.
We'll need a sign of good faith.
Such as?
Stop the Kempeitai round-ups in the ghetto.
( Inokuchi sighs ) I will see... what can be done.
          INOKUCHI Tell me... why didn't you become a blacksmith?
I found out I was afraid of horses.
To this day, I still get sick the first two days at sea.

He's a man of war who's trying to learn to make peace.

What about Admiral Inokuchi? He is in custody. We will make arrangements to send him to Tokyo to face a naval court-martial.
I will accompany him.
No. He will be court-martialed here in San Francisco.
The Royal Family may not approve.
This is a military matter.
The Crown Princess does not need to be involved.
She should be kept insulated, for her own sake.
Tokyo will be pleased.
With Hampton dead, Tagomi's killers have been brought to justice.
I am still investigating the Tagomi murder.
          YAMORI I thought I told you to close the file.
I gave the Crown Princess my word. Let's not delude ourselves.
In your 15 years as chief inspector, you have planted evidence, elicited false confessions, executed suspects without trial. You have done all this... why?
Out of loyalty to the cause of a Japanese San Francisco.
          SAITO And you gave your son to that cause as well.
Captain Iijima's told me about Toru's recent... incident at the Bamboo Palace.
You chose your path 15 years ago, Kido.
It's too late to change now.
          YAMORI I look forward to hearing your testimony at Inokuchi's court-martial.

The Japanese authority has confirmed that Equiano Hampton, the leader of the Nеgrо terrorist group known as the Black Communist Rebellion, was killed last night...
( Whispers ): Oh, damn it.
In a daring raid by Kempeitai forces. Governor General Yamori praised the work of Kempeitai officers in dispensing swift retribution.
Did we kill him...
Elijah?
Late last night in Moraga, was conducted with zero Kempeitai casualties...
Were we so...

( Clears throat ) Well, we got a... number of operations on the board in the planning stages.
You're talking about the portal. Yeah, we've got it under observation. But, uh, they've fortified it heavily in the past year, so us moving on it now would require a major assault.
( Quietly ): Yeah, I think so.
What about John Smith?
BELLOWS
His apartment building is a fortress, so we're gonna need to, uh, catch him in transit in order to make an attempt on him. Of course, that's gonna mean intelligence on his movements.
Where were these photos of Helen taken?
She was living in the Neutral Zone for the past year with her daughters.
We were gonna make an approach on her.
And what stopped you?
We were waiting for your shipment when Helen went back to New York.
Wait a minute, what was she doing in the Neutral Zone to begin with?
I don't know.
Hardly matters now.
Well, it absolutely matters.
Look, Helen Smith is a woman who's... lost a child.
No one lives through that experience unchanged.
And very few marriages, if any, survive that unchanged, either.
So if she left for the Neutral Zone, she had to have been desperate.
And if there's a crack in that marriage... that's a way in.
          BELLOWS That's all soap opera now.
None of that matters now. We lost her.
She went back to her husband.
Maybe she went back by choice.
Maybe she went back because she had no choice.
( Elevator bell dings )
( Chuckles ): I'm sorry. I think there's been a mistake.
How did you get access to this floor?
There's no mistake, Helen.
My name is Martha.
I'll be your wife-companion.
Excuse me?
It is my duty to discreetly accompany you on all of your public outings.
For your personal security. Who sent you here? We're a service of the Staatspolizei, formed to... meet the unique needs of the First Families of the Party. But we can be much more than that. Hmm. The Reichsmarschall called you here to keep an eye on me while he's out of town on business, is that it?
Or is this more than that?
Many Reich wives come to view their... wife-companion as a confidant.
There are so few people a Reichsmarschall's wife can talk to, after all.
Tell the Staatspolizei that I don't need a companion.
I understand completely.
I can follow at a distance.

          DIRECTOR Okay, quiet, everyone.
Cameras rolling.
We go live in five... four...
          NEWSREADER Ladies and gentlemen, the Reichsfuhrer of North America.
My fellow Americans.
The last few days have been difficult for us all.
Heinrich Himmler was a father to our people.
We mourn his loss.
But with his passing comes an opportunity for rebirth and renewal.
A change has come to the Western states, and with it, a chance to take our divided land and bring it back together. A great transformation is coming.
Soon, we will be one nation again.
          DIRECTOR And clear.
( Applause ) Let's wrap it up, everyone.
Thanks, Ted.
Great speech.
Thanks, Bill.
How'd I do?
You were wonderful, Daddy.
Good.
Reichsfuhrer, our meeting with high command is about to begin, so...
John, I need a moment in private.
Give us a moment.
Of course.
Stay with Bridget, girls.
          JENNIFER Yes, Mother. Sorry, Helen, I haven't had the chance to get back to the apartment since the plane touched down.
So what is it?
Two SS came by the apartment this morning.
They tore out a rat's nest of wires and microphones from our walls, our phones...
They were acting on my orders, Helen.
Are you sure they got everything?
Hoover is no longer a problem.
Oh...
But I'm not just thinking about Hoover.
No.
You don't need to worry.
Our family is no longer in danger from Berlin. You know, a long time ago, we told ourselves that if we ever had the chance, we might do things differently.
( Knocking on door ) A moment, please.
John, there are things that we need to discuss privately.
Yes, I know, but we can't discuss them here.
Then when?
The day after tomorrow, I'm gonna be taking a train to the Poconos, 11:00 a.m.
I'd like you to join me.
Everything's gonna be made clear, I promise.
All right.
Come in.
Gentlemen, take your seats.
Sir, this has just arrived from Berlin.
Sir, it's plans for Phase Five.
          AMY Mom? Are you coming?
          BELLOWS I am giving him cephalosporin to fight infection.
His wounds are healing, but the stitches won't be ready to come out for another week or so.
Gestapo really scoured that clinic looking for the bodyguard, and we got the nurse to safety, but...
Well, it's only a matter of time before they come rolling through Harlem going house to house.
We're gonna gamble that we're safe for another 24 hours.
You should go, though. Get to the Poconos.
What about Helen?
You know, I...
I'm not sure anything I said had an effect on her, honestly.
She was terrified.
We've come this far. We have to finish it.
          BELLOWS Well, you took your chance, and it, uh, it was worth a chance. Thank you.
Well, it's not over. We've got 400 people ready to make an assault on the portal.
Something's coming, you know.
I don't know what it is, but I've been sensing it.
          BELLOWS Well, that's all the more reason to blow it to kingdom come, right? ( Chuckles ) It's an abomination.
It's only an abomination 'cause the Nazis control it.
But what if we controlled it?
That's a doorway to a universe where the Allies won the war.
I don't know that anyone can control it for long.
          BELLOWS I guess we'll see you in the Poconos?
          WYATT We'll be waiting.
Take good care of our boy here.
Be careful. He, uh, he cheats at cards.
Sometimes you got to even the odds, you know what I mean?
Uh-huh.

I'm a businessman, much like yourself.
You're nothing like myself.
Okay.
I'm a businessman.
I have a shop filled with valuable Americana.
There's nothing else like it, anywhere.
Do we know this store?
I understand you have a trawler that's going to Japan.
These are the keys to my shop.

I want my son.
Bring me Colonel Kido's son.
          OKAMI He owes.
I can pay his debts.
The yen is no good here anymore.
We must return to the old ways.
I am familiar with the old ways. I know you are, Taisa.
I have no doubt you would gun us all down, but if you did, you wouldn't last long, and neither would your boy. So we must barter for his life.
What do you want?
I want you to serve me as my saiko-komon, my supreme adviser.
Don't do this.
These are my debts.
( Okami speaking Japanese )
Are you prepared to become a member of the Ninkyo Dantai?
I am.
For the boat.
You should go now.
