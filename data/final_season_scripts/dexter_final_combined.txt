Previously on
Dexter: New Blood...

I can't believe
Molly Park is in Iron Lake.

She's a podcaster?

It's only, like,
the most popular

true crime podcast
out there.

You're into true crime?

I'll text you my top five.

Yeah, man, look at this shit.

Who's Ethan?

That ball sack over there.

I've always fantasized




about hurting Zach like that.

Leave Ethan alone.

But you actually did it.

Reservation
Land Management

has footage of Matt Caldwell
shooting that deer.

Somebody committed an attack,
then tried to cover it up.

We're looking at foul play.

Search dogs?

You have to move Matt's body.

Those dogs are gonna
walk a straight line

from the crime scene
to your firepit.

- Did you hear my news?
- No. What's the news?

He's alive.

Matty's alive.




That's unbelievable.

What's your theory?

He couldn't face that
his son was dead,

so he had some
sort of delusion.

I don't think so.
He's lying.

- Why?
- He doesn't trust the cops.

Wants to take matters
into his own hands.

That's what you would do.

Kurt's nothing like me.

Do you remember how
enraged he was

when he saw the video
of the other person

out there in the woods?

Yeah, he thought
it was a Seneca.

He thinks that Johnny Bullhorn
murdered Matt

for shooting the deer,

and Angela is protecting him.

So he gets Angela
to close down the case,

waits for things to cool off...

and bam, he kills Johnny.

Kurt goes to jail.

All because of... you.

- It could be worse.
- Worse?

Once the small-town cops
are out of the way,

Kurt does due diligence
onto Johnny,

and he realizes
he couldn't have done it.

So he keeps digging

all the way...

...to his son's real killer.

Hey there.

Did you hear the news?

About Matt?

Can you believe it?

I was right in the first place.
He just skipped town.

Yeah.

Well, who'd you hear it from?

Uh... Kurt.

You talked to Kurt?

Yeah, it was late,
so I had to get groceries

for Harrison at that 24-hour
market in Moose Creek.

And on my way home, I saw Kurt
coming out of The Tavern.

He looked like he'd had
one too many,

so I gave him a ride home.
He was celebrating.

Hey, Chief!

You were right all along.

Um, I got to go.

I'll talk to you later.
I love you.

Okay. Love you, too.

Morning, buddy.

- You want some breakfast?
- I got it.

Made the team.

Coach Logan says
I have to gain five pounds

before the first match.

That's great.
You're making friends.

Eh. Most of the guys
on the team are fuck-nuggets.

What?

Your Aunt Deb used to
say that.

Fuck-nuggets.

Oh, yeah.

I wasn't sure what you
remembered. Like, if anything.

I don't, much.
Except for the swears.

But, yeah, she was fun.

Yes. She was.

You want some of this?

I'd rather put out
a campfire with my face.

That was always one of
my favorites.

You miss her?

Oh, she's in my thoughts
all the time.

Got to go.

- Later, Dad.
- See you.

Hey.

Ah. Matt always did
keep us on our toes.

Yeah, he really outdid
himself this time, huh?

- Hey, Mr. Caldwell.
- Hey.

Oh. What a relief.

- Mm.
- You can say that again.

You know, I knew Matty
would be all right,

he always is,
but I got to tell you,

he had me worried this time.

Yeah. Me, too. Me, too.

Oh, hey. Okay.

And what time was this?

Around ten.

And you said it was FaceTime,

so did you see where he was?

Looked like a hotel room.

He said he was in New York City.

Did he look injured at all?

Injured?

We found his blood in the woods.

Right. Right. Um...

I didn't see any injury. No.

Did he tell you what happened,

or who the other person was
out there? Anything?

You know, I-I didn't
think to ask.

I mean, I was just very relieved

that my son was alive,
you know?

What he put you through,

what... the whole... what
he put the whole town through,

it's definitely not okay.

No, it's not.
He owes me a call.

Sure.

I've tried his cell
a number of times.

It just goes
straight to voice mail.

So if-if you could help me
get ahold of him...

Look, Chief, if this is about
him killing that white deer

on tribal land,
I will pay the fine.

You know I'm always good for it.

I'm always cleaning up
his messes.

It's not my jurisdiction.

I just need help closing
the missing person's case

and clearing up who assaulted
whom in the woods.

Okay, look, I didn't want
to have to get into this,

but, uh, when I saw him
on FaceTime,

he looked like he was
high on something,

like he hadn't slept in days.

And he does this sometimes.
He goes on benders.

And I won't hear from him
for weeks, or even months.

Well, you heard from him
last night.

Yeah, 'cause he wanted money,
which I wouldn't give him.

I'll try, but-but I'm not
gonna promise anything.

He didn't answer the ten
phone calls I made before that,

or the two after.

Man, he acts like a teenager,

but he's a,
he's a 30-year-old man,

and at some point you got
to let 'em go, right?

No, no.

She's just
out of this meeting now.

Right. We can talk
about it. Yeah, yeah.

But we should probably
schedule it

- at another...
- Hi.

Oh, oh, look, I-I'm sorry,
I told her it was

inappropriate for her
to visit me here, so...

Visit you?

Well, you know, we-we...
we've met once before.

We-we had a couple of drinks,
and we slept together,

and he was amazing.
Wow, that's some, like, real

- Carrie from Homeland shit.
- Uh...

Does it have anything
to do with the case?

I know you're a reporter.

I'm not a reporter.

I'm a podcaster.
Print is dead.

I have a real aversion to liars.

Oh, no, I wasn't lying.

I said I was here to help with
the search, and I was.

And you're doing a story
about it.

A rich, white,
entitled cisgender guy

illegally shoots
a rare white buck

on reservation land,
and then up and disappears?

Of course I am. Was that his dad
you were talking to?

- Well, the story's over, so...
- Have you talked to Matt?

It's weird, right?

I mean, the guy evades
law enforcement

and a town full of
concerned citizens.

Finally pops his head up,

and he can't even bother
to answer his cell phone?

- I've been trying him also.
- Okay. You need to leave now.

Do you think that he
attacked someone in the woods?

Or do you think his dad
is covering for him,

for some odd, strange...

If you don't leave,
I'm going to arrest you

for interfering
with an investigation.

Right. We don't want that.

Call me when you're off. Mm.

Mm-hmm.

Okay. I-I...
I just thought that...

Run Matt's credit cards.

I did that a few days ago.
There's no hits.

But you don't buy
what Molly said about...

I don't give a shit
what Molly said.

But I do care
about what Kurt said.

Matt is staying at a hotel
in New York.

Run his cards.

Poor bastard.

I get that he's upset,

but why did he lie
about his son being alive?

Hi-hi, and welcome
to Merry Fucking Kill.

I'm Molly Park, and do I have
a doozy of an episode for you.

Today, I'm doing
the creepy-as-fuck

and truly terrifying
Trinity Killer.

Spoiler alert,
he didn't kill in threes.

He killed in fucking fours.

Let's talk about kill cycle
number one: Lady in the Water.

Trinity would find a young
woman, break into her house,

and then slaughter her
with a straight razor.

He left them soaking
in a pool of their own plasma.

The police are finally hip
to his M.O., but, of course,

they don't get it together
fast enough to stop him

from one final cut.

For this one, he goes rogue.

Still a woman,
but this chick is a mother.

A gorgeous,
girl-next-door beauty

with a picture-perfect family.

And this is the real
fucked-up part.

She has a young baby,

who is in the fucking room
when she dies,

crawling in a pool
of his mother's blood.

How fucked-up is that kid now?
Am I right?

He's usually very friendly.

Maybe he can smell my goats.

I think he's just aggressive
because he hates his name.

I don't know.
I'm new at this.

Maybe I got to go empty the dog.
Okay. I'll be back.

Come on, Garfield.

Jim, did you get the alert?

Yeah, what's going on?

I'm getting to the scene now.

All I know is,
there are multiple injuries,

and Harrison is involved.

Stay back, please.

- Jim. Jim!
- Where's my son?

They're working on him
inside. This way.

Harrison, are you okay?

Yeah, I'm okay, Dad.

Fortunately the stab
wound isn't very deep.

Who stabbed you?

It's-it's... it's not,
it's not that bad.

Harrison, when Tess
found you and Ethan,

she said that you told her
something about

a planned school shooting.

Uh, yeah, that's-that's how
this all started.

Uh, Ethan asked me
to meet him backstage.

And-and then, um,
when we were alone, he,

he told me he wanted to get
revenge on all these kids

that have been bullying him.

He was just gonna
bring guns to school

- and open fire.
- Why did he tell you that?

He, um...

Because he wanted me
to do it with him.

And what happened next?

I told him,
I mean, I-I get it.

I mean, feeling angry
and-and feeling bullied.

But I said, "There's
got to be some other way

we can handle it." I tried
to get him to come with me

to talk to a teacher,
or get him some help, you know?

But, um, that's when he pulled
a knife out of his backpack.

He just came right at me
and stabbed me.

Logan,
check the backpack.

On it.

And then what happened?

Well, it, it all
happened so fast.

I mean, I-I just,
I was really scared,

and I just, like, tackled him

and the knife came out
of his hands, and-and

I-I got to it first,
then I-I was,

I was waving it in front of me,
telling him to stop,

but he just kept charging at me,
like he was crazy, you know?

And...
And that's, um,

that's when I got his leg.

I-I think I... I think I cut him
really bad.

He was... he was bleeding so
much, I could... I could see it

soaking through his jeans,
and, um...

then he passed out.

Is-is he... is he gonna die?

I... I-I didn't mean to hurt him
like that, I swear.

I-I didn't mean
to hurt him like that, Dad.

Angela?

I think you need
to take a look at this.

Oh, Jesus.

It's a kill list.

Um...

Did Ethan talk to anyone else
about this?

Is there anyone else who could
have been in on it with him?

No.

I'm his only friend.

Okay.

Logan, you and I are going
to Ethan's house immediately.

We need to check on his parents.

There may be weapons
or explosives there.

Come in.

- Did you take your antibiotic?
- Yeah.

How's it feeling?

I'm pretty freaked out.

Oh.

I just keep...
I keep replaying it.

Ethan coming at me
with that knife.

You ever have a situation scare
the shit out of you like that?

Yeah.

What do you do to deal?

I wrap bad guys

in plastic and kill them.

I, um, guess I...

I'm not sure.

Right. No, for sure.

I mean, you can still talk about
it more with me if you want.

No, I'm okay.

Really. I'm fine.

- Okay.
- I'm fine.

- Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

Aw.

Who's the world's greatest dad?

That's funny.
That's good, Deb.

Man, to think,
from the moment he was born,

you were worried that he would
inherit your fucked-up genes.

But...

he's emotional,
he's empathetic, personable,

popular, heroic even.

And you're so different.

It's gonna be impossible

for you to have a relationship
with your own son.

I can stay home
with you today, if you want.

I know school's shut down.

No, it's cool. Ow.

I can just...
I can hang here by myself.

What are you looking at?

When Ethan came at you,
you were...

facing him, right?

He suddenly charged at you?

- What are you...?
- That's what you told Angela.

Yeah.

Did he knock you down first?

- I-I don't remember.
- Do you remember

if he was holding the knife
in his left or right hand?

No, I-I don't remember which
fucking hand. I was attacked.

It's not every day that type

- of shit happens to me.
- I know. I...

Well, then
why are you interrogating me?

Sorry.

It's just my old forensic brain.

I know
you've been through a lot.

Just stabbed
by my friend, is all.

Where are you going?

Outside to breathe some fresh,
cold air.

Is that all right, or do you
have questions about that, too?

What are you doing?

The stab wound doesn't match
the story he told Angela.

Something's off.

You're off.

He's normal.

Details get mixed up.

Normal people, you know,
fuckers who aren't mental cases,

they get rattled
when crazy shit happens.

I hope you're right.

Do you?

Nah, he wasn't there
when we arrived on scene.

Yeah, I don't know
what happened there, but, uh...

Nah, I don't know.

Yeah, you know, they said
that we need to go back, so...

Excuse me?

Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Williams.
Um...

I-I just came
to see how Ethan was doing.

He's still very sedated.

He lost so much blood,
he could have died

if the paramedics hadn't gotten
there as quickly as they did.

I'm sorry.

I... I-I didn't mean to, um...

E-Ethan's, like,
my only friend here.

He liked you, too.

How-how are you doing?

Oh, I'm... I'm okay.

Um... maybe, uh,
maybe when Ethan's better

- and comes home...
- He isn't coming home.

Well, I thought
that the-the surgery...

What do you think
is going on here?

Iron Lake isn't
our home anymore.

We've been getting
death threats.

No one's ever gonna buy anything
from my store again.

We have to sell our house
and leave.

And Ethan's probably going
to juvie.

- Why didn't you come to us?
- Beth, it's not his fault.

If you had just told me,
I could have helped.

God, it didn't need
to happen this way.

You should have come to us!

Listen,

she's obviously very upset.

We both are.

You should know
we appreciate what you did.

It could've been a lot worse.

But we don't ever want
to see you again.

You understand?

Hey, Jim.

How's Harrison?

Uh, he's okay,
all things considered.

I heard the stab wound
wasn't too deep.

Yeah, you know
about as much as I do, then.

Going
to the police station to see

if your son is lying
about a stabbing he was in.

What page of
the parenting handbook is that?

Are you sure
you want to look at that?

I'm curious.

Jim, I'm a cop,

and I'm messed up knowing
that Audrey was meant

to be a victim of Ethan's.

But your son actually
was attacked.

I was meant to be a victim?

Audz, I told you,
you cannot be in here.

- Don't change the subject.
- Audrey.

I deserve to know if I was.

- Holy shit.
- Audz, out. Out.

- Now!
- What about Jim?

- Why is he in here?
- He should go, too.

I actually have some information
that might be helpful.

You do?

Yeah, the weapons you found
stashed in Ethan's room,

they're from Fred's.

I sold them to Ethan's father
a couple of months ago.

Along with that knife.

What is your problem?

The angle of the penetration
of his wound,

the blood spatter.

Nothing matches his story.

His story?

He was stabbed,
non-fictitiously.

It doesn't add up.

Everything he said about Ethan
turned out to be true.

The kill list, the weapons.
It all adds up.

Prove it.

What?

You're Ethan. I'm Harrison.
Show me what happened.

- Do it.
- You are fucking crazy.

- Harrison's lying.
- You can't handle the fact

that Harrison is a hero.

That was always your wet dream.

Yay!

And you can't stand the fact
that he's living it,

because you are a jealous,

fucking pussy.

Blood doesn't lie.

The spatter doesn't match.

How do we recreate
these patterns?

I don't know.

This time we see if Harrison
attacked Ethan first.

What are you trying to do here?

- Make sense of this.
- No, you're not.

You're trying to make him
into a monster, like you.

'Cause that's the only way you
can feel like a real dad, right?

Is if he looks up to you
and wants to be like you

so you could have some sick-ass
serial killer family.

He's a good kid.
He's nothing like you.

I am so sick of your bullshit.

It matches.

Stop it!

This is all in your head!
You are creating this!

Ethan was the one trying
to get away.

No.

Harrison attacked him
from behind.

Then he stabbed himself
to sell us on this story.

He planned the whole thing.

Tell me
that's not what happened.

Why would Harrison slash
Ethan first?

He didn't hate him.

He wanted to know
what it felt like.

It's almost like
he fit the Code.

Smells good.

He even eats like me.

What?

How you feeling?

Lot less pain, actually.

I know school's back on,
but they'd understand

if you stayed home another day.

I want to get back
into a routine.

I totally get that.

I totally get that.

So did you notice anything
going on with Ethan

before that day?

I didn't know anything until
Ethan got me alone at school.

- Kurt, what's going on?
- Hey, Jim.

Well, I just thought
I'd bring Iron Lake's own hero

a little show of appreciation.

- Oh.
- How's he doing?

He's a little rattled,
as you can imagine,

but I can take it in to him.

Was kind of hoping
to shake his hand,

thank him personally, you know?

- Okay.
- Yeah?

Sure.

Hey!

There he is. Hey, stud.

I, uh,
got you a little something

for keeping our town safe.

Thanks.

- Just, yeah, go ahead, open it.
- Oh.

It's for you.

- Oh.
- Huh?

Holy shit. A...

A drone.

This is really cool.

Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.

Oh, just call me Kurt.

Okay.

Well, I, um,
I should... I should go.

Thanks again, Kurt.

Yeah. No, well, thank you.
Thank you, son.

Ah, boy, must be nice.

Hmm?

Having a hero for a son.

Ah.

Yeah, my Matt,
he's... he's the opposite.

Well, he seems like a fun person
to be around.

Ah, no, he's a fuckup.

Wish I'd done something about it

when he first started
fucking up.

Kept thinking
he'd grow out of it.

But there was a darkness in him,

- and you knew it.
- Yeah, but I just kept

helping him get out of trouble.

But it's not really
Matt's fault, you know?

It's my fault.

I wouldn't say that.

Well... the truth is,

I just raised a terrible kid.

I mean, my Matt's much more
like Ethan than he is Harrison.

- No.
- No, he's worse.

I-I mean, Ethan might have
wanted to kill people,

but Matt actually did.

Hey, he didn't mean
to crash that boat.

He didn't crash it.

He wasn't driving.

No, I know. I meant it
the same way you did.

How do you even know
about that?

My girlfriend's
the chief of police.

And not
to throw anyone under the bus,

but Esther's a bit of a gossip.

Mm-hmm.

So what did Esther
and your girlfriend say

about the boat accident?

That Matt wasn't driving,

and that teenagers do
stupid things.

He wasn't a teenager.

Oh, I didn't know that.

I knew that.

Look, Kurt, you can't
carry around this guilt.

Kids are born the way they are.

I wasn't in Harrison's life
for the last ten years.

Look how he turned out.

Yeah, you're right.

I appreciate that.

But you'll see.

You know, if Harrison
ever does anything wrong,

it is hard not
to feel responsible for it.

Fuck.

The guy's fishing,
and I just nibbled.

- Hey.
- So,

I just wanted
to formally let you know

that we're not bringing
any charges

against Harrison
for stabbing Ethan.

It's been ruled
an act of self-defense,

no matter what Ethan tried
to claim.

What did he say?

He swears
he never stabbed Harrison.

Well, how does he explain...?

He said that Harrison
just suddenly slashed him.

And that's the last thing
he remembers.

You know, I try to have
some compassion for him.

He's clearly a troubled kid.

Yeah.

So, we're moving forward
with our case against Ethan.

And I don't know if you want me

to put you in touch
with a lawyer,

if you want to look
into a civil case, or...

No, he and his family
are going through enough.

Wow.
If I were in your position,

I don't know if I could be
so compassionate.

You're a good person, Jim.

Take it.

I'll call you later?

Okay. I love you.

Love you, too.

Chief Bishop.

Ethan's telling the truth.

This wound wasn't made
by a hunting knife.

Harrison brought his own weapon
to school that day.

Hey.
I heard your son was amazing.

Gonna call you back.

Just wait a minute.

I come with a peace offering.

I'm not drinking, Molly.

Well, there's no point
in sticking around.

I've alienated the one person

that I needed
to tell this story.

Can I get that in writing?

Consider this...
my goodbye present.

Faith Darwas.
Three days ago,

outside
of a Dollar Store in Tulsa.

I googled a few of your, uh,
names on this Carrie board here.

Which, by the way, is not a jab.

I mean,
that it's crazy thorough,

which is how
people describe my work.

How did you get this?

I posted their pics on my
Merry Fucking Kill Insta-feed.

You'd be surprised
what 800,000 amateur sleuths

can dig up
in a matter of hours.

I also got
her last three addresses

and a cell phone number.

- You talked to her?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

She goes by Lauren now.

She left because her mom was
a pill-popper

with a rotating door
of shitty boyfriends.

She's doing a lot better now.

So she was just another runaway.

Just like everybody said.

She is alive.
That's a good thing.

Well, yeah, of course.
It's just...

Um...

Maybe I am fucking crazy.

Look, I pretty much
traffic in crazy,

and you are
most definitely not.

I posted these ones, as well.

Nothing. Not one sighting.

Not even a psychic claiming to
feel their aura in New Mexico,

and I usually get
at least three of those.

So whoever these women are,

they are most definitely
missing.

And no one is looking
for them, except for you.

Let me in on your theory.

'Cause I know you got one.

When I was in high school,
my best friend disappeared.

Iris.

Everyone said she ran away.

No one looked for her.

It stuck with you.

So, when I became a cop,
I promised myself

that I'd be different.

I got a reputation as being
the cop who would listen.

I started collecting
these women's stories.

Poor, from troubled homes.

Some of them Native.

Everyone assumes
they just moved on.

But I know in my gut something
terrible is happening to them.

I know
you don't want to hear this,

but I think
we should form an alliance.

I mean,
what if I followed the story

while you investigate,
from a close proximity?

I mean, you said it yourself.
You need resources.

And I've got an army
of armchair detectives.

I-I thought you wanted
to do the Matt Caldwell story.

Well, you know, every great
podcast starts about one thing

and then ends up somewhere
completely unexpected.

If you want to help me
shed light on these women,

I'll take it.

Great.

Okay.

I know
this is gonna take a while,

but I need you to run me
through everything you have.

Okay. Now I'm ready.

Uh, yeah, come in.

Mr. Caldwell,
sorry to bother you,

but a few customers
have mentioned

- the girl camped out in our...
- Uh, I'll take care of it.

- Really? I don't mind.
- I got it.

Thanks, Susan.

Hi, Kurt. Just checking

to see
if you've heard from Matt.

I have a couple of questions
that I need to ask, so...

Okay.

Hey, uh, Chloe, right?

Yeah. Look, I-I know I said
I was gonna use that money

you gave me
to get bus fare to my mom's,

but I, I was really hungry

and-and I needed
to buy a new coat,

'cause it's cold
as hell out there,

- and I just...
- It's okay. It's okay.

If you spot me another 80,

I will get that bus fare.

I swear, just-just give me
your address, and I'll...

and I'll send it back to you
as soon as I get to my mom's.

I can't keep
giving you money, sweetheart.

You know what I can give you?

A job.

Waitress at the diner.

Make your own money.
What do you say?

The thing is, I'm...
I'm not staying.

I just need bus fare.

Can you just

help me with that?

Coach Logan, or should I say
Sergeant Logan,

who is here with us today
in his official capacity

to talk to you because you were
on Ethan's list. Listen up.

Hey, everyone.

What's up, Coach?

Okay, okay, settle down.

Um... first of all,

I want to say how proud I am of
how you all handled yourselves

during a situation
I obviously wish

you'd never had to experience.

You acted with... maturity

and courage.

Uh, but please be understanding
of yourselves,

or-or any of your friends

who are going through
a tough time in the aftermath.

Counseling is being offered
to each of you.

It's a scary thing

to be targeted like that.

It's good to talk about it,
how you feel.

Uh, I'd like
to open this up to anyone

who'd like
to share their concerns or...

or ask me any questions.

Zach.

Uh, yeah, I just want
to give a shout-out to Harrison

for saving all our asses.

Um, yeah, I-I think
I speak for all of us

when I say how grateful we are

that you're a part
of our community.

- Speech!
- Speech!

Speech! Speech! Speech!

Speech! Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!

All right, but if he
doesn't want to talk, it's okay.

I mean, I don't really
know what to say.

Um, I'm glad no one got hurt.

Except Ethan.

You-you know, personally,

I don't really hold anything
against Ethan.

I mean, yeah, he, uh, he planned
to do something terrible.

And he ended up stabbing me,

but, uh,

you guys picked on him
for years.

You-you beat him up,
made fun of him.

You kind of made his life hell,
you know?

And I guess it's like, yeah,

yeah, we're all victims,
or whatever.

And I know everyone's saying
that Ethan was a-a-a psycho

or a-a monster or something,

but he was definitely
also a victim.

So...

I don't know.

I guess
we all have two sides to us.

Maybe we're a little bit hero
and a little bit,

I-I don't know, monster.

It's all about
which side wins out in the end.

Trinity used a straight razor

to kill his mother.

He was born in blood,
just like you.

He has my Dark Passenger.

Who the hell is this guy?

Afternoon, Mr. Caldwell.

Hey, Elric,
could you turn the fucking

hillbilly music down a little?

Yeah. Sor-Sorry.

The old ru...

Everything okay?

Yeah, everything's fine.

Just checking in.
How's your job coming?

Oh, I got
your fish-and-game guy.

Oh, easy as pie.
You handling his son?

My son?

I'm handling everything.

I'll see you soon.

Fuck.

Ah.

Fuck!

It almost fell, oh, my God.

Hello?

Hey, Harrison, I'm headed to
the Truck Stop. Are you there?

I thought you were in jail.

Oh, no, no, no.

That... We got that cleared up.

That was just
a misunderstanding.

Cool. Cool.

Y-Yeah, actually, I, um...

I-I'm not at the Truck Stop

right now. I had to leave
a little early, uh,

'cause my dad came by,
we had a huge fight.

What do you mean, a huge fight?
You okay?

Yeah, I'm okay.

Yeah, well,
it doesn't sound like it.

Your dad just doesn't let up,
does he?

Is he with you now?

N-No, I, um...
I don't know where he is.

Mm.

Uh, well, did he call you
to check to see if you're okay?

No.

Okay. Well, I'm sure he's just,
uh, tied up with something.

Hey, listen, buddy,
uh, where are you?

Um, I'm a-across the street
from the-the Christmas tree lot.

Okay, you stay right there,
all right?

I'm gonna come and pick you up.

I got a surprise for you.

I got to lose this guy,

get back to his truck
and find my son.

Hey. What's up?

It's Christmas Eve is what's up.

Go home.

Yeah. I'm...
I'm headed out soon.

- You good?
- I will be.

Well, you know,
if you ever, uh,

want to grab a drink
or anything...

I'm sure that Jim would love
to hear from you.

Did you hear that we-we had
drinks the other night?

- I didn't.
- You know, he acts

all easy breezy,
but underneath, he's...

He cares a lot

about you and Harrison.
I mean, look at how

upset he got
after his kid almost OD'd.

Nearly killed that drug dealer.

What are you talking about?

Uh, that's right.
You were, um...

You were in New York.
Well, we went to Crystal Bar

to arrest the drug dealer,
Miles O'Flynn.

Jim had already found the guy

and was, uh,
beating the shit out of him.

- How did you not tell me this?
- Oh, I meant to. I just...

Okay, look,
I didn't want it to look like

I was talking shit
about your boyfriend.

Uh, his anger got
the best of him.

If-if it was my kid, I probably
would have reacted the same way.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I-I-I wasn't trying to,
you know,

make you upset or anything. I...

Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

It's... it's been a tough week.

I really hate it
when I'm the one who's bleeding.

Your son's blood.

It's all on your hands.

Goddamn save him.

I'm working on it.

That's it. I guarantee
it'll make you feel dyno-mite.

- Shit. No, I wasn't doing shit!
- Hey! Hey, hey!

You've got some time to talk.

Fucking bullshit! I was just

- drinking a beer, man.
- Relax, Miles.

I'm not gonna hurt you
or bust you.

I'm here to ask you about your
encounter with Jim Lindsay.

Who?

He was the guy
who did that to your face.

Oh. That guy. Fucking lunatic.

Yeah. I'm still thinking
about pressing charges.

Do you want
to tell me what went down?

This isn't like a trick
or something, right?

Like, you're not trying
to entrap me?

Okay?
'Cause I'm not fucking stupid.

No? Well, you help me out,
I'll return the favor.

Okay. All right.

So, I was at the bar,
having a drink,

when that, uh, Jim dude,
or whatever his name is,

comes over to me,
all friendly and shit.

- Friendly?
- Yeah. He asks me

if I could... do him a favor.

Heard you might know
where to get some blues.

Follow me outside.

He asked you for drugs?

Your words, not mine.

Anyway, so he gets me outside
over by the dumpsters.

So I could...

So you could do him that favor?

Right. Except out of nowhere,
he fucking jumped me.

He just started attacking you
with no provocation?

Yeah, just started
swinging at me.

And look, okay,
this is gonna sound crazy,

but before he started
pounding on me,

he poked me in the neck, with,
like, a needle or some shit.

- A needle?
- Yeah, and so, I was like,

"What the fuck?" And I look up,
and I see the police rolling up,

and I'm like,
what the actual fuck?

And that's when he started
throwing fists, man.

- Wait. Wait.
- He's got fast hands, yo.

He starts punching you
after the cops show up?

Yeah, man. Yeah, just right
as they rolled up.

And the thing he poked you with,
you're sure it was a needle?

Well, I-I didn't really
get a good look at it, okay?

It all happened so fast,
but, like, I mean, look.

I still got the fucking mark.
Check it.

Kurt said I had
to bring you in alive.

You know what?

He'll just have to understand.

Right?

I mean, you know, shit.

I think the school's closed for,
you know, Christmas break.

Yeah, well, they haven't
changed the locks

since I was Matt's wrestling
coach, so...

What about security cameras?

Oh, you mean
for our precious children?

No, those are reserved
for tracking white deer

because
that's what's important, right?

Sometimes
it feels good to be bad.

Don't you think?

Yeah.

Besides, what are they gonna
do... arrest me? Again?

Fucking snow.

Even a three-year-old
could track me.

Come on, big man,
head on down that creek

so I can get back to my son.

First perfect game

- in school history.
- That's Matt?

Yeah. He was about your age.

Ah, I used to go
to every one of his games.

That's what I loved most
about being a dad.

Whoa. He lettered
in three sports?

Yeah. He was...

he was special.

Well, how's he doing?
Have you talked to him lately?

Actually...
I haven't, you know.

Uh, we never really
communicated very well.

Not like you and me.

Oh.

Does that mean he's not
coming home for Christmas?

Uh... you know,
with all the search party,

I think he's afraid
to show his face around here.

That's too bad.

People are pretty forgiving.

Especially during the holidays.

Not everyone.

Hey, let's go
have some fun, huh? Come on.

Oldest trick
in the goddamn book.

You want to play games?

I can do this all fucking day.

You might have
all day, but I don't.

- Shit. This is great.
- Yeah. Right?

Small towns love them
some sport, huh?

I mean, what else
we gonna do, right?

Okay.

Uh, let's see...

That one...

All right.

- Put that ball right in here.
- All right.

All right, wait for me
to get down there.

Okay.

Okay.

All right, anytime.

Whoa!

Wow. Matt's got nothing
on you, huh?

Yeah, well, I led
the Mountain League

in batting my senior year.

Taught him everything...

he knows.
All right, that's enough.

Let's turn this thing off before
I hurt myself showing off.

You ever play?

- What, Jim never taught you?
- No.

All right.
Let's see what you got.

Summer camp.

Perfect place for
a serial killer

to make his stand.

All right. Batter up!

Sorry.

It's okay, you don't have
to apologize.

Okay. Here you go.

It's all right.

You just weren't taught right.

Y-You're swinging with
your wrists, all right?

Good instincts,
but you've got to use

your whole body, right?

You've got to step
with your legs.

Swing. Whole body.

There you go. Good.
One more time.

Step. Whole body.

All right, now, this time,
step, whole body,

snap your wrists. Ready?

Step, whole body, snap!

There you go. There.

You're not afraid,
are you?

- No.
- Good.

Now...

Ready?

Okay. Just... relax.

Keep your head down.
Eye on the ball, all right?

Ready?

Hey, attaboy!
Attaboy. All right.

Good, good, good.
Now, step into it.

Oh!

There we go.

Whew! Good God!

This is getting
too easy for you.

You know what?
Let's try a curve ball.

See how you handle that.

All right. Here we go.

You okay?

Yeah.

Yeah. I'm-I'm good.

All right.

Okay.

Turn it back on.

Sorry. I'm not the guy
you're looking for.

Put another one in.

And my own dad thinks I'm what?

A liar? An animal?

Again.

Again.

Again.

Again!

You are one tough fucking kid.

So, you ever had venison?

No, I... No, I've never had it.

Really? You mean the whole time
you've been here in Iron Lake,

Jim hasn't cooked you up
some venison?

Nope.

Oh. I don't know what the hell
he's waiting for.

Come on, we're gonna rectify
that situation right now.

All right. Let's go.

I also see some

quality Scotch
in your future.

I thought we were
headed to your place.

We are. I have a cabin
out this way.

Oh, cool.

Yeah. I do all my hunting
out here.

It's where I keep my venison.

It's nice, you know.
To have a place you can go

to get away, be yourself.

Yeah.

Hope he's as drawn
to blood as I am.

You said you had all day.

Well, I've got news for you.

The night is mine.

What's going on?
Everything okay?

Yeah. It's just...

You know what?
You were right.

I pushed everything aside
to deal with Iris.

I want to close out
all our files.

- Now?
- Yeah, I keep thinking about

that story you told me
about the opioid bust.

You mind bringing me up to speed
on that case?

Okay, um,
once we arrested Miles,

I got him to snitch on
his supplier.

Piece of shit
named Jasper Hodge.

I coordinated with the Staties
to make the arrest,

- but we got there too late.
- It was too late?

Yeah. When we went
to make the arrest,

he was already dead.

Accidentally OD'd
on his own product

while he was pressing pills.

How long had he been dead
when you found him?

About an hour before
we got there.

So... maybe Miles
tipped Jasper off

that the police were coming?

Maybe he OD'd because
he didn't want to spend

- all those years in prison?
- I don't think so.

I mean, when I brought Miles
and Jim into the station,

Miles gave up Jasper quick.

But we held Miles for 24 hours,

and Jasper was dead in ten.

How long did you keep Jim
in custody?

No more than an hour. I mean,
I wasn't trying to punish him.

I just wanted to make sure
he cooled off.

Stupid motherfucker took
a knife to a gun fight.

All right.

Yeah. Okay.

Christ! Who the hell are you?

Where does Kurt have my son?

Fuck you!
Okay. Okay. Okay.

I think Kurt's got him
up in his cabin on Stern road.

That's where I was to bring you.

That's all I know.

I was just doing my job.

No-Nothing personal.

We're talking about my son.

There's nothing more personal
than that.

Do you see this often?

Fentanyl overdose?
Are you kidding?

- By the guy making the pills.
- Eh, it happens.

He had, um,
ketamine in his system, too.

That could explain it.

- Was it lethal drug interaction?
- No.

A party drug.

Probably took it to mellow out.

- Made him sloppy.
- So, there's nothing to suggest

that Jasper's death was
anything other

than an accidental overdose?

Well, not unless
someone put a gun to his head

and made him snort a line.

Just want to check
one more thing.

- Fucking faster, Dex!
- I'm going as fast as I can.

- Text him. Warn him.
- It's risky.

- You have to let him know.
- I don't want to tip off Kurt.

This is the good stuff.

This is what they call
single malt Scotch whisky.

Best there is.
Only kind I drink.

- Thank you.
- Go ahead. Give it a shot.

Hmm?

Ooh. That kind of tastes
like a Band-Aid.

You want to put
some ice on that?

No, I'm good.

Mm.

Got to stop doing that
to yourself, kid.

I mean, look, I get it.

I-I used to do stuff like that
when I was your age.

But the sooner you stop
punishing yourself

for whatever you think
is wrong with you...

Look, all I'm trying
to say is that

you are who you are.

Find what gives you joy,
and you do that thing.

No apologies.

Whatever it is that brings you
pleasure in this world.

How do you...

H-How do you do that?

You just... take the leap.

Well, I have
worked up quite an appetite.

How about you?

Starving.

Whoo! This is gonna be tasty.

Uh, hey, I'm-I'm getting
a little cold.

Where's the firewood
for the stove?

Um, it's around the side of
the house. I'll get it.

Oh, no, no, no. I got it.

Come on, Harrison.
Come on. Come on.

You good?

Yeah.

You know, if it's getting late
and you need to be home,

I'm happy to give you a ride.

No. No way.

I wouldn't want to miss out
on all the venison.

Yeah, it's smelling
pretty tasty in there.

I'm glad we're doing this, kid.

Me, too.

All right. Hurry up.

Shit.

So I'm trying to make weight.

And I... you know. I start
wearing a-a garbage bag, right?

- Mm-hmm.
- And then go for a run.

I'm drenched in sweat,
I got terrible BO,

and I'm wearing
a frigging Hefty bag.

- Mm.
- I run around the corner,

and there she is,

- walking her dog.
- Oh, man.

I had been gearing up

to ask her to the Spring Dance
all week,

but, you know, at school,
there's always people around,

and I... I don't know.
I just kept pussying out.

- I get it.
- So, this time,

I say, "Okay, forget about it."

I'm-I'm gonna take my shot.

I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask her.
Right there, right then.

What'd she say?

Well, she looked me
up and down,

like I had just escaped
from a mental ward, and said,

"Do I look like I date
white trash?"

Just laid me out.

But you probably don't have
that problem.

You're going out with the police
chief's daughter, right?

Uh, I don't know.
After that last wrestling match,

I-I think she looks at me like
I just escaped a mental ward.

Well, you know, I guess some
people are just never

gonna understand guys
like you and me.

You know what I say?

Fuck 'em.

Yeah.

- Fuck 'em!
- Fuck 'em!

Attaboy.

Ah.

So... so-so what happened
with you going to jail?

W-What was that about?

Well, it was...

just a little mix-up
with some DNA.

Well, it turns out
that my dad

murdered a teenage girl
in Iron Lake 25 years ago.

- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

He was a really messed up guy.

Wasn't easy growing up being
his son, I can tell you that.

And I guess, you know,
since I spent the night

in jail because of him,
it still isn't easy.

Eh, you know.

Sometimes a kid
just ends up suffering

for the...
choices of his father.

So, hey, why did the dad that

abandoned you for ten years

end up getting in a fight
with you at my truck stop?

Oh, I-I don't even know
if it was a fight

as much it was just me

being pissed at him

- all the time.
- Ah.

I just feel like I keep wanting
something from him that...

What? What do you want, kid?

I don't know. I...

When I came here,
I wanted answers.

A-And now, as much as I...

fucking hate to say it...

I-I think I was also

looking for, you know...

Connection. Real connection
with your dad. Hmm?

Yeah.

But I-I think he knew.

Even when I was five,

I think, I think he knew

how different we were.

Yo, this is Harrison. Leave a
message and I'll hit you back.

Well, w-we don't get
each other on, like,

a-a normal,
father-son level.

I-I feel like he's always
holding something back from me,

or... I don't know.

Whatever blood-bond most fathers
have with their kids,

it's-it's not there.

Listen to me. You cannot
blame yourself for that.

That is on him.

Yeah.

Maybe it's his
childhood abandonment shit.

Maybe it's mine.

E-Either way,
I got my answer.

If you were my son,

I would never have
walked out on you.

Ever.

- Tha-Thank you for saying that.
- I mean it.

- Ah, damn.
- What's up?

Uh...

Just something I have to
take care of.

Okay. I'll be right back.

W-What are you doing?

Wish it could've worked out
differently.

But I don't have a choice, son.

Sins of the father.

It's a fucked-up world
out there.

- I-I don't...
- Get up.

Get out.

What-what-what,
did I say something wrong?

Did I do something?
I-I didn't mean to do anything.

J-Just tell me what I did
and I'll make it right.

I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.
I don't know what I did.

Please, Kurt.
Please don't hurt me.

I'm sorry.

Run.

Run!

Come on!
Get him out of the car!

I want him to see this.

Come on!

Oh, shit.

Harrison!

- Are you okay?
- I'm-I'm not hurt.

Where'd he go?

Come on.
Let's get out of here.

Ketamine...

How did you know we were there?

D-Did you know Kurt was...

What's-what's going on?

There's so much
I need to tell you.

I should've way before
it got to this.

You need to know.

What?

Before anything else,
you need to know

that you never have to feel
alone with your dark...

thoughts again.

You were probably
drawn to Kurt because

he seemed to understand you,
but I...

I was born in blood,
just like you.

I had the same violent urges
when I was your age.

Like you, I didn't know
how to deal with them.

But my dad taught me a code.

A way to channel those urges.

I'm gonna tell you everything.

This is all I had to do.

This is all he ever wanted.

Maybe, if I'm being honest...

maybe this is all
I ever wanted, too.

Welcome to Iron Lake.

Population:

2,760.

On the surface,
Iron Lake may seem

like the idyllic snow globe town

Norman Rockwell
would jerk off to.

But I came here
because an overprivileged,

cis, white boy
named Matt Caldwell

went hunting
in the woods one day

and never came back.

So, of course, everyone
lost their goddamn minds.




Especially Matt's father,

local legend Kurt Caldwell,

who claims his son
is still alive.

But if that's true,

where is he?

What unfolded next,
murder fiends,

was more than
any true crime podcaster

could ever dream of.

Dark secrets lurk
beneath Iron Lake,

and the more I do the deep dive,

the more I come up with.

At this rate,
I may never have to leave.

You're listening
to Merry Fucking Kill.

And now, a word...




This is Chief Angela Bishop,
Iron Lake P.D.

I need you to put out
an APB on someone

who's been missing for 72 hours.

All right, what's
the name of the missing person?

Molly Park.

Now I remember
why I picked this place.

So many good people.

Fred Jr, Pastor Brian.

Logan.

Teddy, Abraham.

Good folks.

All these people
working together to help me,

Mr. Serial Killer.

Make that
Mr. Serial Killer and son.

This fire is a sign.

If I'm going to teach
Harrison the Code,

it can't be here.

We need to talk.

Uh, sure thing.
You want to grab, uh,

- a coffee?
- No, we need to talk now.

Ah.

I just spoke to Gig.

There's strong evidence
that your fire was arson.

Slow, suspenseful music

Arson? Are you sure?

Yes. Yes, I'm sure.

'Cause Gig's been warning me
about that fire pit for...

Someone drenched your roof
with an accelerant,

most likely gasoline,

which makes this a crime scene.

Oh.

Why would someone do that?

Can you think of anyone
you crossed recently?

No one comes to mind.

It was probably those
Moose Creek douchebags.

Uh, a few of 'em tried
to jump me at the-at the

truck stop two nights ago.

- You were attacked?
- Yeah.

Did you get any names?

Uh, they were-they were friends
with that kid, Jeremy.

Uh, Zach or Scott
probably know who they are.

He truly is his father's son.

...I'm gonna need
physical descriptions

- Yo, Jimbo!
- and any other

details you can remember.

Anything here you want to keep?

Hey, thanks, Teddy.
This was my father's.

Jim!

Keep your phone on.

I'm gonna stay
and poke around a little more.

Heard about the fire.

Uh, took up a collection
to help out.

Aw, you shouldn't have.

You really shouldn't have.

We, uh, we wanted to get you
a little something special.

Thought you might
be able to use a new jacket.

Coach...

Hey, it's from all of us.

Yeah!

Gracias.

Para todo.

You guys are too nice
in this town.

Hey, it's your town, too.

There was a time
I would've given anything

to see him like this.

Aw, shit, he's gonna cry.

Happy. Embraced by friends.

Almost normal.

Okay, okay. Come on, come on.

Let's pack up the-the boxes
and put them in Jim's truck.

No, it's all good.
Harrison and I got it.

Thanks again.

You're too kind, really.

Takes a village.

So...

after last night,
we should probably figure out

where we want to live.

That makes sense.

Can't stay
at Angela's place forever.

Maybe somewhere warmer?

You mean away from Iron Lake?

That's what I'm thinking, yeah.

But-but I just got here.

I mean, I-I-I finally
feel like I fit in.

And you've done a great job,

but think about how good
a fresh start will feel.

What about Los Angeles?

It's kind of like Miami,
but without all that humidity.

It's 3,000 miles away
from my friends.

From Audrey.

I know it's hard,
but we can't be ourselves here.

We can't do what we do.

Come on.

So...

how does...

"what we do" work, exactly?

I mean, d-do we...

we see someone getting away
with murder, and...

uh, take care of them?

Something like that.

We'll research, make a list.

It's not hard to do
when you're in a big city.

And then, when our
Dark Passenger rises up,

we'll be ready.

Rises up?

Like during
your wrestling match,

when you broke that kid's arm.

Except, instead of hurting
someone innocent,

we bring justice
to someone who deserves it.

And save a lot
of innocent people.

Yeah.

Can we get a pool?

Yeah, we can definitely
get a pool.

So, uh, when are you
gonna tell Angela?

'Cause I-I need to tell Audrey.

I'll let you know
when the time is right.

Hey, could you follow up

on a few Moose Creek kids?

Harrison said they...

Harrison said they...?

Ange? Everything okay?

Slow, ominous music

All right.

No.

- Thank you.
- Hey, you got a little...

Dogs... you know.

Hey, you.

I hope pasta's okay.

It seemed, I don't know, cozy.

Can't-can't go wrong with pasta,

but you got to do it right.

Would you guys mind
going to Gig's

for some crushed red pepper
and parmesan?

Yeah. You got it. Come on.

Oh, and, uh,
caramel fudge ice cream?

Yeah, get two.
We all deserve it.

All right.

Is my cabin still burned down?

Very.

Any clues, culprit-wise?

Yeah, I guess not.

Well, have some wine.

Sorry to say,
it's a little bit...

smoky.

You okay?

Hey. Don't worry about me.

I am the phoenix.

I rise from the ashes.

Hey, tell me what's going on...

Turn around! On your knees!

Hands on your head.

Wh... You're taking the whole
role-playing thing

to the next level.

Shut the fuck up
and do what I say.

Okay.

What could she possibly know?

What the hell is this about?

'Cause there's at least
a few options.

Dexter Morgan,
you're under arrest

for the murder
of Matthew Stearn Caldwell.

Matt Caldwell's dead?

Get him the fuck
out of my house.

You have the right

to remain silent.
Anything you say...

Yes, okay, your chief already
told me to shut the fuck up.

"A Wolf at the Door"
by Radiohead

Let me back, let me back

I promise to be good

Don't look in the mirror

At the face you don't recognize

Help me, call the doctor,
put me inside

Put me inside

Put me inside,
put me inside, put me inside

I keep the wolf

From the door

But he calls me up, ooh

Ange...

Can we just talk?

Oh, we'll be talking. A lot.

And I'll never see them again

If I squeal to the cops

No-no-no, no

No, no-no-no

No-no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no-no

No-no-no-no

No-no-no-no, no-no-no

Someone else is gonna
come and clean it up

Born and raised for the job
someone always does

I wish you'd get up, get over

Get up, get over,
turn your tape off

I keep the wolf from the door

But he calls me up, calls me

On the phone,
tells me all the ways

That he's gonna mess me up

Steal all my children

If I don't pay the ransom

I'll never see them again

If I squeal to the cops

So I'm just gonna

Dad? What's going on?

Everything's gonna be okay.

Take a seat, Harrison.
I'll talk to you in a bit.

Just grab a seat, guys.

Do I need a lawyer? 'Cause...

Up to you.

For the record,
please state your name.

Jim Lindsay.

State your goddamn name.

Dexter. Dexter Morgan.

Hello, Dexter Morgan.

Hello, Chief Bishop.

Where were you the day
Matt Caldwell went missing?

I was...
at my cabin, alone.

Okay.

We've determined
that this person

- is Matt Caldwell.
- Yeah.

You remember when I came in

and identified that
distinctive rifle for you?

Yes. You're a good citizen.

I try to be.

Do you really have
no sense of sarcasm?

- No.
- Yes.

I... We never identified

the second person
out in the woods that morning.

What's interesting is

he has the same build as you,

the same rifle you own.

He even does that same
chin scratch thing you do.

Well, my body size is average,

- which means...
- I know what that means.

And dozens of people in
Iron Lake have that same rifle.

Hell, I personally sold
most of them.

And I don't really know
what you mean about...

...the chin scratch thing.

You know that Matt Caldwell
shattered his femur

in that boating accident
in Ohio?

I'd heard that. What about it?

These are

the type of screws and plate

used to repair
that sort of fracture.

Okay, and?

And I found them in my mailbox,

along with...

this note.

Come on, Ange,
you're better than this.

I found this...

in the ashes of your cabin.

Remember when I said these
are the type of screws and plate

used on surgeries like Matt?

I was being oblique.

They're not just the type.

These are the actual screws

and plate used on Matt.

They've got serial numbers, so

I called
the Cleveland Clinic and...

And that's why we're here.

And your working theory is...

You went for
your morning walk...

No, I was home all day,
except for work and...

...where you saw Matt
kill the white deer.

You two argued.

Not hard to do, considering
Matt was always an asshole.

Maybe he attacked you.
Maybe it was self-defense.

Or maybe you're jumping to
conclusions that aren't there.

And then Harrison
shows up out of nowhere...

...and you had to get rid
of Matt's body.

And what's your theory
on that one?

You burned it.

Smart.

Until it isn't.

'Cause here's the hitch.

Titanium...

...doesn't melt.

A fact I've become
painfully aware of.

I also have a theory.
You want to hear it,

or are you just gonna tell me
to shut the fuck up?

Kurt lied

about Matt being in New York.

And then he lied about Matt
being at that cabin of his.

And then Kurt stripped that
same cabin down to the studs

a day after your friend,
Molly and I were there.

So, it's not outside the realm
of good, logical theory

that Kurt killed Matt
for any number of

accidental
or intentional reasons.

You yourself said,
"Matt was always an asshole."

Then he needed someone to frame.

Why not the boyfriend
of the chief of police

who just arrested
and humiliated him?

Hell, Kurt probably
burned down my cabin

just so you'd find
that damn screw.

Don't you see? He set me up.

Ange...

he's trying to get back at you.

Look, you've been under
a ton of pressure lately.

And...

you just found your best
friend's body after so long.

You haven't even had a chance
to grieve for...

Don't you say her name!

Hey, hey.

Why don't we just give Jim...

Dexter... some time
to gather his thoughts?

We want to keep
this interview clean,

so it stands up in court.

- He's fucking with us.
- Maybe.

But his story seems to be just
on this side of plausible to me,

which means it'll seem plausible
to a jury and the D.A.

You don't know
the full fucking context.

And if there is
a full fucking context,

you might want to fill me in.

I can't.

I got to be sure this time.

- Teddy.
- Chief?

Bring Kurt Caldwell in.

- You got it, boss.
- Anything on the Molly Park APB?

Nothing yet, but I forwarded
the line to my cell.

Okay. Harrison.

Logan will bring you in
to see your father.

Just... five minutes, okay?

Thanks, Ange... Chief Bishop.

Audrey, you come with me.

Harrison.

Oh.

Sorry. Protocol.

Just hang tight.

- I'll give you some privacy.
- Thank you.

What the hell?

Angela thinks
I killed Matt Caldwell.

This has nothing
to do with Kurt. You're safe.

Hey, I've been in tougher spots.

I'll get out of this.

There's no way I'm leaving you.

I promise.

- Night, Logan.
- Good night, Esther.

Angela's got this... theory,
but it'll never hold up.

We'll be on the road
in a day or two.

Well, what am I supposed
to do till then?

Go find Tess at The Tavern.

She'll feed you
and give you a room.

- Okay.
- Come on, guys.

We'll get through this.

The world needs us.

I'll be waiting for you.

And I'll find you.

Hey.

Stay tough.

Turn around.
Hands behind your back.

You're a good man, Logan.

I hope you are, too,
for Harrison's sake.

I can't give you
all the details yet, but...

You know how Harrison told you
Jim wasn't his real name?

You said Harrison was high
and didn't mean it.

I didn't know it at the time,

but there's more to that story.

Like what?
What the hell is going on?

Honey,

I know this might be
hard to believe...

...but Jim is dangerous.

Dangerous?

Then why were you dating him?

Why'd you let him
into our house?

Sometimes people
aren't who you think they are.

Wait, Audz.

Go home.

Give Harrison some space.

Why? Is he dangerous too?

No.

Look...

I promise I will tell you
everything tomorrow.

Turn around.
Hands through the slot.

All right.

This is nuts.

It's really putting me
in touch with my fear

of Harrison growing up
without a father.

I know you've been there.

Go to the far side of the cell.

Tuna.

Huh. Some things never change.

I'm gonna go make sure
that Harrison is set up okay.

I'm not going anywhere.

And thank you.

Sons need their fathers.

Thanks for this.

Oh, you're doing me a favor.
Never fun eating alone.

I know this must be
really, really tough for you.

I'm not the one in jail.

I don't want to see Jim
go away, either.

Look, you got here around
the same time Matt disappeared.

Did you hear or-or see anything

that could help
exonerate your dad?

I-I wasn't in town yet, so I...

can't help.

Are you gonna finish your fries?

I should head back
to the station.

- Later, Coach.
- Yeah.

Thanks for stopping by.

Oh, and, uh,

try not to eat hamburgers
three meals a day.

I don't want you going up
too many weight classes

before wrestling starts
after New Year's.

Motherfucker.

Batista.

This is Chief Angela Bishop.

We met at that conference
in New York.

Chief Bishop.

Uh...

I hope I didn't give you
the wrong impression.

You know,
I'm a happily married man.

This is a police matter.

How can I help?

We've had some deaths
in Iron Lake

that are very similar
to an old Miami Metro case.

Do you remember
the Bay Harbor Butcher?

Cristo.
That was a gruesome one.

I looked at the autopsy photos
on the police database.

- So, you've seen the, uh...
- The dismemberments.

The whole thing.

What can you tell me
about Sergeant Doakes?

I sat next to him
every day for ten years.

Do you believe that he did it?

I did at the time, but there
were a few other theories.

My, uh, my ex-wife...

My old captain actually thought

it was someone else
in the precinct.

Who?

Dexter Morgan,
but he died years ago.

Chief Bishop?

Check your e-mail.

Okay. Hold on.

When was this taken?

Last month.

Madre de Dios.

Dexter Morgan is alive?

And is sitting in my jail cell.

Can I have your
old captain's name?

I'd like to speak with her.

She was...

she was murdered.

Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

Did you ever catch the killer?

Batista?

Where are you?

I'll be there
first thing tomorrow

with everything I've got.

What's up, Teddy?

Kurt Caldwell's
beat feet out of here.

Front door unlocked,
safe empty, closets cleaned out.

And guess what?
His gas truck's here.

Emptied out.
Still smells like fresh gas.

Can you stay
at Kurt's overnight?

Just in case he shows up.

You got it, Chief.

Oh... geez.

Put that lying son of a bitch
back in my office.

You're not done for the night?

Oh, I'm just getting started.

You might actually get away with
the Matt Caldwell murder charge.

- Because I didn't do it.
- Oh, you did it, all right.

But I'm not entirely sure
my case will hold up enough

to convince the D.A.
and then the jury.

But hear this and know this.

I will stake my career,
my family,

my everything...

that you're a murderer.

I'm worried about you.

I've got one word for you:

ketamine.

You picked up a healthy...
or unhealthy...

Amount from Dr. Patel.

Yeah, I needed it
for Vincent van Goat.

You know he was sick.

Do you recognize this man?

Yeah, it's the piece of shit

who sold the drugs
that almost killed my son.

We...

ended up having
an unfortunate encounter.

About that encounter.

Miles O'Flynn
testified to me that,

"Just before he started pounding
on me, he poked me in the neck.

Like, with a needle
or something."

That was the exact same day
you picked up the ketamine

and several syringes
from Dr. Patel.

You think I drugged him?

I saw Logan question him
in this very station.

There's no way he was drugged.

Only because Logan and Teddy

showed up at Crystal Bar
before you could do it.

God, believe what you
want to believe.

You worked forensics in Miami.

You've seen
autopsy photos before.

Yes and yes.

Jasper Hodge.

Okay, I have no idea
where you're going with this.

It's called...

- A weal mark.
- ...a weal mark.

I heard he died

of an accidental
fentanyl overdose.

I can't say I'm sorry.

He also had ketamine
in his system.

And only in his system.

None was found anywhere
in his house or his car.

- Well, I can't speak to that.
- Well...

...then speak to this.

Same weal marks.

Same drug showing up
in their tox report.

It's what we call a pattern.

And it's how I know that you,
Dexter Morgan...

...are the Bay Harbor Butcher.

The Bay Harbor Butcher

was Miami Metro Detective
Sergeant James Doakes.

Not everyone believes that.

Tomorrow you'll be arraigned
for the murder of Matt Caldwell.

I'm gonna do my best
to see that it sticks

and you get life without parole.

And then,

win or lose,

you're gonna have
a little reunion

with your old friend
Angel Batista.

Yeah.

I met him at that Cop-Con thing.

He's on his way up from Miami
as we speak.

We're gonna extradite
your ass to Florida

where you'll stand trial
as the Bay Harbor Butcher.

Florida.

A state with the motherfucking
death penalty.

Turn off the camera.

Why the hell would I do that?

I'll talk.

If you've got something to say,
just say it to the camera.

Listening.

What if I told you
you were right?

Well, then,
you'd be admitting to...

I'm not admitting anything.

I'm saying you were right

about Kurt Caldwell.

I can prove it.

Ange, you know in your heart

that Kurt killed Iris.

She was just his first.

He's been active for 25 years.

Very active.

What the hell are you
talking about?

Them.

Go to Kurt's cabin.

100 yards north
of the front door,

under a deadwood pile,
there's a hatch.

Open it, and you'll see
what real evil looks like.

I have dedicated
my entire life to this.

Yeah, and you've been met
with scorn and ridicule

at every turn because you've had
a gut feeling but no proof.

You go to that cabin,

and you'll finally have it.

Proof.

Fuck!

You turned off
the camera. What happened?

Put him back in his cell.

I've got to check something out.

- And that would be?
- Just fucking do it.

Harrison.

I-I came to get my stuff,

since it doesn't look like
we're gonna move in together.

Come in. Your stuff's upstairs.

I'm sorry.

I think this is all my fault.

How could this possibly
be your fault?

I told my Mom what you said
at the party.

If I had just kept
my mouth shut...

Th-This-this
isn't because of you.

Then what's going on?

No one will tell me
what's happening.

I know.

I just...

Want this to be over.

For things to go back to normal.

Normal...

What's that?

Things certainly weren't normal

when you and I were on track
to becoming brother and sister.

So, you think this arrest means
our parents are breaking up?

My dad told me
to wait at The Inn.

But it's really nice to see you.

Well, my mom said
to give you space.

But I guess we don't always have
to do what our parents want.

Remember when you thought
not killing was the problem?

How's that going for you?

I can figure this out.

Angela's got her teeth in you.

She's never gonna let go.

You did.

I was your sister.

I trusted you.

I loved you.

Angela's pretty fucking far
from that right now.

Enough!

Enough.

Hey, Logan,
can I get some water?

Kind of been doing
a lot of talking today.

Yeah.

You talked Angela
right out of the station.

I'd give anything to know
what you said to her

when the camera was off.

I don't want to hurt you.

So, Angela was right about you.

She's a good cop and so are you,

but this is inevitable.

So, just give me the keys.

Do it!

Don't be a hero, Logan.

I just need to get out
and see my son.

Good, good.
Good, good, good, good.

- Don't do that.
- Fuck you.

Damn it, Logan,
you should have listened to me.

Yo, Coach. Is my dad okay?

It's me.

Wh... Dad?

Where-where are you?

Come downstairs.
Meet me in front of the station.

Um, I'm at-I'm at Audrey's.

Okay, that's actually better.

Grab all your stuff.

My truck is in
Angela's driveway.

The key's in the cupholder.

Meet me where we found
the white deer.

I got it.

Sun's coming up. Go.

Now.

Oh!

Annie Kurtz?

Jennifer Nùñez.

Oh, my... oh, my God.

Shannon Luu.

Lily Kosnicki.

Molly.

Logan. Logan, are you there?

Logan, do you copy? Pick up.

That was faster than I expected.

Logan. We have multiple bodies.

Oh, fuck.

Fuck!

'Sup, Chief?

Get me state troopers, CSI,

the coroners,
the motherfucking FBI.

I found something like 30 bodies

at the Caldwell property
on Stearn Road.

I need all the backup I can get

before this place turns into
a fucking media frenzy.

Holy shit. Got it. On it.

Wait, Teddy.

Have you heard from Logan
in the past hour?

No. I think he's still
at the station with Jim.

Fuck! Fuck!

Dad.

Grab your stuff
and leave the truck. Let's go.

Are you hurt?

No. I'm okay. Come on.

Whose blood is that?

I'll explain everything later.
We need to go.

Now.

Wait.

You called me
from Logan's phone.

Is that his blood?

There was no other way.

Is Coach dead?

Isn't the whole point

that you only kill people
that deserve it?

Coach Logan's a good person.

He wouldn't cooperate.

It's the only way I could
get back to you. Come on.

Look, we'll talk
about everything,

I promise,

but this is it.
We got to get out of here.

Yeah.

Don't get caught.

That's only a part of it.
Harrison...

Shut up.

You don't really care
about saving anybody, do you?

You're just feeding
this-this Dark Passenger.

I-It's not even a passenger.

It's fucking driving.

And you like it.

You slashing Ethan

and breaking
that wrestler's arm...

That's your own darkness.

You're just like me, buddy.

No.

I wanted to be like you...

so bad.

But m-my anger
isn't because I'm like you.

My-my anger is because of you.

Of-of course I'm angry.

You didn't just make
the decision to abandon me once.

You made that decision
every single day

you stayed away for ten years!

Well, I'm still your dad,
and I'm here now.

I'm right here.

Just come with me, buddy.

I can stop.

I can do it, with your help.

I'm not your fucking caretaker.

I'm your goddamn son.

I want...

I need to be with you.

You have to turn yourself in.

There's no other way.

If I do,
I get the death penalty.

Maybe you deserve it.

Okay.

You don't have to come with me.

But I can't stay here.

Would my mom still be alive
if it weren't for you?

Would Aunt Deb still be alive?

And me...
would I be so fucked-up?

Open your eyes
and look at what you've done!

You're right.

I don't...

I don't want to be right.

I...

I just... I want to be normal.

I'm sorry for everything
I've done to you.

You deserve better.

A better life.

A better father.

You have to take the safety off.

Just like I showed you.

This is the only way out.

For both of us.

Now...

deep breath.

I've never really felt love.

Real love.

Until now.

You did good.

Drop the rifle! On your knees!

Hands where I can see them!

I'm... I stopped...
He-he killed Coach Logan.

I know.

It's okay. You can get up.

Okay.

Take this.

Go through town,
just past the Truck Stop

is the entrance to I-86 west.

Go, and never come back here.

Harrison.

You need to do this now.

Uh, tell Audrey I said goodbye.

I can't.

Why?

Because I haven't seen you.

This is Chief Bishop.

I'm calling to report
an officer-involved shooting.

My dearest Hannah,

this is the most difficult
letter I'll ever write.

You may have seen my name

among the casualties
of Hurricane Laura,

and I believe
that's for the best.

I'd give anything to see
you and Harrison again.

To see him smile.

To hold him.

I celebrate his birthday
in my heart.

"I Should Live in Salt"
by The National

He is and always will be
my phantom limb.

Don't make me read your mind

You should know me

Better than that

It takes me too much time

You should know me

Better than that

You're not that much like me

You should know me

Better than that

We have different enemies

You should know me
better than that

I should leave it alone

But you're not right

I should leave it alone

But you're not right

I want what every father wants:

for his child to be happy.

To live and love without fear.

To share his gifts
with the world.

I should leave it alone

But you're not right

But we both know that,
with me around,

a normal life for Harrison
won't be possible.

I should live in salt
for leaving you

Behind

Behind

This is not an easy decision.

Sometimes I wish
the hurricane had taken me,

released me from the burden
of my own urges.

Instead, it showed me
that I have to bear them alone.

That's my fate.

So, unless Harrison starts
showing any dark tendencies,

I beg you...

I should live in salt
for leaving you...

Let me die

so my son can live.

Behind
