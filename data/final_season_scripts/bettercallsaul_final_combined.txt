Good morning, Don Juan.

Lalo Salamanca is dead.

Gunmen broke into his hacienda
last night.

Hired operators
from the look of it.

It was messy.
Very messy.

As for the Salamancas...

"Sangre por sangre."

Yes.
That is the Salamanca way.

We are on the verge of chaos.

But who did this?

One minute, I hear talk
of the Colombians,

the next... traitors.

Traitors close to home.

We know this much.

Ignacio Varga is a rat.

Don Eladio has put a price
on his head.

Every man we have
is searching for him.

When Varga's found, we'll know
who he was working for.

I assume Don Hector
has been told.

I called him myself.

As for if he understood me,
quién sabe.

Listen to me.

You must be careful, Gustavo.

This is a dangerous time.

No one is above suspicion.

I understand.

Good.

[Line disconnects]

[Door opens]

[Door closes]

Gus: Tell me again
about the sicario

who made the final report.

He was already wounded
when he talked to our cut-out.

Federales found him
dead at the scene.

But they got Salamanca.

The mercenaries are dead.

To a man.

And yet their mission
was a success.

It has been known to happen.

I could go down there and
get Varga, bring him home safe.

There's ways to do it
on the quiet.

[Sighs, clears throat]

Unless you already have
something in the works.

[Door opens]

[Door closes]

Speak your mind.

Loyalty goes both ways.

Varga has done everything
you asked him.

He wasn't given a choice. Maybe so.

But he played a tough game
and he played it on the square.

And?

When all is said and done...

The kid deserves your respect.

[Inhales deeply]

He has it.

Is there more you wish to say?

[Door opens]

[Door closes]

[Whirring]

I hope this brings your guy
more luck than it brought me.

You good?

I'm great.

[Elevator bell dings]

Detective!
Miss Khalil.

Good morning.

I've been calling you
for two days.

Oh.
My girl's out sick.

What can I do you for?

Tomorrow morning.
10:00 a.m.

Brunch?
With just you and me, right?

I mean, won't the big fella here
feel like a third wheel?

You and I are meeting Parson
in chambers.

I am asking
for an emergency hearing

to alter the terms
of De Guzman's release.

[Chuckles]
Sounds like a blast.

Unfortunately, I'm booked solid.

I checked your client's
place of residence.

The address he gave?

It's a Dairy Queen
in Alta Monte.

The family that showed at the
bail hearing can't be located.

No driver's license,
no tax rolls,

no school records.
Nothing.

Fact is, there isn't
a single Elizabeth McKinnon

under the age of 73
living in New Mexico.

Well, this is...
This is surprising.

Your client has disappeared,

and I'm not waiting six weeks
to start looking for him.

Hey, my guy put up
seven million in bail.

You think he's just
gonna walk away from that?

Who comes up with
seven million bucks in cash?

You know what I think?

I think the family was fake,

and I think you knew it
the whole time.

Hold on. Look, just get real
for a second.

The hearing didn't go your way,

and now you're trying
for a do-over.

You say my guy ran?

I say he's got seven million
reasons for showing up...

When he's legally required
to do so.

So, no,

I won't be, uh,
due process window dressing

at any crash meeting
with Parson.

And if you try throwing
any of this crap around

in front the judge
without my presence...

Here's an accusation.

Prosecutorial misconduct.

Career-ending
prosecutorial misconduct.

[Scoffs]None of that changes the fact

the guy's not
who he said he was. No, no, no. Hold on.

You guys got caught with
your pants around your ankles

and somehow that's on me?

I don't think so.

You've got two dozen lawyers
up there,

you got investigators, you got
the whole damn police force...

And it's my fault
you can't keep track of Lalo?

That is not my job!

Lalo?
Who's Lalo?

What?
What did I say?

[Sighs]

I meant De Guzman.
I have more than one client.

[Chuckles]
So [Clears throat]

I will see you at
the preliminary in six weeks.

As scheduled.

Until then,
I have clients who need me.

Richie Rich says,

a top-dollar defense

Joe. You must do this.

You must must must.

Love, that's a
trap."

Get in!
We need to reshoot!

300 bucks for 90
minutes! C'mon!

Uh, I
have a break an hour.

Or maybe... No,
you're not hearing me,

400 bucks if you get
in the car right now.

And... And I will set
your boss straight

if he gives you
any grief.

I-I will sue his ass
for wrongful termination

and age discrimination
if he fires you.

Hey, hey, hey, come
here, come here.

How often do we get a chance to
use our craft and shine, huh?

To really slide inside the
skin of yet another human being

and make the kind of magic that
other people only dream of?

Now, listen!

Seize the day. Carpe diem.

Don't live with regret.

"Let nothing stand
in your way."

There's the spirit that
takes people places.

Come on. But buckle up.

I don't wanna lose you
through the windshield.

This... is a Canon XL2.

Three CCD, top-of-the-line,
the crème de la crme.

20-time optical zoom,

but also has interchangeable
XL lens capability.

Image stabilization,
built-in filters...

Variable frame rates, multiple
aspect ratios, your choice.

Well... it wouldbe
your choice,

if any of you were
allowed to use it.

This here is what professional
videographers use.

This is for art.

This... is not for you.

Thisis for you.

340 lines of so-called
resolution...

suitable for recording your
sister's second wedding,

local community board meetings,

or porn mit-out plot.

Yeah, hello. Excuse me.

Professor Tanis said that we'd
have access to the good cameras.

Oh.

Professor Tanis said that.

Well, Professor Tanis does
not represent the views

of the equipment center.

Irepresent the views of
the equipment center.

Okay? So... the
"good" cameras?

Those are for the few.

The proud.

The auteurs.

Capisce?

Okay, these are, uh,
depth-of-field charts.

Study them.

Don't get lost in the
Circle of Confusion.

Can't tell your story if you
can't keep things in focus.

And, uh, I have some very
important responsibilities

elsewhere on campus,
but I'll be back.

And, fair warning, there's
gonna be a quiz later.

Probably.

Don't touch the
equipment! I'll know.

What are you
doing teaching a class?

I told you, we have zero time.

You have time to discuss my fee?

"Discuss your fee?"
Your fee is your fee.

That's right, and in this
emergency situation where I'm...

Where I'm pulled from
my collegiate duties,

my fee's $500.$500?! What?!

We did the same job
last week for $100.

If you think this is the same,
feel free to go find someone else.

What? No. $500! Fine! Jesus.

Five. Pinky promise?

Pinky, all the fingers.

Just... don't tell the others.

Right choice. You're
paying for the best.

The best ass reaming.
That'd be extra.

Okay. We're gonna
shoot over here,

trees in the background,
throw it out-of-focus.

That work? I'll make it work.

How's my boy looking? Oh,
I-I-I think better today.

I used a foundation that's a
little closer to his skin tone,

and I found a spirit
gum that isn't so gunky,

so it makes the moustache
look more natural.

I like it, looks
good... Yeah, hold on.

You wander too far
from the Shire?

We're in rehearsals.

It's a live action musical
tribute to "The Dark Crystal."

I'm Kira, the Gelfling.

Pretty sure it's
pronounced "Barf-ling."

Okay. Leave her alone. Just
set up what you gotta set up.

Gotta go get my stuff, chief.
No, it's taken care of.

- I'm here! I'm here!
- That's the face. Look serious.

I just grabbed everything. Hi.

I got three rolls
of Tri-X and Plus-X

'cause I didn't know which one you'd want...
Wait, wait, wait... You touched my stuff.

Nobody touches my stuff but me!
Truer words were never spoken.

Okay. Get it in gear.
We're on a deadline.

Thank God...

You're sure of this?
Absolutely sure?

We want it to look right, right?
Yeah, I know, but Ican do it.

I mean, I was around your cast
almost as much as you were.

Here, gimme the bag.
You get back in the car,

bust the speed limit, and you'll
still make that lunch.

Jimmy. This is where
I need to be.

- Is my light meter in here?
- It's in there.

Hello, Lenny, can
I have your, uh...

Left arm. Left arm?

Of course. What's...?

Your character has
a broken arm now.

- It's not here. It's not here.

The plot thickens. This changes
everything. Nothing changes.

- Did you grab my NDs?
- I grabbed everything.

Well, I-I must have
a new backstory.

Can you just hold your
arm still, though?

- I don't see them.
- Check the side pocket.

Think of the broken
arm as symbolic.

- Ahhhh, I see. Symbolic.
- Got 'em.

- Going with the Plus-X.
- Try not to talk, Lenny.

Your character motivation
remains exactly the same.

You're on a covert mission to
accept a very important package,

and you want to play it casual,
okay, but knowing, you know?

An air of mystery,
intrigue, conspiracy...

You know what? Probably best
if you just look sleepy.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

That supposed to be a cast?

Jimmy: C'mon, guys,
clock's running. Let's go.

- Hey. Hands.
- Thanks.

Are you kidding
me? Dude, c'mon,

that's a $36 cloth
camera tape from Rafik.

Bill us.

Almost there. Keep it steady.

Keep it steady! Morning light!

Aces on the foli-áge.Okay.

Go!

Action!

No, guys, we can't see it!

You have to turn
so you can see it!

You have to... No, turn
it so that we can...

No, the envelope... When you...

What?! Turn!

What? Is she...
What is she saying?

Camera Guy: Camera reload!

Okay, um, Lenny, just...

Okay, um, Lenny, why
don't you try, um,

walking behind the bench, and,
Jimmy, pass it back to him?

Right, but, yeah, keep
the envelope like...

No, more like flat. Flat?

You know, to the
camera. Okay, yep.

But not too obvious. Got it. Go.

Shoes! Shoes in the shot!

Crap.

Okay. Okay.

Okay. All ready?

Okay, action again!

What are we looking at here?

Can't rush the process.

As long as there's an image,
it doesn't have to be perfect.

Can't rush the process.

Alright.

That one? Uh-huh.

That there? And this one.Okay.

That one. That one.

Yeah. Looks good.

Yeah.

Okay.

Ooh. Got it.

What's that?

Don't worry about it.

You're "need-to-know"
on this one.

Okay.

Okay.

Oh, God, God, oh, God.

Go! Go!

Uh...

excuse me, Mr. Hamlin.

I-I was told I should restock
the fridge before the meeting.

No worries.

Here.

Mm. Let me give you a hand.

Thank you.

Uh, you're... Gary?

Cary. Anderson.

Mm. Of course. Cary.

Cary, what happens when you
drop or shake a can of soda?

Right.

Boosh.

I'm sorry, I-I'm, uh...

Here. Let me show
you a little trick.

Something about the
centrifugal force.

It pulls the bubbles from
the inside of the can,

stops it from exploding.

Don't want our clients to
get a surprise, now, do we?

That works?

Oh. Alright.

You know who taught
me that trick?

He used to do it, out of habit.

Any time he opened a can,
almost unconsciously.

I asked him about it once.

Just his way of being
prepared for anything,

accidental or otherwise.

Um. I'm sorry, I'm
kinda new here.

I have to ask...
who... who is that?

Hamlin: Charles McGill.

The "M" in HHM.

The greatest legal
mind I ever knew.

Wow.

I hope someone says
that about me someday.

Well...

maybe there are more
important things.

Mr. Genidowski is here.

Now? I told him
you have a meeting.

All the parties are here? Rich
Schweikart and his team are running late.

They just phoned,
about 10 minutes out.

Genidowski say what he wants?

Just that there's
been a development.

Said you'd know what he means.

Sorry about that. They're
fresh out of the bath.

What am I looking at?

Took those about
7:00 this morning.

McGill sat on a bench
in Trumbull park,

then the subject you see there

passed by and collected
a package from McGill,

tucked it in his sling.

Didn't realize what it was
until I saw the photos up close.

Oh, my God.

Same envelope.

And the man with the moustache?

I was hoping you'drecognize him.

I don't, but...

What can you do
to find this man?

I know he drives a silver Miata,
and I got a partial plate.

Not perfect, but enough.

It'll take some extra man-hours,

and I might have to grease
some wheels over at MVD...

Do it.

Whatever needs to be done.

I'm on it.

Mrs. Landry: Now, the secret

to a really good
potato and leek soup...

It's not the potatoes,
it's the leeks.

You have to leave
them a little chunky.

Oh, well, I love leeks.

Oh, and garlic helps, too.

That
sounds delicious.

I really hope I get
a chance to try it...

Irene! How are you, my dear?

I'm very good, Mr. Hamlin.

Now, you know to call me Howard.

And you remember
Julie, of course.

Yes. I was just telling Irene

she doesn't have to
do or say anything,

and there's nothing
to be nervous about.

Well, Cliff is absolutely right.

Uh, uh, Julie,
can you pour Irene

a hot cup of chamomile
tea, a touch of honey?

That's how you like it,
right? Yes, thank you.

Irene, let me walk you through
what's going to happen.

You're going to meet

Mr. Schweikart and
his associates,

who represent
Sandpiper's interests,

and it's all going to be
very polite and professional,

and to make sure it stays polite
and professional... Mm-hmm.

An independent mediator is
going to keep things that way.

Kind of like a referee.

Yeah, a very nice retired
judge out of Santa Fe,

Judge Casimiro, I've known
for many, many years.

Oh, thank you. You're so
sweet. Thank you.

- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my goodness.

I'm just so glad this is
all going to be over soon.

Well, we all know the saying,

"The wheels of justice
turn slowly..."

Things probably
won't be over today.

Uh, there's a chance, but
we're fighting very hard

to get you and your
friends what you deserve,

and the other side's fighting
hard for their clients,

so this is one very
big, very important,

and very slow step
towards justice.

Full disclosure, we're probably
looking at... what, Cliff?

Oh, I'd have to say 1
1/2 to 2 years, minimum.

Of course, you're the
class representative,

and if you hear a deal of your
liking today... Oh, no, no, no, no.

I-I am not going to do anything

that you don't tell me to do.

Well, we will advise you
to the best of our ability,

I can assure you of that.

All
the parties are here,

and Erin has the out-of-state
reps dialed in on the Polycom.

Main: Fantastic.
And Judge Casimiro?

In the waiting area,
ready to come in

once we're all assembled.

Excellent. Well,
this is it, then.

We'll freshen this up for you in
the conference room. Thank you.

Now, let's get you
down there in style.

Um, I'm fine walking.

Of course.

I'd feel better
making all of this

as easy for you as possible.

Thank you for
indulging me, Irene.

Now, is there anything else
to make you comfortable?

Are you hot?

No, I'm very comfortable.

Anybody else hot?

Ummm... I'm good.

And I believe we're
just moments away...

And here they are.

Good afternoon, everyone.
The team has entered room

along with your class
representative, Irene Landry.

Howard.

Cliff, good to see you. Rich.

Yeah. You remember
Alvin and Phil... Hi.

And this is Daniela and
Edwina from Sandpiper.

Of course, great
to see you again.

Rich, I don't think
you'vemet Irene Landry.

No, I haven't, but it's nice
to put a face to a name.

Hello, my dear.
Rich Schweikart.

It is so nice to
meet all of you.

There are so many people.

Julie, I think it's time
to invite in the mediator.

Right away.

Hang tight, everyone,

now that all the
parties are here,

the mediator will
be invited in...

Um...

Hamlin: Congratulations are in
order, I hear. Whoops, hello?

I read the... Hello?
We still have everyone?

Schweikart: That was a bear
of a case. Terrific outcome.

Hello? Did we lose anyone?

Well, truth be told, I had
Alvin here do the heavy lifting.

Ms. Valco in Provo,
you still on the line?

Had a case before
O'Dwyer... Uh, copyright.

Smart guy. Can you
unmute and let us know?

Phil, didn't you second-chair
a trial in front of O'Dwyer

a month after you joined us?

Phil: More or less.
Thrown into the deep end.

Ms. Valco: Yes, I'm here, Miss Brill.
Hamlin: Good training for trials.

Great. Um, well, if any
of you get disconnected,

just dial back on the same
number you were provided,

followed by the access
code, then press pound...

And who rose through the ranks faster than
you, huh?...the little tic-tac-toe button,

and you'll jump right
back in.

And it looks like our
mediator has arrived,

so we'll get started. We've got you
right there at the head of the table.

Is there anything I can get you?

I'm absolutely fine, thank you.

I am a pencil and
notepad person.

All I need.

Hello.

I know we're all anxious
to get things started,

but you'll have
to suffer through

my traditional
spiel, unfortunately.

My name is Rand Casimiro,

and I am your mediator
for these proceedings.

Now, I'm happy to be here,
but at the end, hopefully,

all of you in the room

and those listening
from various locations

won't be happy with me.

And why do I say that?

Because the best
solutions mean compromise.

It's compromise from both
sides. That's my goal.

But as my wife always says...

Compromising doesn't mean
I'm right and she's wrong.

So let us move forward
with the b... Shhhh-huh.

Howard?

I, um...

wow.

I'm...

I'm sorry.

I don't think we can proceed
with these negotiations today.

Schweikart: Why not?

Let's just say... circumstances
beyond any of our control.

Well, I'm going
to have to insist

that you be more specific.

Well, our mediator here keeps
using the word "compromise"

when he, in fact,
is compromised.

I beg your pardon?

I think you heard me.

Main: Howard...

You drive a silver
Miata, correct?

I do.

And this morning,
around 7:00 a.m.?

You walked across
Trumbull park in town.

No.

You didn't stop at
the park this morning.

I didn't.

I got to Albuquerque
early, not at 7:00 a.m.

And I didn't go to
a park. You're sure.

Howard, if the judge
says he's sure, then I...

Of course I'm sure.

If it matters, I arrived
in town about 10:00.

I stopped at a gas station.

I went by a liquor
store and bought a gift.

I had a lunch salad
and a very nice latte

from the Flying Star on Menaul.

I read Barron's.

Then came here.

Hamlin: Mm.

So you weren't in town

to visit our mutual
acquaintance,

James Morgan McGill.

Or maybe you know him
as "Saul Goodman."

I don't know anyone by
either of those names.

Okay. You want to go that way?

Julie, go to my desk, please.

There's an envelope...
with photos.

Bring it to me, quickly.

O-Okay.

Howard, can we have a sidebar?

I'm sorry, these
photos.

These are photos
of me?

They show exactly
what I'm describing.

You were following me?

I had a private investigator
following Jimmy McGill.

You were photographed
receiving what I estimate to be

a $20,000 payoff this
morning in the park.

I-I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, this is just...

You recommended this judge
as a mediator, and we agreed,

and now... Jimmy...

Jimmy McGill, who... Who
originated this suit is...

What? A-Admittedly,

i-it all sounds a bit baroque,

but when you see the photos,
things will be clearer.

Well, I'm looking
forward to that.

Julie: I have
the pictures, Mr. Hamlin.

Hamlin: Thank you, Julie.

And now...

Take a look.

Is that supposed to be me?

I, uh...

This is...

This is not...

Julie, you got the
wrong envelope.

That was the only one on
your desk. Look again.

They... They've been switched.

Somehow he switched
them. Howard...

No, Jimmy, he snuck
in somehow, and...

These are not the
pictures I saw.

Mr. Hamlin, are you alright?

Your eyes... I am fine!

This is all something
that will be sorted out,

I am confident.

I think a recess is in order.

Nobody move!

Evidence has been tampered
with. Now, Howard. Please.

Is this how these usually go?

What are you doing?! I told you,

this is a campaign by Jimmy to take
me down... You are blowing this.

You need to take a
long, deep breath

and apologize to everyone for
what you just did. Of course.

I'll call my P.I. He has the
negatives.

Listen to me... No, no, no. The
original photos will prove everything.

Howard... Just
wait. You'll see.

Okay. Uh, this isn't...

Alright, I'm going to figure
out what the hell is happening.

Howard.

Judge... I...

I don't know what to say.

I suppose...

there really is nothing tosay.

Best of luck, Cliff.

Erin Brill: If everyone
could just stay on the line,

that would be preferable.

The situation here is fluid,

and we will update you
as soon as possible.

Uh, we've, um...

we've reconsidered our position.

We're going back to
our previous offer.

That stands until end of day.

And tomorrow, we
reduce it by a million,

and then another million
the day after that.

Our best to Howard.

Did you call a doctor?

One
is on the way.

Hamlin: Cliff? Is that you?

I'm not crazy. And
I'm not on drugs.

Please, come in...

Now, somehow, someway,
that son of a bitch

gave me something that
dilated my pupils.

I don't know what, but
it's wearing off already.

Look.

You say that Jimmy
McGill drugged you.

How is that possible?

The photos, they were
wet with... something.

The missingphotos.

Yeah, my P.I., Genidowski.
He had to have been in on it.

He... He must have shown
me one set of photos,

and then switched them
after I left the office.

Howard... Three weeks ago,

Julie got a call from
our detective agency.

They wanted to update
their contact info...

So, of course, she changed
the number in the system.

But it turns out...
It wasn't them.

That was Jimmy.

So when I needed an
investigator to follow Jimmy,

I called hisfake
number and hisfake man.

She just dialed the old number,

and of course, got
the actual agency.

And, no surprise,

no one by the name of Genidowski
had ever worked there.

I hired a con man.

I got played...

every step of the way.

I know what it sounds like,
but you have to believe me.

I...

It doesn't matter.

Rich went back to
the previous offer.

I'm going to recommend to
the class that we take it.

No.

No way.

We do not let Jimmy win this.

Why would Jimmy even do this?

He's a profit participant, this
means less money for him...

Because he's a child.

He wants his money now.

He begged me months
ago to settle.

You know what he does.
Whatever the truth is,

we'll never get back to where
we were before mediation.

We have to settle.

I'm lead attorney.

And I won't sanction
that decision.

Then I'm obligated
to go to the partners

and explain
everything I've seen.

All of it.

You think you're going to
be able to convince them

it was all Jimmy McGill?

Okay, then, we go to trial.

Cliff, this case is
incredibly strong.

I put this thing in front of a
jury, then everybody will know...

I'm not thinking about you, Howard.
I'm not thinking about Jimmy.

I'm thinking about the time,
the expense, the uncertainty.

I'm thinking about our clients.

Main: Hello, everyone.

Thank you for your patience,
and sorry for the wait.

This is Clifford Main,
lead counsel, speaking,

and I'm here with
some good news.

An offer's been made and
accepted by Mrs. Irene Landry,

which is going to make all of
you, I believe, very satisfied.

Eh.

Mother-of-All meth labs.

Adiós.

Casa Tranquila.

I'm sorry,

I'll have to find someone
who speaks Spanish to help...

Oh, no, it's fine. Just...

I'm looking to speak to
one of your residents.

Hector Salamanca?

I'm a relative.

Of course, just a moment.

Casa Tranquila.

Yeah, sorry, I think, um,
I lost the connection.

I'm trying to reach
Hector Salamanca.

Yes, sorry about that.

Let's try that again. Hold on.

Hello? Yes. Here's Hector.

Lalo: Hector?

Tío. Tío.

Michael.

Reporter: and that's great,

if you can all scooch
in just a little more.

Mm-hmm. And look at my
hand, big smile, guys...

And that's great.
Thank you, everyone.

Executive Director: Oh, Gustavo,
we can't thank you enough

for being such a friend
to Youth Development.

Hey, it's not only me.

Every Pollos Hermanos
employee is committed

to giving these young
people the opportunity

to reach their
fullest potential.

Can you say more about why
you chose this organization?

I think of the guidance
that I had as a child.

If we can make an impact early,

we not only help the children,
but we help the world.

Uh, if you would excuse
me for just a moment.

Oh, of course.

When?

20 minutes ago.

Now, you're gonna need
to cut this short.

Too many civilians, kids...

I've got guys sweeping
outside right now,

but this is an
uncontrollable situation.

He would not attack me here.

Mm.

You wanna bet the farm on that?

We need home court advantage,

which is you in the safe house

and him thinking you're alone.

You need to get in your
car and drive calmly home,

business as usual.

We'll be hidden, but we'll be
on you every step of the way.

I've pulled guys off all
the low-priority targets

to cover you. The laundry?

Tyrus is there with his crew.

Aside from that,

it's all hands on
deck at your house.

The trap is set.

Salamanca shows up,

he goes down.

Man: Notthe pope...
Alexander Pope.

Woman: "The proper study..."

Man: "Of mankind is man."

"of mankind is man." 'Course,
that means women, too.

Yes. Yes, I know.

I've been doin' some studyin'
of a different mankind lately,

like the ones you told
me...

Thomas Jefferson last week, and this week, Tom
Paine. Y'know, we don't have to get it.

We should probably
get this over with.

I'll get it.

Just in case Max Schmeling comes
in swinging.

Hamlin: Can I come in?

Yeah. Come in.

Kim.

Howard.

You doing okay?

I'm fine.

Sorry to, uh,
interrupt... this...

But I brought you a gift.

A gift? What's the occasion?

Your brother and I, we
always had a meeting

with "Mr. Macallan"
after a big victory.

Usually some brilliant
summation by Chuck...

That goes without saying.

So this...

Uh, this is for you.

You earned it.

You won.

Won?

Uh, what'd I win?

I get it.

Of course you... you both
have to play it this way.

You're both
so very good at it.

It's late, Howard.

Do you wanna tell us
what this is about?

I was wondering that, too.

What it's all about.

I mean, what do you
tell yourselves?

What justification
makes it okay?

"Howard's such an asshole
that he deserves it"?

We're good.

So...

...what is it?

I sided with Chuck too often?

I took away your office,
put you in doc review?

All of the above?

Howard's daddy helped
him get to the top,

but you both had to struggle.

"Howie has so much,
and we have so little,

let's take him
down a peg or two"?

What allows you
to do this to me?

Because this isn't just a prank.

No.

This goes beyond throwing
bowling bars on my car.

This took planning.

Coordination.

I mean, how many weeks?

O-Or was it months?

It couldn't have been easy.

So, tell me... why?

Why go through
this elaborate plot

just to burn me to the ground?

Burn you to the
ground?

Howard, come on.
Y-You'll be fine.

You always land on your feet.

Yeah, sure. The
Sandpiper settlement?

HHM's share will be
substantial, absolutely.

Even though I humiliated myself.

And my clients and
peers will whisper

that Howard Hamlin's a drug
addict... you're right.

I've worked my
way through worse.

Debt. Depression.

My marriage falling apart.

Oh, yeah.

I've been sleeping
in the guest house

for the better part of a year.

Ah, just one more thing good
ol' Howard has to work through.

But, yes, I
will land on my feet.

I will be okay.

But you? Far from it.

You two...

You two are soulless.

Jimmy, you can't help yourself.

Chuck knew it.

You were born that way.

But you?

One of the smartest and
most promising human beings

I've ever known... and this
is the life you choose.

Jimmy: Alright, you're
too tight to drive.

I'm calling you a cab. Oh,
good. Phony compassion.

Let's go. No, very, very
believable, but I'm far from done.

Oh, no, no, no. You
aredone, Howard.

Sorry, but you
need to stop this now,

and you need to go home.

You're perfect for each other.

You have a piece missing.

I-I thought you did
it for the money,

but now it's... it's so clear.

Screw the money.
You did it for fun.

You get off on it. You're...
You're like... Leopold and Loeb.

Two sociopaths.
Alright, that's enough.

No, you know it's true... you just
don't have the guts to admit it.

Great, now you need to go. I'm
going to make it clear to everyone,

because I'm going
to dedicate my life

to making sure that
everybody knows the truth.

Believe it.

You can't hide who you
really are forever.

How?

Kim: H-Howard.

Howard.

Howard, you need to leave.

Who are you?

Me? Nobody.

I just need to
talk to my lawyers.

Oh, is that right?
You want some advice?

Find better lawyers.

Howard, please. J-Just...
Just turn around.

No, no, no, no,
no. Take your time.

What's this about?

Please.

Ple... Uh...

Please, just tell
us what you want.

Well, like I said.

To talk.

I, uh...

think I'm in the
middle of something.

Uh...

T-There's really no need to...

Oh, shit!

Kim: Howard! Aw, shit!

Oh, my God! Please, no!

Oh, my God! Shh.

No, no! Shh. Shh.

Sh-sh-sh-sh-shhhhhh...

Okay.

Let's talk.

Saul: The word is out.

I have actual paying clients.

Here it is, violence!
It always comes to this!

You know what's coming next.

And now, the series finale
of "Better Call Saul."

Previously on
"Better Call Saul..."

Thought you might want to know
I'm still alive.

You should turn yourself in.

We're both too smart
to throw our lives away

for no reason.

I'm glad you're alive.

Bernalillo County

No remaining witnesses

other than my ex-husband.

standing in my kitchen,
threatening me.

He's a wanted man
and his name is Saul Goodman.

Slow down.

You're gonna make yourself sick.

You know...

we're sitting on
seven million bucks here.

Literally.

And...?

I say we take it,

split it fifty-fifty,

take off.

It's not ours.

Could be.

Yeah, well, I know some people

who would have a problem
with that.

Them?

Don't worry about them.

You feeling right?

First thing we do,

take six million bucks
and build a time machine.

Those people that
you're worried about?

They'll never find us.

Where would you go first, huh?

You... You look like a
history buff, right? Hm.

What, would you go
to Civil War times or...

um, Ancient Rome?

Oh, Christ.

Mm. Hmm.

December 8, 2001.

Why?

No. No.

Day I took my first bribe.

And then I'd go forward.

There's some people I'd like
to check on in five or ten years,

make sure they're doing okay.

You?

It's easy.

May 10, 1965.

That's the day Warren Buffett
took over at Berkshire Hathaway.

I figure, got a million left
from building the time machine,

so I'd take my half and
just stick it into Berkshire.

Then I'd come back here and...

I'm a billionaire.

Ohh.

Is there such a
thing as a trillionaire?

That's it. Money?

What else?

Nothing you'd change?

I'm rested.

Marion?
Are you still there?

Yes! It's a... It's
a little car. Beige.

I better call Saul!

Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.

Did you know that
you have rights?

The Constitution says
you do, and so do I.

I believe that,
until proven guilty,

every man, woman, and
child in this country is innocent.

And that's why I fight
for you, Albuquerque! Better Call...

Just call the main office.

you're gonna need a new manager.

Ah! Ah! Hey!

Ahh!

I need another phone call!

Another phone call!

William Oakley and Associates,

"Trust experience,
trust Oakley."

Bill Oakley speaking.

"Trust
experience, trust Oakley."

I like that. It's catchy.

You know who this is, right?

Saul?

You got it, buddy.

Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you,
uh... What... What are y...

Uh, wha... Uh,
what are you doing?

Uh, you know I'm gonna
have to report this call.

Whoa. Calm down, Junior.

The cops know
all about the call.

They're probably listening in.

The fact is, I'm
standing in the middle

of a police station as we speak.

So they finally caught you.

Listen. This is your lucky day.

I am talking to Saul Goodman's
new advisory counsel.

What?

Keep up, Bill.
You hit the jackpot.

"Advisory counsel...?"

This puts you on the map, amigo.

Here's what you're gonna do.

You're gonna grab a flight
to Omaha, Nebraska, ASAP.

There's nothing direct,

so you're gonna have to
connect through Houston.

Wh... Who's paying for this?

You are. Listen. You hear that?

Hear what? Bang, bang!

That's opportunity knocking.

Get off your ass
and answer the door.

Okay, on your
way to the airport...

Wait. Wait. Hold on... I
need you to make some calls.

Even supposing, hypothetically,

I'd be willing
to take this on...

"Willing"? Bill, this
is a career-maker.

Get real. You're doing this.

The DA has a warehouse
of evidence against you...

I can't even begin to imagine
what the Feds are sitting on.

No matter who your
lawyer is, you are screwed.

So I've gotta ask...

Where do you see this ending?

Where do I see it ending? Um...

With me on top. Like always.

RICO.

Not five, not ten,

but twenty-seven
predicate violations.

Federal conspiracy
to manufacture and distribute

a controlled substance.

On this scale? Life
sentence, stat max.

Money laundering.

Eight counts, twenty years each.

One hundred sixty
years, stat max.

We'll argue for
consecutive sentencing.

Accessory after
the fact to multiple murders.

Including two decorated
federal officers.

Fifteen years each.

By our count,
that's life plus...

One hundred ninety.

Life plus one
hundred ninety years.

All right. I'm willing to extend

a one-time,
take-it-or-leave-it offer.

Here's the
headline: thirty years.

Keep your nose
clean, stay healthy,

you have a shot at seeing
daylight in your old age.

Mr. Oakley, your "co-counsel,"

is he here with us?

Uh, listen, you've got Agent
Schrader's widow back there.

Why don't you invite
her in? Uh, wait a sec...

I mean, you owe her
that much, don't you?

Well, no, she... she
can't be present at a...

A plea negotiation. It's
completely inappropriate.

She's already here.

Both parties agree.
It's fine. Really.

They tell me they found
you in a garbage dumpster.

Well, that makes sense.

My husband was the best
man that I have ever known.

He lived to help others.

If somebody was in
trouble, no matter the time,

no matter the place, Hank
Schrader would be there.

With a smile and a joke.

He was kind,

he was decent,

he was strong.

His partner...

Steve Gomez.

Steve and Blanca

made a home that was
warm and full of laughter.

Three children.

Three fatherless children.

Hank and Steve... the good guys.

They were shot dead

and left in a
hole in the desert.

And you.

You helped the two-faced
poisonous bastard behind it all.

For what?

Money.

You did it all for money.

No matter what
they do with you now,

no matter where they
put you or for how long,

it will never be enough.

Mrs...

Mrs. Schrader.

The loss that you've suffered...

It's unspeakable.

I met your husband a few times.

He was a man who
stood by his word

and was very good at his job.

A straight shooter.

You and he are...

victims.

And so am I.

Two years ago a man
came into my office.

He said his name was Mayhew.

He wanted one of my
clients to lie under oath.

He offered me money.

I declined.

Any lawyer would.

That night, as I was leaving
my office, I was attacked.

Two men threw a
sack over my head,

they hogtied me, and they
drove me out into the desert.

And when they
pulled the hood off,

I was kneeling in
front of an open grave.

With a gun pointed at my head.

That was myintroduction
to Walter White.

From that moment on,

there hasn't been a
minute that I wasn't afraid.

Yeah. I worked for him.
I made a lot of money.

But that's not why I did it.

I did it because I knew what
he would do to me if I refused.

Over and over, I thought
about going to the police.

I even thought about
talking to Agent Schrader.

But I knew that Walter White
would kill me, wherever I was.

And I was right.

You look it up.

October 4, 2009.

They murdered ten
men inside three prisons

in the space of two minutes.

Knifed. Throats slashed.

A man was burned alive.

They even killed one of
my colleagues, a lawyer.

He was cooperating with the DEA.

Daniel Wachsburger.

The news said Dan
was stabbed 48 times.

So, yeah, when it
all blew up, I ran.

But not from the police.

From them.

Walter White might be dead,

but Jesse Pinkman
and the others?

They're still out
there, somewhere.

Mrs. Schrader...

you are looking at a man
who has lost everything.

My profession. My
family. My freedom.

I have... I have nobody.

I have nothing.

And you think jurors
are gonna buy that?

One.

All I need is one.

Oakley tells me that
you've never lost a case.

Is that so?

That's a hell of a record.

You should be proud of that.

Still...

Juries, right?

Whew. You never can tell.

It's a roll of the dice.

I'm just... I'm hoping
there's some wiggle room.

You are not going to
negotiate with this man.

You're not.

Seventeen.

After sentence has been
imposed on the counts

to which defendant pleads
guilty as agreed herein,

the government
will move to dismiss

Counts Three through
Nine of the indictment.

Eighteen.

Based on the facts now
known to the government,

the anticipated
offense level is 35,

which, when combined with

the anticipated criminal
history category of I,

results in an anticipated

advisory sentencing
guidelines range

of 85 to 90 months imprisonment,

in addition to any
supervised release,

fine, and restitution
the Court may impose.

Seven and a half years.

Let's get this thing
signed and get the hell out of here.

We're good with that.

"Nineteen.

Term to be served at FCI
Butner Low, North Carolina.

Wing D."

FCI Butner Low.

It's a great location.
Very nice weather.

It's the only federal
institution with a golf program.

It was good enough
for Bernie Madoff...

This is an actual request?

Are you kidding?

I give you guys half a chance,

you're gonna throw me into
gen pop in some hellhole.

I visited a client once
at ADX Montrose.

"The Alcatraz of the Rockies."

No. No, that's a
dealbreaker, my friend.

FCI Butner Low. Wing...

D. Wing D.

"Wing D."

And now we are done.

Ah, as Steve Jobs used
to say... one more thing.

"Twenty.

During incarceration,
Defendant Goodman to receive

one pint Blue Bell mint
chocolate chip ice cream

every Friday for the duration."

Are you kidding?

He's kidding.

"Blue Bell Mint Chocolate Chip."

No substitutions.

Okay. That's it.

Hold on. I can oil
everybody's locks.

It's nothing I've talked about.

New arena. Primo stuff.

Go.

Inside story, previously
unknown felony homicide.

It concerns a prominent
Albuquerque attorney

who, uh, disappeared,
believed to have killed himself.

Howard Hamlin?

You're talking
about Howard Hamlin.

That's your "sweetener"?

He's trying to sell
us the Hamlin thing.

He thought he
really had something.

Sounds like you and your ex

aren't talking on
a regular basis.

Kim Wexler walked into

the Albuquerque
DA's office last month.

She spilled her guts about
Howard Hamlin... on the record.

You got nothing left to sell.

Last chance.

Do we go to trial, or
do we have a deal?

Yes! Yes, we have a deal.

Let's get this in
writing. Not a word changes.

Ugh. Of course.

Am I gonna be sorry
if I ask what's going on?

I'm putting a stop to it.

A stop to what?

To what?

Listen. Just... No. Just listen.

That click?

The click.

The flame is lighting

and then it keeps going out.

So it's either a
thermocouple that's corroded

or we have a short.

A thermocouple is
corroded. Okay. I got it.

Hey, uh, maybe we
could just unplug it?

Or cut a wire or
something? No. Listen.

I see no reason to stay
down here without hot water...

when it's something
that I can easily fix.

Aha!

I think this will do the trick.

You wouldn't happen to have
a pocket knife or a screwdriver

in one of those bags, would you?

No.

What? Speak up!

No.

Come on!

There we go.

Yeah.

This should work.

Hey, you're a scientist, right?

So, uh, I have a question.

What would you do if
you had a time machine?

A time machine?

Yeah, um...

From a scientist's
point of view.

You can go backwards, forwards.

Uh, where would you go?

A meaningless question.

Time...

A time machine.

Look, time travel,

the kind of time travel
that you're thinking of,

is a scientific impossibility.

It would violate the Second
Law of Thermodynamics.

Uh, but what about
a wormhole? Ohh!

Well, I was watching "NOVA,"
and Alan Alda seemed to think...

Oh, well, then Alan
Alda... he's the expert.

Oh, Christ. Are you kidding me?

Quantum mechanics?
We're discussing that now?

Stay in your lane.

It's just a thought experiment.

There's gotta be something
you'd go back and change

if you could.

Oh, you are not talking
about a time machine,

which is both a real and
theoretical impossibility.

You are talking about regrets.

So if you want to
ask about regrets,

just ask about regrets
and leave all this

time-traveling
nonsense out of it.

Okay. Regrets, then.

Regrets.

Yeah.

My regrets. All right, well...

My regrets...

Well...

When I was a graduate student,

I started a company with some...

At the time, I thought
they were my friends.

Our goal was to commercialize
discoveries that I had made.

And...

at a certain point...

I stepped away.

I thought I was doing
the gentlemanly thing.

But little did I understand

that they were artfully
maneuvering me

into leaving my own creation.

And had I stayed, oh...

Well...

I wouldn't be
down here with you.

So you started a
company. Is it still around?

Oh, yes.

Is it successful?

Very.

How could you never
tell me about this?

We could have done
something with this.

Wrongful termination,
intellectual property theft,

uh, patent fraud.

I mean, I coulda
sunk my teeth into this!

You'd have been the last
lawyer I'd have gone to.

Yeah. Sure.

So, what about you?

Regrets?

Y... Wait. I got one.

You know what? Never mind.

When I
was twenty... um, twenty-two,

I pulled a slip and fall
outside Marshall Field's.

Uh... I did.

And I was stupid and young
and I was trying to show off.

So I hit the ice
as fast as I could.

I biffed it so hard,
I heard a crack!

Whew. Wasn't
the ice... it was me.

I actually hurt myself.

I mean, I... My knee
has never been the same.

"A slip and fall"?

Yeah. That's how I put myself
through bartending school.

Right.

So...

So you were always like this.

Sorry.

Ssst! Bill! Hey.

I'm just going to...

Sir, this man is a federal
prisoner. I'm a U.S. Marshal.

I ask you not to speak to him.

That's my lawyer.

Is that true? You're his lawyer?

Yes.

You'll have other opportunities
to talk to your client.

Please move out of the
aisle. - No, hold on.

N-Nothing I say in front
of you is privileged, right?

That's right.

So if I talk to my attorney
and we let something slip

that could help the
government's case,

you could pass it
along to the prosecution.

Totally clean.

Correct.

With that in mind, you're sure
we can't have a few words?

Make it fast.

She confessed. What's
the DA gonna do with it?

No witnesses, no
physical evidence...

If I had to guess...

Most likely they sit
on it. Permanently.

Okay.

No, not "okay."

Not for her. Her
problem's not the DA.

What then?

Well, apparently, Kim took her
sworn and notarized statement

and hand delivered
it to Hamlin's widow.

No.Yes.

She opened herself
up to a civil suit.

The widow can take
her for everything she has

and everything she's
gonna have, in perpetuity.

So, is she? Suing?

Look, all I can
tell you for sure

is that Mrs. Hamlin's out
lawyer shopping as we speak.

Not that she
bothered to call me.

Hey, can I, uh, go
to the john now?

I'm going.

Hold up, Bill.

No, wait. You're
gonna love this.

The Hamlin thing? The government
doesn't know the half of it.

As soon as we land, I
want you to tell the other side

that I've got more
to trade, okay?

I j-just remembered something
that'll make their toes curl.

Okay.

Anything that makes their "toes
curl" is bound to jam Kim up.

If it involves her.

Oh, it involves her.

Kim's already got a civil
suit hanging over her head.

You give the government more,

maybe they bring
the hammer down.

What more are you gonna get?

What's left?

You don't understand.

It's really good ice cream.

Boys again? Girls this time.

Well, she's not sleeping
for a year or two.

At least. Is she coming back?

She'll have to.

Josh is a twin, isn't he?

Oh, yeah. And it's
his birthday next week.

I always take him
out, just the two of us,

because, you know, he
had to share everything.

Well, that's nice. It's
either Red Lobster

or that new Middle
Eastern place...

The one over on Wickham.

Top something? Topkapi.

That's it. Topkapi.

Glen took you there, didn't
he? What'd you guys think?

Uh, it wasn't...

Not good, huh?

No, uh. No. It was fine.

Would Josh like it?

He... He might.

Okay. Another
birthday at Red Lobster.

He can live with that.

What did we get them
for the shower? A stroller, right?

Yeah, one of the nice ones
with the shock absorbers.

With twins? They might
need a double stroller...

You, too, Donny.

Seana, Donny from
TPC Sawgrass, line four.

Hey, Tammy. I'm leaving early.

Can you let Ricardo know?

Sure. No prob.

Thanks.

If he shows up, you
keep that door locked.

You call the police,
and then you call me.

Any time, day or night. Okay?

Okay. I'll see you Thursday.

Let me know if you
need me to pick you up.

All right. Thank you.Okay.

Ladies, it's right this way.

Sorry about the
heat. AC's on the fritz.

Fill this out. And, before
you ask, there's no charge.

All our services are free.

Oh, a-actually, I'm here
to see if I can volunteer.

You want to volunteer?

Yes.

Can you answer a phone?

Sure.

Then there you go.

Central Florida Legal

Hello?

Kim? Yes.

This is Suzanne Ericsen.

Hi, Suzanne.

I want to make it clear this
call is completely unofficial.

All right.

I shouldn't even
be talking to you.

But considering everything,
I think it's only right

you know what's going on.

You've seen the news?

I don't think so.

Your ex, "Saul Goodman"?

He was arrested in Nebraska.

He's been extradited
to New Mexico.

When was this?

Two days ago.

But that's not why I'm calling.

He's giving testimony
that affects you, personally.

What kind of testimony?

It's showtime.

Courtroom
deputy: All rise

for the right honorable
Judge Samantha Small.

Court's now in session.
Please take a seat.

Okay, item one on the calendar,

CR 10-7253 United
States of America versus...

Defendant has requested to
use the name Saul Goodman.

So it's "United States
versus Saul Goodman."

Counsel, please state
your appearances.

AUSA George Castellano.

With me is Elizabeth
Nooryani, Trial Attorney from the

Drug Enforcement Section
of the Department of Justice;

AUSAs Sarah Braddock,
Neel Patel, and Hillary Park

and Special Agent in Charge
Austin Ramey from the D.E.A.

Also present in the courtroom:

Zachary Hernandez,
Special Agent in Charge

of the FBI in New Mexico.

Your Honor, I'd also like to
note the presence of the victims

who are here this morning...

Marie Schrader and Blanca Gomez.

William Oakley appearing
as advisory counsel.

Saul Goodman appearing
on his own behalf.

Good morning.

The defendant still wants
to represent himself?

Uh... That's right, your Honor.

Okay.

The parties have
reached a plea agreement

satisfactory to both sides.

However, I have
reviewed the government's

sentencing
recommendations and...

well, I have questions.

Mr. Castellano, will you please
come up to the microphone?

Mr. Castellano, today
we consider the sentence

for a defendant who
will be pleading guilty

to multiple felonies,
RICO offenses,

money laundering, conspiracy,

accessory after the fact to
the murder of federal officers.

And for these offenses,

the government's sentencing
recommendation is seven years.

Your Honor, I can
assure you my colleagues and I gave

every aspect of
this recommendation

careful consideration.

Help me understand.

Has the defendant provided

substantial assistance
to the government?

Your Honor?

Mr. Oakley, please
advise your client

to stay silent at this time.

Your Honor, with respect,
Mr. Oakley is advisory counsel.

I'm representing
myself here today.

If I may say something
that I think will help the court

fully understand the situation?

Mr. Goodman, you
are the beneficiary

of the most generous
sentencing recommendation

I've seen in 22
years on the bench.

Any statement you make
imperils that recommendation.

I'm very aware of
that, Your Honor.

Uh, if you'll allow me to speak,

I... I think I can save
the court's valuable time.

Go ahead. Briefly.

Two years ago a man
came into my office.

He said his name was Mayhew.

He wanted one of my clients
to lie for him under oath.

He offered me money.

I refused.

That night, as I was leaving
my office, I was attacked.

A bag was shoved over
my head, I was hogtied,

I was driven out
into the desert.

And when they
pulled the hood off,

I was kneeling in
front of an open grave

with a gun pointed at my head.

That was my introduction
to Walter White!

I was terrified.

But not for long.

That night, I saw opportunity.

A shot at big money.

And I grabbed it
and I held it tight.

And for the next sixteen
months, my every waking moment

was spent building
Walter White's drug empire.

Hold on, Mr. Goodman.
Stop right there.

Consult Mr. Oakley before
you say another word.

Your Honor, I believe the
court deserves the whole truth.

You are contradicting
your plea agreement's

sworn factual basis.

No offense, Your Honor, but I...

I think I know the law
here better than you do.

Your Honor, we'd like
to request a recess.

No, we do not need a recess.

Your Honor, we are satisfied
for Mr. Goodman to continue.

Your Honor, I'd like to petition
to withdraw from this case.

Denied. Respectfully...

Not a chance.

Bobbi, swear Mr. Goodman in.

Do you swear that the evidence

you shall give to the
court in this matter

shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth

so help you God?

I do.

Mr. Goodman, you
are now under oath.

Any false statement you
make can be used in prosecution

for perjury or
obstruction of justice.

Do you understand?

Yes.

All right.

In the last 24 hours,

have you used any
alcohol or other drugs?

No, Your Honor.

Are you taking any
prescription medications?

No.

All right.

Continue.

Oh, um, I lied to the government
about, uh, Kim Wexler.

Uh, I fed them a load of B.S.

about her involvement in
Howard Hamlin's murder.

I just... I just wanted
her to come here today.

I wanted her to hear this.

So, yeah, I wasn't there
when the meth was cooked.

I wasn't there when it was sold.

I didn't witness
any of the murders.

But I damn well knew
it was happening.

I was more than a
willing participant.

I was indispensable.

I kept Walter White out of
jail, I laundered his money,

I lied for him, I
conspired with him,

and I made millions.

If he hadn't walked
into my office that day,

Walter White would
have been dead

or behind bars within a month.

And Agent Schrader
and Agent Gomez

and a whole lot of other
people would still be alive.

The fact is,

Walter White
couldn't have done it

without me.

You got that?

Your Honor, we move to
strike Mr. Goodman's comments.

On what grounds?

Speculation. Speculation?

He's testifying to
his own actions.

Your Honor, uh,
he's describing events

that wouldhave transpired
had he acted differently.

I have one more thing to say.

- Sit down, Mr. Goodman. Now.
- Please, your Honor. Please.

The government urges the court

to allow Mr. Goodman
to continue.

How is that not speculation?

All right, Mr. Goodman.

Go ahead.

What happened
to Howard Hamlin...

it was...

it was...

I can't even...

After that,

Kim had the guts to start over.

She left town, but...

I'm the one who ran away.

And my brother Chuck...

Uh, Charles McGill.

Y-You may have known him.

He was an
incredible lawyer, as...

The most brilliant
guy I ever met.

But he was limited.

I tried.

I could have tried harder.

I should have.

Instead, when... Your Honor.

Bill, please. Just let
me get through this.

Instead, when I saw a
chance to hurt him, I took it.

I got his malpractice
insurance canceled.

I took away the one
thing he lived for...

The law.

After that, he killed himself.

And I'll live with that.

What was all that?

That thing with your brother,
that wasn't even a crime.

Yeah, it was.

Mr. Goodman, sit
down and stay seated.

The name's McGill.

I'm James McGill.

Your Honor, in view
of the defendant's confession...

Your Honor, we'd
like to request a recess...

the Government withdraws its
sentencing recommendation... Now, hold on.

That was not a confession.
That was... and urges this court

to impose the statutory maximum
for each of these offenses.

That was not a confession. It was
merely, uh, a single point of view...

Furthermore, your Honor,
a second additional hearing

is required... in a very
complex, uh, narrative...

in order to assess the
additional claims Mr. Goodman...

I'm sorry... Mr. McGill
has now admitted to...

including perjury on
this court, your Honor.

Did you ground yourself?

Yes, I did!

Oh, crap!

I was starting to worry.

My car conked out on I-40.

I almost got creamed
by a cement truck.

Oh, um, they had those
apples that you like.

I got you half a dozen Fuji.

Um, and the newsstand on Central

said they might start
carrying the Financial Times.

So that's good, right?

What?

You know, I could
hire someone to do this.

I could get someone
from the office.

I'm doing it.

Yeah, every day?

While you're trying
to start a... practice?

Why?

Why?

'Cause you're my brother.

Duh. You'd do the same for me.

Mm. Well, you
could stay for a while.

We could talk.

Talk? What about?

Well, your cases. Your clients.

Youwant to talk about myclients?

Seriously?
You want to talk about, uh,

the granny who got
picked up for soliciting

inside the Christian
Science Reading Room?

Wh... What about the kid
who broke into a liquor store

and drank five bottles
of crème de menthe

and then passed out
behind the counter?

They deserve a vigorous defense.

Like any other client.

Or maybe you just wanna
tell me what I'm doing wrong.

That's not what I had in mind.

I'm hoping you didn't steal
that from a motel ice machine.

You can hope.

I'm gonna take a pass on
the heart-to-heart, Chuck.

One of my "deserving" clients...

He got caught waving the
weenie outside a Hobby Lobby.

Hold on. You got to
reimburse yourself.

Mnh. This one's on me.

Jimmy...

If you don't like
where you're heading,

there's no shame in going
back and changing your path.

Ohh. When have you
ever "changed your path"?

Hey. Think on it.

We always end up having the
same conversation, don't we?

I'll see ya tomorrow, Chuck.

And I might have
the Financial Times.

I know you?

Hey.

"Better Call Saul."

Right?

McGill.

Wha'?

I'm McGill.

Don't give me that.

You're Saul!

It's Better Call Saul.

No shit. Deep
voice: Psst! Psst!

Back here, yo.

Back here.

See? Toldja!

It's Better Call Saul!

You're right. Better Call Saul.

Yeah. Better Call Saul.

Better...

Call...

Saul.

Better...

Call...

Saul.

Better Call Saul!

Better Call Saul!

Better Call Saul!

All of you, shut
up! Better Call Saul!

Better Call Saul! I said shut up!

Better Call
Saul! Shut the hell up!

Better Call
Saul! Shut the hell up!

Better Call Saul!

Better Call...

Saul! Lawyer's here!

I got ya, Saul.

Ma'am? No cuffs, please.

Thank you.

Hi, Jimmy.

Hi.

How did you...?

Uh, turns out my
New Mexico bar card

doesn't have an expiration date.

You had them
down to seven years.

Yeah, I did.

Eighty-six years.

Eighty-six years.

But with good behavior...

who knows?

Here we go, here we go.

I'm Bob Odenkirk,
and I wanted to say hi.

I want to say thank you to
the fans of "Better Call Saul."

How do I even begin
to thank the fans?

Hmm. I'll try not to cry.

We are nothing without the fans.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I'm not finding
the words I'd like,

so let's pause it for a
second, just one second.

I got to play
Howard Hamlin for six years,

and the only reason I
got to do it for six years

is because of the fans.

You guys have truly
been Kim Wexler's confidante

in many, many, many
scenes, her closest confidante.

And I appreciate it so much.

The fans have shown
an appreciation that gave me

a greater appreciation
for the stories

and reminded me
how fortunate I am

to have been a part of it.

Took us a long time
to get this thing done.

We really enjoyed it, and I hope
you guys enjoy it just as much.

This show has
you on the edge of your seat,

and you fans are responsible
for keeping us here

and having us make
really wonderful, powerful,

profound entertainment,
so thank you.

From the bottom of my
heart, thank you so much.

Hey, "Better Call Saul" fans.

Hey, it's Vince. And Peter.

I'm sad that this era
has come to an end.

That's a wrap.

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

I gotta thank
everybody who's watched the show.

What a wonderful,
wonderful time of my life.

And hope we've made you happy.

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

- Thanks.
- Thank you.

Thank you so much.
