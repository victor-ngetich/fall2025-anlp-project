Jesus Christ.

Mara!

Vic!

- Vic!
- Shut up!

- Vic, listen, man.
- Shut up.

You don't understand.

Corrine and my kids?

Vic, you don't understand.
Vic, I saved their lives.

The Armenians know
about the money train!

What do they know?

You cozied up to Diro,
got her spooked.




She started
to turn over rocks.

She made you
for the money-train grab.

There's only four people
who knew we did that robbery...

...and three of them
are in this room.

The other one,
you blew to pieces.

You told her it was us and
left yourself out.

You think I'm an idiot?

Eventually that Armenian bitch
and her mob buddies...

...will figure out that
I was involved.

Yeah, and me too, asshole.

Diro greenlit your family.

When I heard about the hit,
I went back to Rezian...

...and I made a deal
to shut down Diro.

Now Rezian thinks that the both
of you are behind it, too.




Oh, Jesus Christ.

I'm paying off your debt in favors
to keep you and your family safe.

You're paying off
my money-train debt?

What the hell
have you gotten us into?

I'm on an Island here for you.

For you and your family.

Rezian told me who Diro hired
for the hit.

That was the blood
in your house.

I put a bullet
in the asshole.

What's the asshole's name?

Zadofian.

He's Armenian muscle.

I capped him
and he ran off.

You let the guy who was hired
to kill my family get away?

I stopped him from killing
Corrine and your kids.

And he's still out there?

Look, Vic, if we just can work
together on this thing.

We don't work together
on shit anymore.

I'm gonna find Zadofian...

...and I'll find out
the truth, too.

Until then,
you stay out of my way.

Yeah, I get it.
I know you hate me.

Hey! Hey!

But you got to understand, man.

I would never do anything
to hurt your family.

Lem was family.

- What the hell was that?
- Are you OK?

- Are you okay?
- What the hell was that?

Just hold on.
Hey, buddy. Everything's fine.

- Look, I'm sorry.
- A washcloth in my mouth?

Vic would never do anything
to hurt us.

He tied me up,
and he beat the shit out of you.

What is that,
the good-neighbor policy?

Look, I got word
that the Armenians...

...were coming after Vic for
the money-train robbery.

I scooped up Corrine and Cassidy
to keep them safe.

I didn't have a chance
to call him and fill him in.

You protect his family, and he
pays you back by terrorizing us?

It was just him thinking...

...I was taking our bad blood
to the next level.

That bad blood is spraying
all over this family.

Look, I keep trying to do
the right thing.

Vic is never gonna forgive you
for Lem.

You got to get away
from him.

It's the only way
you're gonna get right.

So what happens
with your hearing now?

Walking out
didn't weigh in my favor.

S.I.S. offered me a spot.
I think I'm gonna take it.

I'm not staying in Farmington
with Shane.

- Thanks for coming out so late.
- I appreciate the gig.

Security work's
been pretty lean lately.

You'd think five years on the force
would qualify you for more stuff.

I'm not sure how you want to
handle the payment.

Yeah.

This will handle
the first week.

I ruffled some Armenian feathers.
Looks like they might want to strike back.

I need you to look after
Corrine and my family.

I'll be like a mother bird
with her eggs.

The guy's name is Zadofian.

I'll e-mail you his interpol photo
when get back to the barn.

My family's staying
at my place.

They can't know that they're being watched.
They don't know anything about the threat.

I don't want them scared.

Not a problem.

You got a gun?

Good.

No chances.

You had me arrested.
You make the case go away.

I already took a big-ass risk
losing those ledgers.

When I start altering reports,
I will be in a jail cell right next to you.

Now,
That does not help you.

As long as I'm locked up in here...

...and Diro is out there,
everything is at risk.

Diro's probably back in Munich
playing quarters with co-eds by now.

Diro Kesakian has been working for...

...her father's illegal businesses
since she was 15...

...and she's not
going to stop now.

I need to find her.

I'm not your Armenian lojack.
I don't know where she is.

Zadofian,
that hit man that you shot...

...he'll know
where Diro's hiding.

Find him.

Turn him over to my men.

They will extract the truth,
and I'll get Diro.

And where do Armenian hit men
nurse belly wounds these days?

He's dick-sweet on this little
filipina whore.

Street name's Darla.

Find Zadofian in one piece
before your police friends do.

How'd your hearing go
last night?

You haven't heard?

I'll let it be
a surprise.

I'm tired of blood.

Ronnie, you're taking lead
on anything gang-related.

Vic, until your status is determined,
can't have you headlining anything.

Captain, car dragged two bodies...

...all the way down Kearney Street
around the corner.

Victims were Salvadoran.
Castillo's crew.

Salvadoran and Mexicans
both run a piece of this block.

Until now, they've always
shared lunch money.

Call in Vendrell. The whole team figures out
who broke the truce and why.

Can I help you?

Agent Olivia Murray,
I.C.E.

You folks usually
lob the obligatory...

...courtesy call before you
muscle in on a case.

I'm not a muscling
kind of gal.

Here unofficially.
Curiosity call.

What's your unofficial
curiosity?

Captain Wyms.
Special team member detective Vic Mackey.

I share, you share?

Dragging bodies to designate
new boundaries in blood...

...is right out of the
"manada de muerte" handbook.

Death mob?

Cartel mercenaries.
Ex-Mexican military and federales.

Make 10 times as much
protecting the cartels...

...than they do citizens.

What in God's name
are they doing in Farmington?

That's the curious part.

Since those San Marcos house murders,
this place has been a hot zone.

Tell me about it.

All that blood,
all those hacked-up body parts...

...and I.C.E. couldn't flesh out
a single player or an illegal operation.

Our bureau Chief shut down
my investigation.

You're freelancing.

Trying to kick-start your case.

If I can tie the cartel
to a local player...

...Olivia's back in the hood.

We could use the jackets
of those Mexican cops...

...who've fallen from Gracia.

I'll make it happen.

Okay.

Barn's at your disposal.

Oh. Next time,
take the bus, boys.

Some banger over in county was
threatening to off a cop's family.

Cass, go check on your
brother and sister.

I'm old enough
to hear this.

It's okay.

It's all right.

Now, the guard thought the
prisoner was talking about me.

He tipped off Shane.

When Shane couldn't get
in touch with me, he panicked...

...put you guys away
for your own safety.

What about the blood
in our house?

I just talked
to Wyms about that.

Looks like it was a break-in
gone sideways.

They get nervous,
they hear someone coming...

...and they accidentally cap
one of their own guys.

I'm supposed to believe
all this happened...

...at the same time shane locks us
in a box for our own well-being?

Shane overreacted.

His heart was
in the right place...

...but unfortunately, his brain
was a couple of steps behind.

And we were never
in any danger?

There's nothing
to be afraid of.

We're not
in any danger now?

No.

I promise.

Listen, this whole thing
really rattled my cage.

I'd really, really love it
if you'd hang around here.

I mean, I'd just feel better if you were
under my roof for a couple of days.

Close to me, okay?

Vic!

Saw him behind your neighbor's
shrubs watching your door.

I need those files.

This Zadofian?

Actually, it's not.

Who the hell is it?

Don't ask.

Hey, screw.
Screw.

Don't you move.

See you, sweetie.
See you later.

Pezuela send you after me?

Might as well kill me.

If I don't return
La Caja de Pecado, I'm dead.

The box of sins?

That's clever.

All those files.

All those blackmail files
I took from your trunk.

I spent two and half years, hundreds of
thousands of dollars gathering that intel.

That's political payback for L.A.'s
most upstanding and influential citizens.

You sound a little bitter.

I watched those hypocrites
do everything...

...from fixing parking tickets
to ordering murders.

I'm the one who gave
Pezuela his leverage.

Made him indispensable
to the cartel.

And he's gonna pay you back by
putting a bullet in your head.

That sucks.

The cartel doesn't know
you lost their blackmail files.

Pezuela either.

No.

Who sent the death squad
up here?

Mexican drug lords are getting nervous
about their investment in Los Angeles...

...especially the Salvadoran
resistance.

They sent up manada de muerte
six days ago to help.

Why'd they draw the blood lines
down Kearney Street?

Pezuela is expanding
his development.

It's where he wants
his new hotel.

Wait!

You're just gonna leave me
chained here?

Trust me, I could do worse.

Got a call from county
this morning...

...wanting to know if they should
issue a monthly guest pass.

Seems like you've been making
regular visits to Ellis Rezian.

The Armenians had a front-row seat
to this whole Mexican-Salvadoran beef.

He's facing a charge.

I'm just trying to convince him...

...it's in his best interest
to share the knowledge.

Vice had a C.I. Who got
patched up by an Armenian doc.

If Zadofian's looking to get sewn up
outside the system...

...this is where he'd probably go.

"Dr. Edna lucine.
Bow-wow and meow. "

What, she's a vet?

Hate to be part
of that H.M.O.

I'm gonna go check
on our doggy doc...

...make sure Zadofian
got neutered.

Dutch.

Could you fill my box?

Anything to help.

Packed tight.

How come you got the unis
doing admin?

What would you prefer
they be doing?

Had three people quit. Downtown's
hit us with a hiring freeze.

Why?
We're already understaffed.

Billings' lawsuit.

You're kidding me!
The guy tapped his head on a desk.

City attorney's gonna settle
with him today.

They want him done and gone.
That means you'll be flying solo.

The operative word being "fly. "
Billings was a weight around my neck.

I'm glad to see your partner's absence
hasn't dampened your humility.

Dr. Lucine, I presume.

Uh, I'm in the middle
of an exam.

You're in the middle
of a whole lot more than that.

I understand you're a Chief
surgeon at Armenia general.

I'm a veterinarian.

So I check your pharmaceutical logs,
all I'm gonna find are doggy meds?

I borrowed money from Armenian
loan sharks to pay for school.

I didn't know patching up criminals
was gonna be part of my monthly payments.

Did an Armenian come in here
with a belly wound?

The bullet missed vital organs,
but he lost a lot of blood.

Where is he now?

I stabilized him. I drove him to the
edgemont hotel. Second floor.

That's right.

That's right.
You're doing good.

I was gonna say "pussy gram,"
but that seemed a little obvious.

What the hell is this?

I'll have her back before
that little blue pill wears off.

Come on let's go.

What the hell do you want?

I'm looking for Zadofian.

Don't go blonde on me.
Rezian told me you're his main cooch.

I haven't seen him.

You want me to tell Rezian
you were uncooperative?

Now, where does he stay
when he's in town?

The Edgemont Hotel.

Hey, Dutch.

Do you have a minute?

Um, let me go first.

What happened last night...

...we were both vulnerable,
a little lonely.

One-time thing
between good friends.

No reason for us
to get all uncomfortable.

There's a guy here,
says he killed his wife.

Oh.

Uh, okay.

Well, I better,
I better get on that.

Wouldn't want him to kill
anybody else's wife.

Yeah.

So, you killed your wife
two years ago.

A little over
two years now.

And no, I had
my friend Hector kill her.

I ground up some sleeping pills,
put it in her wine.

She took a bath.
I went to work.

Hector was supposed to push her
down in the tub...

...make it look like she got wasted
and drowned.

Douche bag
showed up too soon.

She was awake.

Had to force her head
underwater.

That's how you guys
knew it was murder.

You were tried
and acquitted for the crime.

And you can't arrest me now
cause I'm protected by final jeopardy.

Right.

Um, why not give up Hector
at trial?

D.A. had a shit case.
I knew I'd get off.

If I gave up Hector then, he
would've told them I planned it.

What was in it for Hector?

I fronted him the money to start
a vinyl siding business.

So you and your buddy
killed your wife.

You got no remorse
about that?

You had to know her.

I just want Hector
behind bars now.

Why the sudden interest
in justice?

I never thought I'd want to get
married again, you know?

Understandable.

And then, bam.
I meet Lorena.

Fall head over heels, man.

Let me guess.

Lorena's with Hector.

She works
at his siding company.

I know she loves me,
but she's afraid to leave him.

Him being a murder
and all.

Exactly.

Zadofian?

Room 11.

Listen, I don't know
how this is gonna go.

You can take a pass.

If Shane's telling the truth, this
guy's a threat to all of us. I'm in.

Hey!

Don't move!

Who shot you?

Screw you.

Who?!

Had to be someone
working for Rezian.

Is that the guy?

Yeah, that's him.
Who is he?

You went after my family.

God damn it.

Vic.

Come on, Vic.
Vic.

Think about it, Vic.
Think about it.

He was in Corrine's house.

His blood is on her floor.

This is too messy.

I'm just a soldier.

Don't know who or why.

We need to know
where to find Diro.

Page her.

Claudette, Emilio knows he can't
be retried for the murder...

...gave me all the details about
how Hector killed his wife.

See what Hector
has to say.

Actually, the original detective
on the case already did that.

Ruled him out
as a suspect.

Detective Steve Billings.

See if he has
the strength to talk.

Hey, Vic!

Julien's got a witness
for the body-dragging in one.

Where's Gardocki?

He's running down
a Salvadoran lead.

Should be back soon.

Whatever information
you give up could save lives.

What, I look like
wonder woman to you?

I'm wearing some sort
of magic bracelet...

...that's gonna deflect bullets...

...when people find out that
I'm talking to you assholes?

Here's another one now.

Byz Lat queen.

Who's the lucky cholo?

Jimmy Mendez.

Forget it.

She'll never talk.

She can't.

The way the street's
been jumping off lately...

...they even find out she was down here,
it'll be Jimmy they're dragging around.

Just because I got into a cop car
don't mean that I'm giving anything up.

I hope you can convince
them of that.

Sorry to trouble you.

Give her a minute.

Anybody ever tumble
over this thing?

Not without
a friendly push.

Hey, choirboy,
that's for me.

I'll take the stairs.

Vic.

If I like remember something...

...can you make sure nothing
happens to Jimmy?

I ain't doing
this baby shit by myself.

God damn it.

No. No, my Salvadoran lead
didn't pan out.

Vic back yet?

Yeah, he and Julien are going at
a witness to the body-dragging.

OK. I got one more
lead to run down.

I'll check back in.

That's Diro returning my call.

That Diro's number?

Yeah, that's her.

Shouldn't I answer it?

No.

No, that's not necessary.

Ah! Shit.

Oh, shit.

Oh. Oh, shit.

Files on all
the Mexican federales...

...kicked off the force
in the last five years.

Cartel must have one hell
of a pension plan.

What's this?

Death mob candidates.

Ex-federales.

Bounce it off our witness.

Maybe she can pick out
who's painting the streets.

Captain, we got shots fired
at the edgemont hotel.

Shit. That must be retaliation
for the draggings.

Stay with Julien.

Vendrell's in transit.

I'll have him check it out.

Okay.

Somewhere on the second floor.

Holy Christ.

Clear.

1- tango-72,
we got a 187 at this location.

Please advise.

Hey.

Holy shit, you got here fast.

Johnny on the spot.

Ouch.

Footloose and fancy-free.

Those Armenians sure do know how
to send a message, don't they?

No shit.

You okay?

Shane was telling the truth
about Zadofian...

...going after your family.

Are you okay?

Talked to Claudette, pulled the trigger
less than a minute later.

We're both covered.

Hey, man. I need to see that
distant stare come off your face.

I'm okay.

Good.

You get Diro's number?

Yeah. Time comes,
I can GPS it in a heartbeat.

Good. We'll shut down Rezian first.

As far as anyone knows, you were
following up on the Salvadorans.

Vic, our witnessed I.D.'d
one of the federales.

Our lucky day.

We'll be right in.

I got to go check on the great brown
hope about keeping my badge.

Hey.

You firing on enough cylinders
to handle this death mob thing?

Yeah, I'm good.

Hey. Those other
Salvadoran leads pan out?

No. They were dead ends.

What's with the cab?

You know, ever since the injury,
I have these blackouts.

Makes driving too risky.

I'm gonna need you
to reimburse me for this.

Wyms said there's some insurance
papers I need to sign.

Yeah. Thanks for coming down.

It's against my better judgment.

I'm supposed to avoid
the stress.

While you're signing the paperwork
there's some information I need...

...about a case you shared with the Barn
when you were at central.

I'll try to help, but I've got these huge
memory gaps ever since the injury.

Yeah. How is the bump on the head?

The brain is the most mercurial
organ in the human body.

Yes, it is.

You remember the Doris Borrego
homicide?

That was a while back.

What about it?

The husband who was acquitted
came into the Barn today, confessed...

...fingered his buddy
Hector Jimenez for the murder.

The D.A. tanked that case.

It was a slam dunk.

Insardi totally blew it.
You know...

...from what I can recall.

You remember
why you ruled out Hector?

Who?

I'm gonna need you
to check your notes...

...see if anything
jars your memory.

Maybe you should
call that cab back.

I'm getting
a little light-headed.

Okay. I'm just trying to help
my partner here.

But if the D.A. pulls you
back into this...

...it might delay the progress
on your lawsuit.

Right.

Might need to make
a sushi run.

Protein helps
with my memory capability.

I'll get right on that.

You and I have the only
two copies of the keys.

What are you doing?

There are over 100 blackmail
files in this box.

I only need one of them
to get my badge back.

You're gonna blackmail someone
just like Pezuela?

No, I'm gonna give them
their sin back...

...grant them absolution.

Him giving me my badge back is just
gonna be his way of showing gratitude.

Right now, this intel
is the only proof that...

...we have that Pezuela's dirty.

Using it as leverage
will compromise it as evidence.

Plus Pezuela will know
that you have the box.

We can't risk
exposing that now.

Now that your kodak moment
is out of this box...

...to hell with everyone else,
right?

You and me,we're never
gonna be friends.

We both know that we're
just here for survival.

You want to be mayor.

All I want to do is
keep being a cop.

We can't use this information
to get your job back.

But we can begin to use it
to hurt Pezuela.

Those body-dragging murders
you're investigating.

Pezuela sweeping away
the Salvadorans.

What of it?

So he can build
his new hotel.

There's a vote tomorrow night.
A major rezoning Bill.

Councilman dowd
is chairman of the committee.

Dowd's in the box.

Pezuela's twisting his arm
so the vote will go his way.

What if we made a copy
of the file...

...for our case against Pezuela
and send dowd the original...

...anonymously?

Untwist his arm.

Pezuela spent a lot of money.

He shed a lot of blood
for that hotel.

He's gonna be pissed.

Pull the file.

Any luck?

No, not yet.

But I seem to vaguely recall
that Hector had some kind of alibi.

Maybe if you took off
the sunglasses...

...you could actually see
something.

Doctor's orders.

Fluorescents exacerbate
my migraines.

Oh, here it is.

Lorena Francisco.

All night.

Great rack?

Well, this sounds
like your notes.

She said she was with Hector
the night of the murder...

...and I do recall
she had great tits.

Billings, can I see you
in my office?

I just got a call from
the city attorney's office...

...said your lawyer turned down
our settlement offer.

I'm not at liberty
to discuss the case.

That's what my bitch-dyke
lawyer is for.

It's bad enough criminals
sue us...

...but cops filing
bogus suits?

I was injured on the job,
and now I'm disabled.

Do you know where
that payoff money comes from?

Community programs, education,
gang intervention.

Well, you should have
thought about that...

...before you let Mackey and
Kavanaugh run out of control.

This is on you.

Get out.

Department must be
pretty desperate.

You begging me to settle.

Looks like I got the brass
by the balls...

...and now it's squeezing time.
- You're a goddamn joke.

I'll add slander
to my suit.

Captain, witness turned up a match
from our ex-federales list.

It's just in time.

You remember a case a couple
years back, Doris Borrego?

We shared it with central?

That's right.

Sure. It was my first dead body.
Bathtub.

Did you testify
at that trial?

Didn't do much good.

Defense ripped Billings'
police work to shreds.

Insardi chewed him out.

Half of downtown heard it.

Yeah, thanks.

According to Billings,
?nsardi was the one...

...that tanked the case.

Seems like it really got
under his skin.

Maybe Steve would be interested...

...in a chance to redeem himself.

I'm all about second chances.

On our body-draggings, witness
I.D.'d Marcus Villanueva.

Thrown off the policia federal
two years ago.

Him and his partner accidentally
slit the throat of a suspect...

...during an interrogation.

On-the-job training
for his next gig.

His brother owns an army
surplus store in Norman.

If he's there, he's probably
not alone or empty-handed.

Strike team leads it.

I'll see if downtown can shake
loose a SWAT unit.

I'll make sure that happens.

Set up strategic on the 101
on-ramp near 59th and Olive.

You ready for this?

Absolutely.

Place is closed. They got
six cars parked out back.

One of them's the pickup truck
our witness identified.

We should move while we got
them contained.

These psychos get off
on collateral damage.

It's your call.

SWAT's 15 minutes out. We'll wait.

Where's Vic?

He's trying to head off
the Salvadoran retaliation.

He's on his way.

Heard things didn't go so well
at your hearing.

That's unfortunate.

Must've been a full moon.

Bad night for everyone.

A cartel death squad
used a couple of salvas...

...to draw blood lines
down Kearney.

You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

It's awful.

Almost as awful as having
a former employee...

...sell off your private files.

What files are those?

Whatever they are,
they sure got the cesspool bubbling.

R.O.C., Salvadorans, niners.
They're all bidding.

The word is intel belonged to you.

What's your interest?

Same as yours.
Get back what I lost.

Your badge.

Squeezing Aceveda
was a waste of time.

He's a unique.

My point,
you need someone with balls.

I keep my badge, I got the
resources to be that guy.

Your dismissal
is already in motion.

What?

We got to move
on this death mob.

Lost SWAT to some hostage thing
in south central.

Really could use you
watching my back.

All right. I'll call in for the 20.

Not sure if I can help you,
detective.

Not sure
if I can help you either.

Let's keep talking.

We got movement at the shop.
One vehicle pulling out.

Pickup truck?

No. Gray jeep.

Get the plate number.

We got to do this
without SWAT.

They're moving out.

Let's go! Let's go!

Police! Let me see your hands!

Guns!

We're pinned down!
Under fire!

Call Wilshire for backup.

Got an officer down.

Three or four shooters.

Okay. Give me a radio.

Ronnie,
I'm gonna create a diversion.

You. Show me your hands.

Don't move.

I thought you were gonna create
a diversion.

What, that's not
big enough for you?

Everybody whole?

More or less.

Any idea how I should explain
this one to Phillips?

He knows I've always had trouble
following directions.

Just tell him
I took a wrong turn.

Come on. Let's go.
Move.

Hey, Danny, grab a couple of unis.

We got to inventory
these illegal weapons.

Good. More paperwork.

Charger totaled?

Nothing a good body man
can't make right.

Look, your story
about Zadofian panned out.

Good.

Heard the hit man took a hit.

Nature of the job.

I assume you had a chance
to chat with him...

...before he took two
in the chest?

Yeah, we did.

Lucky for us.

That eliminates
the immediate threat.

Looks like
I'm gonna need you...

...to get my family
clear of this thing.

Well, then I'm here
for you, Vic.

Yeah.

I got a plan on how to deal
with the rest of this problem...

...but I'll tell you
back at the Barn.

I don't understand.
That trial is over.

Just closing out
some unfinished details.

Do you know
Hector Jimenez?

Sure.

According to the detective
on the case...

...you were with him
on the night of the murder.

When was the last time
you saw Hector?

This morning.

He's my boss.

And your fiance now, right?

Yeah. So what?

Do you know
Emilio Borrego?

Yeah.

- He's a friend of Hector's?
- Hello.

Glad to see your work ethic
has remained intact, detective.

Insardi. What do you want?

Wagenbach put in a request
to reopen this case.

I'm gonna see why.

Guess you're sitting
this one out, huh?

I'm on disability.

Oh, good. Maybe we'll actually
convict somebody.

They're good friends.

We need to spin that
fiction, make Rezian believe...

...the Mexicans are the Armenians'
worst problem since the Turks.

I know just what lie
to tell him.

Give us a minute.

I just got off the phone
with Phillips.

Save the touching
goodbye speech.

The decision on your badge
has been pushed.

Commissioner nebel has taken
an indefinite leave.

Health reasons.

And it will be at least 30 days before
they can assemble a new committee.

I don't know what kind of
voodoo you're using...

...or whose arm
you're twisting.

Just be grateful.

You got another month of Mackey
to firm up your stats.

Gardocki will be leading
this team.

You start feeling
like you got nothing to lose...

...you act out in any way,
it'll be a black markin his jacket.

You don't give a shit
about risking your future...

...that's fine.

Maybe you'll think twice
when it's your friend's.

Fewer and fewer of those
friends around these days.

Lorena's sticking to her story.

Too scared to tell the truth.

Insardi's one smug bitch.

Sure seems
to be gunning for you.

Said I was incompetent,
right?

Said something like
the only thing weaker...

...than your detective skills
was your backbone.

What? Don't worry about it.

It's not your problem anymore.

You work for Hector's siding
company, vice president of sales.

Yes.

Two years ago you told me
Hector was at your house...

...eating Chinese food
the night Doris was killed.

I don't remember
all the details.

You lied for Hector,
gave him an alibi...

...so he could go kill
Emilio's wife.

No. I was with him.

- He didn't do anything.
- Bullshit.

Emilio told us the whole story,
sweetheart.

I know he's the one getting his joint
greased in big-titty heaven now.

Wants to marry you.

Get Hector out of the equation.

I didn't...
That's not my fault.

No, but you lying
for Hector...

...makes you and your twins
co-conspirators.

And I'm sure those fat,
white guards in double-d block...

...already have a come-stained cot
with your name on it.

You got one chance
to save your ass...

I didn't know about the killing
until afterwards.

Swear to God. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

The last of the Ak-47s.

Get that area
behind me next.

If I wanted to spend
my life doing inventory...

...I would have worked
for my uncle Manny, you know?

What happened?

Turned my back for a second.

Guy jumps out
from behind this crap.

Took off.

That guy could have been armed.

Who the hell cleared this room?

I... I'm not sure
who cleared it.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

I'm just glad
nobody was hurt.

If I find out who failed
to clear this room...

...somebody's out of a job.

Steve, come on in.
Sit down.

First, I want to apologize
for that outburst earlier.

It was unprofessional.

Yeah,
and very mean-spirited.

Second, I want to thank you
for solving that murder for us.

It will really help
with our quarterly stats.

You were on the top
of your game.

Yeah, I get these little bursts
of energy...

...you know, in between needing
to lie down and so forth.

Well, don't be modest,
Steve.

You work for Hector's siding company,
vice president of sales...

...headaches, disorientation,
lethargy...

...memory loss,
inability to logic.

What's your point?

Your scam's over.

We've got proof you've been
faking your head injury.

This doesn't prove shit.

With the tape and our testimony
from your performance today...

...your lawsuit is dead.

Maybe we throw in your history
of defrauding the city...

...with your little
vending machine enterprise.

All right. Look.

Last thing I ever wanted to do
was hurt the department.

I will call my attorney and have
her take the settlement offer.

You'll take nothing.

You'll be glad I didn't
fire you, pull your pension.

I spoke to Phillips.

You'll be back to work
tomorrow morning.

If you want to quit,
it's up to you.

I'll have to consult
with my legal team.

Just as long as you're here
tomorrow morning first thing...

...you can consult
till your hair grows back.

What are you doing, Cass?

That S.U.V.'s been sitting
down the block all day.

It's just a neighbor,
sweetie.

Pack your stuff, kids.

We're going home.

My lesbo lawyer says I'm
required to return to work.

Make myself available
to render services.

Well, it's good
to have you back, Steve.

Yeah, I'll be back,
all right.

Putting in my required hours,
mandatory paperwork.

But as far as effort goes,
I don't know what's between zero...

...and the city mandate minimum,
but from now on...

...let's just call that the Billings.

Can't we just call it
business as usual?

Here's the blood-test report
from Mackey's ex-wife's house.

This matches Ari Zadofian...

...the Armenian we found dead
in the hotel today.

Where were Vic and his guys
when this went down?

Vic was here with me.

The rest of his guys
were running down leads.

Strike team seems clear
on this one.

Of course they do.

How you holding up?

I'm struggling.
New medication.

Well, you're doing great.

If you need anything,
let me know.

I found Zadofian.

You turn him over
to my guys?

Not unless your guys work
for the county coroner.

He's dead.

The first thing I ask you to do
turns to shit.

What's turned to shit is your
control over little Armenia.

I found Zadofian...

With two bullets to the chest
and his feet chopped off.

Old-school retribution.

That was Diro
sending you a message.

She has no power anymore.

She's reaching out...

To the Mexicans.

The word on the street
is she's forming an alliance.

We've never trusted
the wetbacks.

Well, this is L.A., baby.

It's latino land, and she sees
the writing on the wall.

I know every Mexican gang
from here to Sinaloa...

...which means that nothing
happens to Vic's family...

...or you lose the only guy
who can stop Diro...

and her Mexican threat.

I hope commissioner Nebel's
health problem isn't too serious.

Nothing three weeks
in the Caribbean...

...with his mistress
can't cure.

Gives me 30 days
to evaluate your effectiveness...

...see if your stay of execution
should become permanent.

Found out the name
of one of your former employees...

...who were stealing secrets.

Aramboles.

What about the files?

He sold them to Rezian.

Whatever's in that box
is giving him big balls.

The Armenians are making a hard
play for your Barrio sandbox.

And while you're judging
my effectiveness...

...you just keep something
in mind.

There's no other cop
in this town...

...who knows those Balkan psychos
better than I do.

Yeah?

Corrine and Cassidy
left a few minutes ago.

I think she recognized me.

Oh, shit.

All right. Keep on them.

- Shane here?
- No.

What do you want
with him?

The truth.

I know what shane did
to you.

Oh, so he told you.

- He told you.
- He had to.

Vic came here last night
and did the same thing to me.

Payback.

Vic? No.

He didn't know about
the bogus Armenian threat.

He thought Shane
was trying to hurt him...

...by scaring you
and your daughter.

What Armenian threat?

Shane was acting out
on some bullshit tip...

...for some banger in county.

I guess one of us
is being lied to.

Listen, Vic's had this ex-cop
watching us all day long, okay?

And I don't know what's going on
between.

I do, and it's hurting
both our families.

Now, if our husbands
won't stay away from each other...

...then maybe we need to step in
so that...

So that somebody doesn't get hurt.

Cassidy?

Zadofian's prelim
crime-scene report.

Holy shit.

His shoes were attached
when I left him.

Guess who the first detective
on the scene was.

I know. Shane.

Rezian must have sent him
looking for Zadofian.

The feet were some kind
of message to Diro.

There he is.

Shane is neck-deep
in Armenian shit.

Listen,
we got to keep him close...

...make him feel safe,
just like old times...

...as soon as we get this situation
under control.

What you did for me today,
I'll never forget.

I thought pulling the trigger
would be the hard part...

Don't you ever get sucked into
that black hole that got Shane.

You got any idea how Zadofian
got that pedicure?

It was like that
when I got on the scene.

Why?

It's just he had both
of his feet...

...when we got done
talking to him.

Look, Rezian wanted me to find
Zadofian before the cops did...

...turn him over to his guys.

I chopped off the feet to make
it look like Diro's handiwork.

No idea who shot him.

You?

Probably was Diro.

Right.

Well, either way,
it helped sell the story.

Told Rezian that Diro's made
some new greasy friends.

Did like you said.

Convinced him that the Mexicans
were his biggest threat.

Good.

I got the Mexicans thinking
that the Armenians...

...are making a power play
for the Barrio.

And we help
both sides win.

Could get real bloody
real fast.

The sooner they bleed out,
the sooner my family's safe.

So...

What now?

We just sit back...

...watch the gang war.

This may take a few days.

What about today?

Today I watch my back.

Vic didn't get another crack
at me.

Just be careful, okay?

Always. Come here.

I love you...

...so much.

We'll always be together.

All of us.

Bye-bye, buddy.




I love you.

Talk to you later.

Okay.

Bye.

Vic.

I wanted to talk to you
outside of the job.

I didn't feel good about the
tone of our last conversation.

Especially on my end.

I appreciate the apology.

But if you're interested
in doing the right thing...

...you'll relinquish
your rights to Lee.

Can I come in
so we can talk this over?

No, he's about to wake up.

- I've got to feed him.
- I'll make it quick.




This is for him.

It's one of those things
you hang over the crib.

It's supposed to be good
for the hand-eye thing.

Thanks.

Look, Danny, I don't want us
to be at odds over our boy.

Then sign the quitclaim form.

Well, you hit me up
with your paperwork...

...and I'm just here
to give you a heads-up...

...I'm about to hit you up
with mine.

Court-ordered DNA test.

I'm pursuing
my legal remedies.

Jesus Christ. You wana
have a kid so bad?

I know a lot of women
who'd like to get knocked up.

I've got things to do.

We can slug it out in court...

...spend a lot of time and money
we don't have...

...or we can work together
on a plan.

Vic, don't you dare
turn this into something ugly.

I'm just trying to
figure out a way...

...that we can make an arrangement...

...that we could both live with
that acknowledges my rights...

...and my responsibilities
as the father.

That's it.

All right.

Look, I can pull the court order
at any time between now...

...and the end of business
tomorrow.

You let me know
how you want to handle it.

Director Chaffee, when these
files turned up in my office...

...I realized that Cruz Pezuela
was using them...

...to blackmail prominent citizens.

Any idea why this anonymously
landed on your doorstep?

I wouldn't want to speculate.

Well, my guess is whoever
was sitting on this got nervous...

...after the Martin killing.

Realized his file was in there...

...which could implicate him
in a murder...

...wanted to dump
the hot potato.

Mr. Pezuela is one of the biggest
contributors to my campaign.

But that doesn't buy him any rhythm.

If anything, it obliges me
to bend over backwards...

...to see that he is brought
to justice.

RHD has been running
the Martin case.

As lead detective, I'd be open to some
sort of joint investigation here.

Take a look at this.

Armando Rios, veteran lieutenant
in the Mexican drug cartel.

We believe the cartel
is using Pezuela as a front...

...for their California operation.

What are we looking at here,
detective?

I met with Rios.

I tried to develop him
as an intel asset.

I was trying to prove your hunch.
Connecting him to Pezuela.

When i realized that
Martin's file was in there...

...My first impulse was to go
to detective Mackey...

...figuring it could be
evidence in a homicide.

So, in point of fact...

...you didn't come to I.C.E.
first with these files.

Vic and I thought it could
be managed at a local level.

But after the Armenian
bloodbath...

...we both realized that this was
more than Farmington division...

- ... was equipped to handle.
- Right.

You knew this was
an RHD investigation.

You were instructed
to stand down.

I was already hip deep.

I wanted to put
the pieces together...

...And bring you a package
with a bow on it.

Well, it's pretty clear
detective Mackey...

...disobeyed a direct order
by meddling...

...which we'll deal with
on our end.

That said, if you'd like to embed a
couple of your agents with my team...

...this agency will take it
from here.

Sir. Sir, my people
are down the line.

- They're ready to go.
- This in an I.C.E. investigation now.

Hey, you just cost me a high-profile
case you little prick.

I'll try to live with
the disappointment.

Thank you.

Well, Vic, it looks like
Pezuela's blackmail box...

...is finally someone
else's headache.

I thought you wanted to take
down that menudo shitter...

...so you could get credit
for cleaning up Farmington.

Oh, I intend to.

Plus, kissing I.C.E. into this
should win me some friends...

...at a federal level.

Pezuela's gonna grind up
half of L.A...

...before these dipshits
come up with a code name...

...for their operation.

But I guess as long as the times
gets a photo of you...

...in an I.C.E. windbreaker,
that's all that really matters, right?

You know, I just handed you
an alibi in there...

...while you were
on surveillance...

...jawboning with one
of Pezuela's thugs.

What about Olivia?

Her file's in there.

By giving it back,
you might as well have...

...pushed her in front
of a freight train.

Yeah, well, I took out
Olivia's file.

You gave it back to her?

No.

But I got it out
of a bad situation.

Bet she can't wait until
that bill comes due.

How'd it go?

Another Mexican donkey show...

...and Aceveda had me playing
the reluctant virgin.

- Seen Shane this morning?
- Not yet.

We're gonna talk about finishing
what we started?

Bad enough I called an audible...

...trying to pull Shane
out of there...

...and you didn't back my play.

Because you were right
the first time.

Yeah, and now we have no idea
what Shane knows...

...what he suspects,
or what he'll do.

On a good day,
this prick's a wild card.

I've known Shane from way back
before the strike team.

He wasn't always like this.

So?

I played a big part
in where he is right now.

I got to own that.

That's why you got to
put him down.

I got a daughter traipsing
around in a French maid's outfit...

...in front of boys
popping "X".

Is that the way you'd advise me
to deal with her, too, huh?

I'm gonna work with her...

...try to get her
going straight again.

And maybe that's what
I have to do to Shane.

I'll fix him, too.

I wish that you could hear
your goddamn rationalizations.

Vic, you need to be
downtown in an hour...

...for your review board hearing.

That's not... That's not
for another two weeks.

Schedule's moved.
You're up.

PBA rep will meet you there.

Termination without pension...

...effective 10 days from now.

Jesus.

What happened?

I didn't have Pezuela's box
to hand them...

...to offset my shaky jacket.

That bastard, Kouf, he's the one
who sealed the deal.

Said I cost him
the Martin investigation.

Didn't follow orders.

Taking down the public face
of the Mexican cartel got you canned?

Apparently, the brass thinks
this asshole shits spumoni.

You're gonna fight this,
right?

- Detective Mackey,
- Jesus, Vic.

We're not done.

In spite of this ruling...

...the final determination's
up to the chief.

Go to your captain, get her
to put in a good word.

I see you're a married man.

Is your wife pretty?

Beautiful.

You mind if I take her to Vegas
for a dirty weekend...

...ride her ass hard
and put her away wet?

What?

Now, that's about the level
of cooperation I can expect...

...from my captain on anything.

Hey, what's this buzz I'm hearing
about them taking your badge?

Done deal. 10 days.

Holy Christ, man.

What are you gonna do?

You doing okay
after that close call?

Yeah, it was a long, dark night
to think about what almost happened.

Just makes you want to
hug your kid and not let go.

You're telling me.

Yeah, thank god I'm
blessed with a wife...

- ... who loves me to death.
- That's right.

So, you want to track
down those Mexis...

...that put me in the middle
of that shooting gallery?

Damn straight.

Let's find out what bullshit
we're facing here first.

What are we looking at?

Ag assault, working girl,
sketchy vitals.

Why'd you dime us?

Strike team has no stake
in a half-dead blow girl.

A co-worker found her,
said she knows you.

What is it with you and whores?

I was trying to keep them
from tempting you.

We might as well start
getting the cameras going.

Don't work up a sweat.
I'll be quick.

Where's the chickenhead?

This pretty lady
waiting right there.

Hey, baby.

You're upset.

Vic.

It's me. Farrah.

Holy Jesus Christ.

You've got to get the guy
who did this.

It was Bombay, our pimp.

A hooker scoring a beat down
is below my pay grade.

A friend of yours
is even lower.

Am and I were getting clean
for each other.

That's why Bombay did this.

He'll be coming for me next.

You had your chance.

I gave you a bus ticket
out of the life.

Instead of doing the smart
thing, you played me.

- Why are you mad at me, Vic?
- I don't give a rat's ass about you, lady!

Did bad shit go down
between us?

I don't, I don't rember.

You don't remember whose cock you
gagged on this morning, either.

I'm not like that anymore.

Amber and me had two weeks
without using.

We're going to meetings
and everything.

Hey, Vic, the EMTS
just pronounced her.

She, She's dead?

Oh, my god. Oh, my...

You've got to catch
the guy who did this.

Please, Vic. Please, Vic.

Get this skank on record
and get her out of here.

I thought you were
gonna help me.

I accidently touched you...

...and I haven't had a tetanus
shot in a while.

My girl gets murdered
and you don't give a shit?

- Don't care I'm next?
- By me, that's euthanasia.

Vic.

I've already been down
the road with this slut.

Her mouth is only good
for two things...

...and one of them's
lying through her teeth.

I need help, Vic!

Have a seat.

When was the last time
you saw Amber?

Yesterday.

She works nights.

The manager at the liquor spot...

...lets her clean up in the back sink
on the way home from the stroll.

Usually gets to the car about
the time the sun comes up.

When she didn't show,
I knew something was bad.

You told Vic you know who did it.

Damn straight.

Our pimp, Bombay.

How do you know it was him?

Cause he said he was gonna.

Bombay turns you out...

...puts you on the track...

...you don't leave.

Where's Bombay get his drugs?

Manufactures them.

Crystal's the main gig.

Running bitches is just a hobby.

Said it's like
owning race horses.

I trusted you.

Now I find you had Pezuela's
box the whole time.

Yeah, I had the box...

...and you were in it.

I had to make sure
I could trust you.

And I lost the box to Aceveda...

...and he flipped it over to your
boss against my objections.

Know a good trial attorney?

Aceveda pulled your file
before he turned it over.

Why?

One side of his mouth...

...he would call it a good deed.

The other would call it
leverage over you...

...for favors to be named later.

So I've traded one blackmailer
for another?

You're been granted a reprieve.

That's all that matters
right now.

My here and now is how
to bring down Pezuela...

...in the 10 days
I still have a badge...

...because there's no way in hell...

...the geniuses in your agency
are up for the job.

Chaffee's making this case
a priority.

Whatever that means.

Rios has disappeared.

Pezuela's insulated.

He knows there's heat.

You need someone on the inside...

...and that only means me.

Chaffee will never go for it.

Far as he's concerned...

...local cops are either
incompetent or dirty.

Really?
What's his plan, then?

He's gonna raid Pezuela's
construction site today.

Looking for what?

Surveillance has Rios going into
that job site two days ago.

He was never witnessed
coming out.

We find a body...

...Chaffee goes after Pezuela
on conspiracy homicide.

You're not gonna find a body.

Trust me.

And the only thing
this raid is gonna do...

...is send Pezuela scurrying
for his bunker.

You have to stop it.

I could tip Pezuela off...

...keep alive the fiction
he's still got a hook in me.

I got a way we can both
curry some favor.

By the end of business...

...the feds are gonna be crawling
all over this place.

Where did you get
the information?

I got a real deep
throat in D.C...

...tipped me the local office is waiting
on approval to move forward.

A local cop with federal reach.

Well, when you're a grower
not a shower...

...it helps to have a deep throat
with no gag reflex.

And if your information
should have some merit?

Then we should start talking
about a promotion and a raise.

I had another thought.

This week's pay and severance.

You haven't found my missing box...

...and in 10 days...

...you won't have a badge.

You're no use to me.

Hey, I handed you the Armenians
on a platter...

...and I'm telling you the feds
are about to show up here...

...pry your mouth open...

...and take a big, long piss.

What have you done
for me lately?

Listen man, I have kids.

I'm about to lose my job.

I'm scrambling.

Our business is done.

I was in my room
getting ready for work...

...when someone tried to break in.

I heard the glass, got scared...

...and went for my gun.

Did you get a look at
the intruder before you fired?

Not really.

I yelled, "I have a gun. "

I was just trying to scare him...

...but I think
I might have shot him.

So you probably couldn't
identify him...

...if you saw him again.

You live here alone?

Yeah. This area was supposed
to be on the way up.

I was gonna flip the house
like on those infomercials.

Do me a favor and finish up.

Why?

Claudette's house is
five doors down.

I want to go over and
check it out. Thanks.

All right, no problem.

That's what partners
are for, right?

This is Claudette.
Leave a message.

Hey, Claudette, are you there?

Pick up.

I, uh, see your car here.

I'm, uh, I'm walking up
your front steps.

Pick up.

Hello? Hello? Hello?

That's me knocking.

Oh, shit.

Claudette?!

Claudette?!

Hello?! Claudette?!

Claudette?!

Whatever dance you
and Vic got going on...

...I don't want
to be a part of it.

Vic is taking me to court to
prove that he's my son's father.

I don't want him in our lives.

Period.

I don't even want
child support, okay?

And on a cop's salary?

I can't imagine you want
him paying money...

...that should be going
to you and your kids.

What exactly do you want?

I want sole custody
and no visitation rights.

But the thing is,
to get that...

...I have to make a case to the
judge that he's an unfit parent.

Well, Vic may be
a lot of things...

...but he cares about his kids.

Yeah, well, when Cassidy came
to my house the other day...

...she had a different
take on it.

Okay, sorry.

It's not my business, all right.

It's why I called you
to come get her...

...but Lee is my business.

Come on, you know this guy
better than anybody...

...and with Vic, it's all
about him all the time.

What good does it do my kids
to drag their father's...

...dirty laundry into a courtroom?

Just tell your side of things
to the judge, okay?

The records are gonna be sealed.

They never even have to know.

Corrine, don't even think
about it as a favor to me.

Think about it as a long-term
business decision...

...in the best interest
of your kids.

Hey.

Crime scene's this house,
not mine.

All this excitement right
down the block from you.

I saw your car in the driveway.

Alternator trouble.

Black and white gave me a lift
to work this morning...

...then the neighbors
starting calling...

...which is why I want you
to clear this pronto.

Okay.

See you back at the Barn.

Vinnie's found blood
around the side of the house.

Looks like Annie Oakley
winged the guy.

Let's get a sample.

Tried to get a reading
on Shane.

Looks like he might be
all right.

As long as he's alive...

...we're not all right.

What about saving your badge?

Any ideas?

A squeaking noise like that...

...you probably want to check
your fan belt.

I hear you'll be moving on.

You still got me for
another week and a half.

I'll make a deal with you.

You clean out your locker
and leave today...

...and I'll go personally
to the chief...

...and get a piece of your
pension restored.

I, uh, still got a few
loose ends to tie up.

I'll stick around, thanks.

In that case,

I want your people deployed
on this working-girl murder.

You want the strike team
on pimp patrol?

In addition to murder,
this guy also manufactures...

...and moves meth in quantity,

Which if memory serves...

...is one of the hot spots you people
are supposed to be on top of.

Bombay's government name
is Marcel Letourneau.

Ran his priors, no address.

The girl didn't have
a twenty on him.

Get ready for a long...

...lazy afternoon on the stroll...

...turning down free bjs
while we look for this idiot.

Who said anything about
turning them down?

Count me in.

Farrah did have info on one
of Bombay's new earners.

Calls herself Capuchina.

She probably stole Farrah's
crown as bottom bitch.

Why wouldn't she rat her out?

Anything else?

Pretty much it.

Waiting on forensics.

Shane and I will meet and greet
with Capuchina.

You guys hang tight.

Stay on the lab rats.

Let's do it.

I'll catch up
with you outside.

Come over here.

What's going on?

Danny came to see me.

What did she want?

First, why don't you tell me...

...why you want joint custody?

You don't have to worry
about any of that.

Tell me,
I'll stop worrying.

Why do you want
shared custody?

Because I have
shared responsibility.

That's bullshit, Vic.

You've had 14 years...

...to be the most important part
of Cassidy's life.

Never once has she been
your top priority.

Given where she is
in her life right now...

...I'd do things differently.

I don't want to make
the same mistake with Lee.

This baby gives you
a do-over?

How can I be an example
to our three kids...

...look them in the eye...

...if I just walk away
from this other child?

I mean, they know about him,
for Christ's sake.

How can I prove to Cassidy
that I love her...

...if I won't even fight
for my son?

Now, goddamn it,
what did Danny want?

You out of the picture.

She wants me to help her
to make a case...

...that you're not fit
to even see this kid.

Are you signing on?

I know why you think
you want this...

...but you need to ask yourself if...

...you're just putting up a fight...

...just because you're a fighter...

...or if this is what's best
for this kid.

- You don't...
- And before you answer...

...Just sit with the question.

What's up?

Shit can jump off with these
187 cats, man.

Detective...

...do you smell the sickly sweet
odor of cannabis sativa?

- Yes, indeed I do.
- Yep.

Sit down.

Bag of skunk...

...drug paraphernalia...

...undisclosed earnings.

Possession of a concealed weapon.

Jesus Christ.

I keep that around
for protection.

One of my regulars likes me
to use it on his nuts.

Who could blame him?

What do you boys want?

We want to find Bombay.

That gray bitch turned you
on to me, didn't she?

What do you know
about Farrah?

Bitch couldn't handle
her business.

Chose the white smoke
over her black pimp.

Bitch is paying the price now.

Word on the street is Bombay
murdered her squeeze.

Shit, white Farrah
ain't right in the mind...

...why she got kicked to the curb.

I'm down for mine.
Got vision.

Run bitches on my own one day...

...be an entrepreneur.

Well, you help us find Bombay...

...and we'll sponsor you
for the rotary club.

Baby, I don't do anal.

What about bondage?

Now you can add obstructing
a police investigation to the list.

I swear that nigga only come
around here...

...to hit my shit
and hold his paper.

- Stop fighting me.
- Two-Man will know where he's at!

- Who's Two-Man?
- His boy.

- Collects his dope money.
- Where do we find him?

- I don't know.
- What's he look like?

Big, ugly,
black as a flat tire.

Puts a hurt on folks
who can't pay.

Man, talk to Farrah.

She'll know where Two-Man's at.

Word, if I knew anything else...

...I'd tell y'all
'cause I don't love county.

Two-Man collects in the jungles
every mother's day...

...when the county checks
come in.

That's his car.

Ronnie, suspect vehicle's
on your left.

- Pull over where you can.
- Got it.

So how come you didn't
turn us on to this guy...

...when we interviewed you
back at the Barn?

I don't know.

I didn't think of it.

Wasn't sure if he's still
working for Bombay.

Now, we are gonna sit here
until this guy shows up...

...and you're gonna point him
out to us.

- When are we gonna...
- Until then, we're gonna keep...

...talking to a minimum.

There's been a 15% increase in
B and E's the last three months...

...in Claudette's neighborhood...

...mostly electronics and jewelry.

A couple private security
companies working that area now.

Figured they're worth
a conversation.

Rent-A-Cops?

More like rent an ex-cop.

PRP protection is owned by guys
who used to be on the job.

We should call over.

May be one of their patrols
saw something.

Way ahead of you, Dutch man.

As a matter of fact,
this must be my guy.

Lester,
thanks for coming in.

Are you kidding me?
Happy to help.

Say hi to Dutch Wagenbach.

- Hey.
- Hey.

So, ex-cops running
a security company.

It's genius.

I think I see my future.

I recognized an opportunity...

...no-brainer, really.

I got a business bone myself.

What are you into?

Most recently vending machines...

...Not the cheap stuff.
High-End...

...gourmet food and beverages.

Good money there?

Oh.

It's not bad.

So, what can I do
for you guys?

Uh, recent increase in B and E's
in your service area...

...what do you make of it?

Gentrification.

You got white people moving in...

...'cause the real estate's
cheaper...

...and they bring better
gear to steal.

For the blacks and mexicans...

...it's a crowbar christmas.

Company logs and files
for the past three months.

It's a general who's who
and what's what...

...of crimes that we responded to
in the area.

I'd take a look at a couple
of troublemakers in particular.

Elliott Gallardo, He's
a recently paroled crackhead...

...lives in the area.

The other guys's
called Paolo.

He owns the luxury pawn shop
down on sixth.

Got an interesting way
of compensating...

...for his low inventory.

You gonna break this whole
thing on your own?

Here's a new one.
White shirt coming out the gate.

That's him right there.

It's Two-Man.

Stay in the car.

Try to keep your clothes on.

Stop! Police!

Look out!

The court! Cut him off!

Shane, wake up, brother!

Up and at 'em!

Yo, watch out, man.

Take it easy!
Take it easy!

Hey!

Shut your hole.

Don't move.

We're looking
for Bombay Letourneau.

Who?

How's that?

I understand you do this for
a living, except to girls.

If anybody feels the need to
write me up for excessive force...

...you better do it
in the next 10 days.

You gonna break it!

Get up! Get up!

Up!

Give me your hand.

Tell us where he is.

We'll forget all about
this track and field tryout...

...and you get to keep this.

That grip belong to Bombay.

Well, he won't be
needing that anymore.

He got a new cook-up spot
in the dust bowl...

...off the five
in Glassell Park.

I think he broke
my goddamn jaw, man.

You broke your own jaw,
asshole.

Smells like cat piss.

Means they're in the
middle of a cook-up.

We could probably
catch him off guard.

So, do we wait for uni backup?

We take him hard to the paint...

...they won't know what hit them.

Vic, Connie was always saying
you were nice...

...how you helped her.

Whatever I did to make you mad,
I'm sorry.

My life's different now.

Yeah, mine too.

Four or five people
in the main trailer.

I don't know
about the other one.

We go in, roust everyone...

...little miss claptrap
ID's our bad guy.

You stay here and
keep your mouth shut...

...until we need you to
eyeball mack daddy.

Come on.

Be careful.

Suspect down!

Get out of there!

Get out of the trailer!

Let's go right now!

Get against the wall.

Spread 'em against the wall.

Clear!

- Ronnie, you got that?
- Clear! Get out of here!

Julien, clear that other
structure!

Clear!

I did what I had to do.

You fellas took a few rounds.

I only returned two shots.

Okay, I don't want you
talking to anyone.

O.I.S. is on its way.

I want you to contact
protectively.

Get a rep standing by, okay?

I.A.D. will take your formal
statement at the Barn.

I'll take possession
of your weapon.

It'll be all right.

One of you guys get him back.

Glad I stuck around.

Might even pick up a letter
of commendation for this one.

Looks good in the jacket.

Raise my rate next gig.

We appreciate all the help.

Hey, just doing my part
as a citizen.

I point them out,
you put them away.

That sounds like a plan.

Thanks.

Hey, Danny,
you got a minute?

What's up?

Danielle Sofer?

Yeah.

You are hereby ordered
to appear in family court...

...on the date indicated.

Have a good day.

You son of a bitch.

You told me I had
until tomorrow night.

That was before
you went behind my back...

...and dragged Corrine
into this.

Shredding another family
for your own agenda...

...isn't gonna win you "world's
best mom" in a courtroom.

Guess we do this
the hard way.

After all the shit you pulled
Corrine through...

...she comes crawling back to you
like a whipped puppy.

Jesus Christ...

...what kind of hold do you have
on that poor woman anyway?

She understands
a basic human concept.

Children need fathers.

Now, I'm not gonna
let you puzzle...

...over that little brain teaser
one more day...

...at my son's expense.

You missed one hell of a show
at Pezuela's place.

Two helicopters with
thermographic display...

...field command module
with satellite uplink...

...two dozen agents,
canine team...

...and a posse
of forensic accountants.

And your boss came up
with jack shit and no body.

Your tax dollars at work.

Chaffee walked himself
out onto a limb...

...with the big boys in D.C.
on this one.

And the limb just snapped.

When can you get me into
a room with Chaffee?

I'll find out.

Hey, Vic.

There was a guy here earlier,
Lester Spirakus, ex-cop.

You know him?

I've seen him around. Why?

I got a sense you two
had some history.

Good ob. You should be
a detective.

Guy's an asshole,
into all kinds of wrong shit.

Really?

What did he do now?

Well, maybe nothing.

If you think
he did something shitty...

...he probably did.

Captain, I need signatures
on last week's O.T. reports.

I couldn't help catching
you and Vic square off earlier.

Sorry about that.
It won't happen again.

Is that a promise
you can keep?

Probably not.

And not even
for the next 10 days?

Vic's being terminated.

He'll be gone after that.

Wow.

I don't mean
to insert myself...

...but if I've got a personnel
problem on my hands...

...even a short-term, I'd like
to know what I'm dealing with.

Captain, it's not
a secret around here.

I mean, everybody knows
Vic is the father.

I've heard rumors.

I tried to keep him
out of the mix.

It's just that things
have gotten really messy.

You ought to know that that's
the book on Vic going in.

Right.

I think I was just focused
on the baby of it all.

Take whatever time you need.

Handle your business.

I don't want to leave you
in the lurch.

I can look out for myself...

...and you should do the same.

Talked to Elliott the crackhead.

Alibi checks out.

Four people saw him stealing food
from the soup kitchen this morning.

How do you steal
from a soup kitchen?

That was his argument.

How about we head over
to the pawn shop...

...perform a three-ball squeeze?

Hey, maybe we've been going
in the wrong direction.

What about Lester?

That's a good one.

I've been going through
these logs he gave us.

Most of his new accounts
are from residences...

...where there
were recent 211s.

It makes sense.

Probably gets a list of
B and E's from a friendly cop.

Or maybe he's staging
them himself...

...to create a market
for his product.

He's an ex-cop,
for Christ's sake.

Then let's let him come in
and clear himself.

You showed your hand...

...and a covert investigation
came up empty.

I'm out of my department on
my ass because of this thing.

Sounds like we both
had a bad day.

I have a way to take
our respective shit piles...

...and recycle them
into something useful.

Pezuela's guard's up.

It's gonna take more than you
turning your pockets inside out...

...to get next to him.

That's why I have to deliver
something that matters to him.

I have to give him back
the blackmail box.

We'd be handing the man
a loaded gun.

Do the math.

If someone like Pezuela can't lean
on people to do his bidding...

...it costs him
juice with the cartel.

The harder it becomes for us
to use him...

...to move up the food chain.

Now, I'm in your wing tips...

...I'm going after the guy...

...that's making Pezuela
lose sleep at night.

And the box by itself is nothing...

...but a tell-all
about human weakness.

It doesn't even get you Pezuela.

Let him put the box in play.

That keeps him positioned
as the cartel's go-to guy.

At the very least...

...we get him on conspiracy
and extortion.

With me on the inside
keeping a travel log...

...of all the dark and dirty
places he visits.

Unless you have a better plan.

Only one problem
with your idea.

Pezuela's gonna smell a rat...

...when he gets this back
and your file's not inside it.

Especially since he knows the
agency's dogging his every move.

That's why I've got to get it
back from Aceveda...

...and put it back inside.

You gonna be all right with that?

This sting works...

...maybe I'll finally be able
to hang up my kneepads.

Keep them on just a little while
longer and this all goes away.

Aceveda's not gonna
just hand it over.

I already went to his office
today and asked.

I've known David a long time.

It's all about how you ask.

I'm working undercover for I.C.E.

The box is back in play.

We need Olivia's file
in order to sell it to Pezuela.

When the hell did this happen?

You said something
this morning...

...about wanting
to see justice done.

Time to jump on board
the karma train.

I have to handle Pezuela
very carefully.

He can hurt me.

And you, you say you want
to bring him down?

You were just working
for the man.

She had no choice.

Look, I'm sorry...

...but Vic doesn't make a very
compelling character witness.

Holding on to your file
gives me a card to play...

...in case you're ever tempted
to switch sides again.

Here's what happens if you don't
give up the file.

Pezuela doesn't take the bait.

I.C.E. doesn't understand why...

...so they put his balls
through the ringer...

...just on general principle,
and he gives up Olivia anyway.

Then I roll on you
for blackmailing me.

And I back her story.

You two make quite a team.

You know how much of my life I
spent in interrogation rooms?

It's quieter in here.
You mind?

No, I'm fine with it.

What's up, guys?

You mind if
I cut to the chase?

I'd love that.

The more security systems you
sell, the more money you make...

...and what better way
to stimulate demand...

...than breaking into houses.

I spent 15 years on the job.

This is a hell of a way to thank
me for my time and service.

There's a quick and easy
way to clear this up.

Perp got grazed by a bullet...

...left a trail of blood.

What? You want to
check me out?

Why didn't you say so?

53. Still ripped.

You guys are too busy on the job...

...to get to the gym regularly.

I remember.

Um, can you turn around so we
can see the back of your legs?

Liking that ass?

Can I go now or do you want
to tickle my balls?

Uh, your partner,
J.R. Cornelius...

...I'd like to talk to him.

How do I reach him?

He's on vacation.

Since when?

Last weekend.

J.R. wasn't in town
when this happened...

...but you're welcome
to knock on his door.

Woman's here to see someone
from the strike team.

Somewhere we could talk?

Bombay's as hard
as they get...

...but he didn't kill no girl.

Why do you say that?

'Cause I saw who did.

I'm working the track.

Two-Man rolls up on Amber...

...tells her to get in.

Bitch wasn't trying to hear it
on account of knowing...

...what's in store.

Well, just 'cause
she got in his car...

...doesn't mean
that he killed her.

I'm gonna be real with you.

Nigga gets a cut of what he
collects and any pussy he wants.

Only he ain't about
hitting no trim.

He about banging
those shorties.

So he's into rough stuff.

Shit. That brother don't even
get his swole on.

Two-Man
'bout bringing the pain.

All the bitches he sent
to killah king with...

...broken bones and shit.

That's bad for business.

Bombay put up with that?

He never let him beat
on his earners, but, daddy...

...it was open season
on low-end skeezers.

Amber should have taken her beat
down same as every other ho.

The minute she said "no"
it was on.

Two-Man snatched her by the
hair, bashed her in the face...

...banged her head against the car...

...and threw her in the back.

When he drove off I know, I was
never go see that breeze again.

You know, you'd have saved
everybody a lot of time...

...and ammunition if you would
have told us this before.

If I'd have snitched
on Bombay's dude...

I'd be in the mortuary
right behind gray girl.

Pimp juice dead.
It's all good.

Be even safer if you tossed
Two-Man in and lose the key.

You seem like a good person...

...and you're just trying
to do the right thing.

Maybe you saw Two-Man do those
things, maybe you didn't.

I know what I seen.

The point is, you're in a cloud of
chronic all day every day.

You're not a credible witness.

And I also have concerns
about your personal safety.

What if you testify
and we don't get a conviction?

I don't want anything
happening to you.

I'm gonna treat this
as an anonymous tip.

I ain't mad,
keeping it in the cut.

Looks like J.R. decided
to vacation in the E.R...

...out in Riverside.

That's news to me.

He was being treated
for a gunshot wound.

Arrived two hours
after the shooting.

Told the doctors he was
an ex-cop who was wounded...

...when his gun
accidently discharged.

He always was clumsy.

Riverside P.D.
picked him up.

They're bringing him
back here now.

You know what it'll mean for us...

...to be able to clear
all these open B and E's.

Go easier for you if you
tell us what happened.

We found blood
at the crime scene.

When we test it,
it's gonna match J.R.'s.

He's my partner.

Well, I respect
that kind of loyalty...

...and since he's got more
to lose than you do...

...I hope he does, too.

I walk on the B and E's.

Trespassing and vandalism.

Got to make sure you're out of
the home-protection business.

We thought the house was empty.

I was on the lookout
when he went in.

I heard the gunshot...

...and then he came running out.

Then I drove him to his car.

Shit.

Bombay never posted lookouts
during a cook-Up.

He needed everybody in the lab.

So why did he come out
guns blazing?

- The phone call.
- What phone call?

Somebody called his cell...

...said there were cops outside
are gonna kill him.

He told us to get down...

...went for his gun...

...started shooting.

You spun that sob story...

...about your pimp killing
your girlfriend?

You set up Bombay for a
death by cop payback...

...for kicking you out?

He's the one who started
her on the pipe.

He got what he deserved.

I don't give a shit
about your goddamn pimp!

You understand?!

You called him.

You warned him
so he'd come out blasting!

You used me! You used
one of my guys as a shooter!

You could have gotten us
all killed, you sick bitch!

Oh, I used you.

Played you same as last time.

I remember it all now.

You were an asshole
back then, too.

You just keep getting
more pathetic and miserable.

I still got you handling
my business for me.

May not be so pretty any more...

...but I am walking, talking pussy...

...and you let me lead you
around by your dick.

You ever thought
about just cutting it off?

Free your mind
once and for all?

Ha ha. Ha ha.

When I... went already your house
this morning check on you...

I had to brake a window
and go into your house.

Had to!?

I was worried.

And you thought I was lying dead
on the floor because I'm sick.

You live alone, your car was in the
drive way, nobody came to door...

...there was a B and E
down the block...

...and potencialy dangerous
suspect down to loose.

You know I'll send you the bill
for that window.

I know I've been a little ax.

It was obvious you not
taking care of your self.

Changes in your life in work
we need to get you little help.

I don't need help.

- Cloudette...
- The house is messy, I'll clean it up.

Look you have to...
You have to understand...

It takes, every ons of energy
for me to be here...

...every day to do what
I need to get done.

What time I get home
I don't have nothing left.

I, uh, hired you a cleaning lady.

- No!
- Her name is Cecilia...

...she'll be coming on mondays
and thursdays.

- Dutch!
- I will pay for it.

I'll pay for it.

No I will. So I know
she is doing the job.

Is she even legal?

Uh, she is coming on
mondays and thursdays...

...I just need the key,
so she can get in to house.

- Vic, please don't...
- I thought give another shot...

...try to talk this out.

I'm sure both are see
the money worry about...

...the burn through goin to
at least collage, rigth?

O.K.

I give.

But I'm real perimeters
that I can live with.

Now put your name on the bar staficid...

...but I want sole custody.

...and we gone work out
visitation rights.

I can live with that.

I talk to this family arbitrator
she said we can...

...you know sit down
and work out the details.

I'm there. Just tell me
when and where.

Call tomorrow get some times.

Hey, I'm glad we gone be able to
reasonable way through this.

At the end this realy gone
work out for the best.

That's what I want for Lee.

Alright, I'll see in the morning.

See in the morning.

You need get a better lock Two-Men.

Some low life could break in.

You got a warrant?

Shit no.

What do you want do?

Chup it up with you.

But that strawberry
you beat to dead.

- I know nothing about new dead strawberry.
- Cut this shit.

Bombay now the seast F.V...

...only do his gas cruiser part of
your compensation package.

Bombay not kill the bitch.

Who were to tough on Amber?

I got eye vitnesses
how all thing go down.

Now, two different ways
we can handle this.

I'll take you in.

My whore's fingers you arrest you
for murder with special circumstances...

...but you know what that gets you.

Or you can work with me...

...make this whole thing go away.

Work with you, how?

I need you help getting rid to
somebody.

That's gone be looking
somebody in the eye...

...pul in the tricker thou.

You ein't serious.

You don't know how
goddam serious I'm.

Did I know guy, who?

How's your jaw feeling?

Previously on "The Shield"...

Shane need someone
to kill you,

'cause he was waiting
to kill me.

Gardocki: claudette knows we're
gonna be gunning after him.

We just walked vic and a bag
of dirty money into a bust.

Vic: code red.

There's a package.

You know what to do.

This is for you.

Ronnie is
his goddamn errand boy.

What if vic figured out
that I was working with you?




Get this money out of here,
okay?

Keep it.

aah!

ugh!

My shoulder!

ohh!

It's like a knife
in my chest.

Just take me home.

Shane is broke
with an injured, pregnant wife

who just killed her last shot
at getting out of this.

My wife
is not going to jail.

We got to get i.c.e.

To start cutting us deals now.

Not without a big
cartel takedown.




Murray:
the goal is getting beltran

to trust you to the point
where you have access

to the cartel's inner workings.

I've arranged a meet and
greet with you and the

black board of directors.

I don't meet and greet.

I'd be happy
to negotiate terms.

This ain't no proposal.

This is a gank and grab.

Buy-in's 200 large.

Murray:
I couldn't get washington

to sign off on ronnie this fast.

vic:
I don't want half a deal.

When you can offer the same
thing at the same time to

ronnie, then you call me.

Are you gonna arrest vic?

You need to end this now.

What did mara say?

That she and shane
are coming for the money.

I'll meet with you
to pick up the cash.

The cops are there, corrine.

They're watching you.

If we don't have vic on tape,
we got nothing.

How do I explain
all this money?

Sofer: corrine mackey,
you're under arrest.

We got to go through the
motions. Vic may be watching.

vic:
Give me that deal.

You give my ex-wife
a pass on this one

aiding and abetting
and I'll give you beltran

and the whole goddamn cartel.

I can't do anything
for ronnie yet.

Ronnie can wait
until after the bust.

Our strike team was committing
criminal acts

on a regular basis.

What kind of deal
did you give him?

Full immunity on everything
he confesses to.

I shot and killed
detective terry crowley.

He gave up ronnie,
and we're gonna catch shane.

But vic!

You're fired, you sanctimonious
son of a bitch!

This isn't you.

Anything less than
the biggest drug bust

this agency's ever seen
will violate your deal.

Don't worry.

I'll give you beltran
and his entire organization.

You've implicated gardocki
in enough shit

to put him away
for the rest of his life.

I need him
to take down beltran.

I'll string him along
until we're done.

The Shield S07E13 - Family Meeting

SERIES FINAL

Sync: GeR

change in --
Gardocki: how'd the drop-off

with shane go?

Cops were set up
all over corrine.

Must have tapped
her phone.

They arrested her?

She posted bail
an hour ago.

Oh, christ.

I reached out to olivia again,
gave her the hard sell.

and?

She agreed to put something
on paper for both of us,

clear corrine of this, too,
effective as soon as

the beltran bust goes down.

Full immunity for us?

Holy shit.

That's great news.

Hey, let's go feed beltran
the bait.

Beltran: why is my presence
necessary?

These guys want some
face time with their

new business partner
on their first

transaction.

They're ponying up
a shitload of cash.

Gardocki:
this isn't mexico city.

You got to earn trust
up here.

Trust is all the drugs
i'm putting in black hands.

It's a respect thing.

I'll make it quick and painless.

It better be.

Otherwise, I'll promise you
the opposite.

When?

Noon tomorrow.

We're gonna do this
in broad daylight?

I told you, air force one
is landing at l.a.x.

In the afternoon.

80% of the cops
in this city

will be deployed
on the west side.

It's wide open.

Vic cut a deal
with the feds.

Full immunity for you.

I don't need immunity.

Yeah, vic
doesn't know that.

He also got full immunity
for himself.

What?!

He can't be charged
with anything, corrine,

and he confessed
to some heinous shit

you don't even want
to hear.

But he can't be charged
for any of it?

He leveraged a bust they needed
him on into a deal.

They had no idea
the nightmare they were

getting themselves into.

He's free... of everything.

We're arresting ronnie
in the barn tomorrow,

after vic's bust, okay?

Vic has his whole life
to figure out what I did to him.

What is going to happen to me
when he realizes it?!

We have an idea.

You have an idea?!

I have children!

What am I gonna do?!

Sewell:
okay, buddy, we're home.

[ doorknob rattles,
door opens ]

here we go.

I'm gonna play
with that big dump truck.

Okay.

Is that a dump truck?

It's in your room, honey.

Go in your room, okay?

Go ahead.

Go on.

Jackson: mommy?

Shane?

What?

What, baby?

What's gonna happen to him...

When they catch us?

Nothing.

Nothing,
'cause they're not.

Come on.

All right.

We're just resting here.

All right, now.

I am, uh, gonna get you
to feeling better,

and, uh, uh, tomorrow morning,
when the prez hits town

and all the unis
are rolling west side,

we're gonna hit the road
once and for all.

I can't take
a car trip, shane.

Sure, you can.

My mother won't
take jackson in --

Not that I want that bitch
anywhere near him.

There's no one
in your family.

They're gonna put him
in foster care, aren't they?

no.

Don't lie to me, shane.

They're gonna put him
in foster care.

Oh, god.

ohh!

What, baby?

What's wrong?

Here.

Jackson: mommy!

mm.

I'll be right there, baby!

What's he gonna think of us
when he finds out?

When they tell him
who his real parents are?

I'm not gonna --
What's he gonna think?

I'm not gonna let
any of that happen.

You got to get these disaster
fantasies out of your head.

And our daughter?

no.

I'll give birth to her
in a prison,

and they'll take her
away from me.

They're gonna rip her away
from me, aren't they?

Baby, she's always
gonna be ours.

Let -- let's name her...

Okay?

Before anybody else can,
let's --

Let's give her a name.

Okay.

What do you want
to name her?

Frances.

Frances?

Yeah.

Frances what?

Frances abigail.

Whenever she does
something cute,

we can call her
franny abby.

Morning, captain.

Good morning.

We've got business to do.

We sure do.

I left some papers
on your desk to sign.

W- what are you doing here?

Seems like
i'm in the right spot.

I heard the doctor tell you last
night, "no stress, stay home."

Didn't I fire you?

It didn't take.

Immunity for mackey.

I've got to do something
about... something.

That ship has sailed.

You need to take care
of yourselfnow.

Oh, my doctor's prescribed
some new meds.

They seem to be working,
and I still got business.

I'm on the clock,
so make it quick.

We need you to put
corrine mackey and her kids

in federal witness protection.

And why would I do that?

Because she's been helping us
make a case against vic.

Then you set her up somewhere,
on your nickel.

Vic's local reach
is too dangerous.

And we can't control him,
since you've given him immunity

for every depraved act
he ever committed.

Exactly. So why would I do him
this one last favor?

Because it's a favor for me,
not him.

Because corrine and her kids
need protection

in case he finds out
that she helped us.

And he's your monster now
and you want to hurt him,

and this is a way to do that.

hey.

Hey, kids.

Hey, dad.

Listen, I'm sorry
about the arrest.

Well, I'm out now.

Did they treat you
all right?

I just want
to forget about it.

Well, good news, then.

I took care of it.

It's all over.

how?

I gave the feds
something that they want.

You've been cleared
of any wrongdoing in return.

Are you gonna be okay?

Oh, yeah, I'm --
I'm gonna be good.

I just wanted to check in
with you and the kids,

and I just wanted to kiss
the most beautiful children

ever.

Mwah, mwah!

Hey. Hey, buddy.

Mwah!

Hi, beautiful.

Mwah!

Hey, you want me to drop you off
at soccer on my way?

I'm not going to soc--
Vic, we have a routine,

so please let us stick to it.

Okay, I'm just --
I'm just offering.

Okay.

I love you guys.

Love you.

Hey, score a goal for me,
okay?

I'll see you.

Yeah, okay.

Matthew: bye, dad.

I thought you said
I wasn't going to soccer today.

That's right.

What's going on?

Hey, steve.

Holy shit.

Let's just have a civil
conversation so I don't have

to pull out my gun, okay?

Sounds good.

'cause I'll do it,
and you know that, right?

They're saying some pretty awful
things about you, shane.

Well, I did
some pretty awful shit, steve.

I need you to deliver a message
to claudette for me.

That woman that mara shot
was in self-defense.

Yeah, well, that woman died.

They were trying
to kick the shit out of me.

Okay? Mara was defending me.

Those guys are saying
that you tried to roll them.

I'm just trying
to be truthful with you.

I don't give a shit
what they said.

I'm sorry, okay?

I don't give a shit
what they said, steve! Okay?

Mara's not a criminal.

If you were committing
a crime, mara can't

claim self-defense.

Look, I'm not asking
for your legal opinion, steve.

Just deliver the message.

Mara was acting
in self-defense...

And she hasn't wanted to do
any of this shit.

She only did it because
she didn't have a choice.

She was scared of me.

She was scared for her life,
and she did what I made her do.

Okay.

Okay.

Uh, this is a lawyer.

You tell claudette,
if she wants me

to turn myself in today,
i'd testify to everything

that she needs
to put vic and ronnie

in prison forever and a day.

All she has to do
is call that guy

and guarantee that mara
does not do any time.

Now, I'll check in with him
in four hours.

And as soon as I get
the word

that mara is clear
of any and all charges...

I'll walk
into the barn myself.

How'd he seem?

Calmer than I'd be,
but worried.

He just wants
to protect mara.

Thanks for bringing this to us
right away.

Of course.

uhh.

You okay?

Shane doesn't know
vic beat him to a deal.

Yeah, he's got nothing valuable
to give us --

At least, not to trade
for kicking down

his wife's murder charge.

So, how do we get him
to come in anyway?

[ indistinct conversations
in distance ]

brown man
running behind schedule?

Is that all the cash?

Why don't you let me worry
about my business?

All this muscle, the mexicans
are gonna think you lack trust.

All that money, mexicans
will understand the caution.

Vic: let's just
keep it friendly.

ah.

Right on schedule.

Target's on the premises.

Hey! Where's beltran?!

Man: jefe is a busy man.

He considers this
a simple transaction.

We gave "jefe" 200 g's
of good faith.

We're expecting him
to show some respect

to his new business
associates.

You only gave him 100 grand.

And if I were you, I would keep
your expectations low.

You ain't even straight
on how much money

we already dropped.

My expectations
can't get any lower.

This is supposed to be
a partnership meeting,

not a street-level drug deal.

Here's what your 100 g's
bought you.

If we like what you do with it,
there will be more.

You promised us product,
not sample!

I brokered this goddamn deal!

I set the terms!

I expect your boss
to live up to them!

These people need to prove
themselves as businessmen first!

Ain't that some... bullshit!

What he just say?!

Let's go.

Run out of here now!

go!

Let's not walk away
empty-handed.

All units, move in now.

Right now, get out of here.

Federal agents!

What the hell is this?!

Right there!

Right there!

Get your hands up!

Shane!

Jackson: daddy?

What's your need,
sweet thing?

I got to go
to the bathroom.

Uh, okay.

I can't get up.

Is it that bad?

Mm-hmm.

I need another pill.

Well, you took
the last pill.

But I know where
to get a bunch more.

Let me get him
out of the tub,

and I'll go score them
for you, okay?

Wait, no.

I got to go to the bathroom.

Okay.

All right, well,
let me help you up.

Okay.

Okay.

I'm gonna put my hand
back under here.

Okay.

aah!

Okay.

I can't hold it.

The baby's...

Come on.

Some just came out.

It's okay.

I just pissed myself, shane.

It's not okay.

It's okay.

We're almost there.

Okay, let me, uh,
let me get your pants. Okay?

Hold on.

Uh-huh.

Okay, all right.

We're gonna sit down.

I got you.

oh.

Hi, mommy.

Hey, jackson.

ahh.

You know,
it's my fault, mara.

hmm?

Everything.

You were so... innocent.

You were so innocent
and so... wonderful.

And I ruined it.

no.

I took you for granted.

This whole time, i, uh...

I just needed to be
more like you.

And I'm so sorry.

Baby... all we ever wanted
was to be with you.

That's all we ever needed.

Yeah.

Okay.

I got it.

All right, come here.

Yeah.

All right,
let's go, let's go.

All right.

Hey, get this shit
off me.

ugh.

You blew the whole deal!

We wanted beltran,
not his goddamn chauffeur!

Right now, the only thing I want
is to be finished with you.

You got your immunity.

What do you care
if I get what I want?

You're willing to shit
on a headline bust

just because
you're pissed off at me?

I'm not pissed at you.

I am pissed at me.

I could still spin this
so the black board

of directors takes
the hit for this pinch.

Keeps me in play
with beltran.

You are to stand down!

You are either a lying hustler
or ineffective.

In any case, your involvement
with beltran is done!

[ indistinct conversations
in distance ]

i.c.e. Isn't gonna renege
on our deal?

Can't do it.

It's ironclad.

We'll go after beltran
and the missing powder.

She screwed this up.

This is her problem.

I made a deal
to bring in beltran

and the drugs for immunity.

I'm gonna hold
my end of it up.

Well, I'm part
of that deal, too.

We started this together.

Let's finish it together.

This young man needs to file
a report about his mother.

My mom's missing.

Since when?

Since last night.

She's gone,
and I need you to find her.

He killed her.

Rita's dead.

Billings:
we don't know that.

I wouldn't back off my hunch.

I had to get close to the mom,
and the little prick killed her!

Stop!

Tell me what's going on.

It's my fault!

Lloyd was the shooter
in that 2-11

when you and tina
were out on street duty.

Billings:
the more we talked to the kid,

the more the smash-and-grab
smelled like bullshit.

My take was that lloyd lured
the kid over to his house,

set the whole thing up.

Steve saw it, along
with the fbi profiler,

that lloyd
was a wrong number.

I thought that dutch boy might
have been onto something, maybe.

Lloyd's a budding
serial killer, and

the mom's victim number 2.

He's a kid.

By my lights, he looks like
he's worried sick about his mom.

That's what he learned
from murder number one --

Pretend like
you give a shit!

He's stepping up his game.

You really think he has it in
him to murder his own mother?

That's what he did.

We need to find mom.

You know
that's what I want, too.

I like your mom... a lot.

But the best way
you can help us

is to tell me
everything you rember,

try to retrace her steps.

When did you see her last?

Last night.

Late.

What time?

It was about 3:00 a.m.

She was in the living room,
crying.

It woke me up.

She said that she was upset
about a fight that you guys had.

She said
that she was going out

and that I should
go back to bed.

And then she took her car,
and she never came back.

Any idea... where she might have
gone to that late?

Your house.

She said that she was going
to see you.

Wagenbach:
I did see rita yesterday,

but it wasn't
in the middle of the night.

Steve, give us a minute.

I went over
to see if she was okay.

I got a bunch of hang-ups
from rita's cell yesterday.

I was worried about her.

A- ask danny.

Steve!

Dutch, you've got to tell me
all of it!

After I hit a wall
in the lloyd investigation,

I kept in touch with rita.

I figured,
staying in touch with her,

i'd be able
to keep an eye on lloyd,

prevent him
from hurting anyone else.

Please tell me
you didn't do anything stupid.

No! No.

She kissed me once,
but I-I stopped it there.

The point is,
when lloyd found out about it,

he was pissed --
Enough that

rita was scared.

When I talked to her
yesterday,

she didn't know anything
about those phone calls.

Lloyd made those calls
to get me to come over.

He killed her and --
And he made you a suspect.

[ woman speaking indistinctly
on police radio ]

you haven't
congratulated me yet.

Congratulations.

Do you even know for what?

I graduated the academy
a year ago.

oh.

Congratulations.

That's right.

Means I'm not a rookie anymore.

Guess not.

Maybe someone
will get me a cake.

What?

Sometimes other unis
get you a cake

when you hit
your one-year mark.

Eh, it's not important.

Huggins: if you want more thugs
selling drugs...

no!

no!

no!

no!

...or more hos on the stroll
along streets with potholes,

you do not want robert huggins
as your next mayor,

because I can't do
anything for you.

But if you want your parks
clean and green,

schools with more books
and less crooks,

then vote for me,
and I'll set you free.

Hey, give it up
for the man of god.

What did I say was
gonna -- what did I

say was gonna happen
if we had to respond

to one more noise
complaint at this address?

Keep it down!

Democracy --
Democracy ain't a quiet thing.

Hey! Turn that off!

Turn it off now!

Let me -- let me talk.

Hanlon: quiet!

Quiet!

I'm not talking about changing
the old ways. No, no.

Changing? That's nothing.

I'm talking about
destroying the old ways.

A political earthquake
where the old paradigm

is eradicated and we -- we...

we!

we!

we!

we!

...we start to build
the new from the nothing.

You're preaching
to the converted.

Right now, I just need for you
to shut this down

and clear the street.

Step into the truth-brary,
officer.

It's right there
in black and white.

It's right there.

You just need to see.

You're under arrest
for failure to disperse,

unlawful assembly.

Turn around, put your hands
behind your back.

Do you want
a resisting charge, too?

Man: william altamore.

Yeah, it's, uh,
it's shane vendrell.

Did they call?

Yes, I spoke
to captain wyms.

What did she say
about mara?

You turn yourself in today,
she'll discuss reduced charges

for your wife.

Reduced charges?

Like manslaughter?

I said no goddamn charges.

I tried.

She wouldn't go there.

There's no deal there
at the moment.

I- I don't know what
to tell you. Maybe you

should think about --
Yeah, okay, okay, thanks.

Thanks.

Mackey.

How you enjoying
your freedom?

Breathing deep.

Breathing easy.

Yeah, not for long.

You're about to get on your
horse and ride to our rescue.

Let me check my schedule,
there, shane.

Oh, sorry,
i'm booked through next weekend.

Do you think I'm joking,
shithead?

I'm in a jam, which means
we're both in a jam.

Not anymore.

I cut those strings, baby.

You and annie oakley
are officially on your own.

Bullshit.

Well, if it were bullshit,
i'd be pulling your ass

out of yet another
vendrell bear trap.

You chew your own
goddamn leg off from now on.

I don't think
you're listening to me.

I need something from you.

And you're not listening
to me, shane.

Ronnie and I
work for i.c.e. Now.

Yeah, I cut the deal
last night --

Full immunity for everything
all of us ever did.

I even used
your little black book

with all our dirty deeds
as a guide.

You forgot a few things.

You know that?

Bullshit.

'fraid not.

Trouble with you --
You're always trying

to be as smart as me.

Now I'm walking away clean,
and you're

the pathetic asshole
headed for

antwon mitchell-ville.

You know,
you always thought

you were
twice the family man I was.

Right?

The great dad, a loving,
misunderstood husband, right?

Your family loves you
so much, vic,

why'd they turn on you,
huh?

corrine's working
with the cops, buddy.

She answered one of our calls
and handed the phone over

to claudette,
who tried to get us to come in,

with you as the big catch.

You know that?

The mother of your children
has been playing you.

She would rather see you
go to prison

than to hug
one of your own kids again.

Whatever happens to me and mara,
at least we'll be together

for it.

Who you got, vic?

Tell me who you got.

When you and queen bitch
are serving your

mandatory life sentences apart,
i'm gonna check in on jackson

and this other kid
once a year

on their birthdays.

I'm gonna tell them
some good old stories

about ma and pa,
muss their hair,

take them out
for an ice cream.

You don't even get to look
at my kids!

Ever!

Do you understand that?!

Yeah, well, I'll send you
a postcard from space mountain.

you don't report
until tomorrow morning.

Where are my kids?

You shipped mine off
without talking to me.

When the beltran bust
went sideways,

we wanted them
out of harm's way.

Good.

When can I see them?

Corrine requested protection
from you, as well.

Corrine's been working
with cops?

Apparently, she's a better judge
of character than I am.

Beltran's still out there.

It's my job to take him down.

You are off beltran.

If I bring him
and the drugs in,

at least let me talk to corrine
so I can see my kids!

i...

I didn't get to say goodbye
to my children.

You said goodbye to them
the moment you shot another cop

in the face.

Be here 9:00 a.m. Sharp
tomorrow.

We're gonna find your mother
sooner or later.

Well, that's why I came
to you people.

No, lloyd, you came here
to implicate me

in her disappearance
because I know what you are.

Hey, my mom is missing,
and you're hassling me?

When you discovered that
your mom had feelings for me,

it scared you, made you mad,
because you knew

i'd be around more,
and, eventually,

i'd expose you.

You are obsessed
with trying to hurt me!

But my mom wouldn't let you.

If anything happens to her,
then you're the one

who's held responsible.

Detective,
I need to speak with you.

Wyms: you are not to talk
to that boy again.

What?

why?

Unis found this in a trash
container outside your house --

Burnt remnants
of women's clothing.

Someone set my trash can on fire
last night.

Neighbors saw you
milling around.

I went outside
to put it out.

Lloyd killed his mom,
put her clothes in my trash can,

and set it on fire.

You can't think
that I had anything to --

Of course not,
but I've got to protect the

integrity of this investigation.

You're not to go back
in that room with lloyd again.

I'm the one
who can break him.

No, steve's taking lead
on this. I'm sorry.

It's time for a new paradigm.

Vote for me, and I'll make sure
that happen for you --

Those of you non-felonious folk
who -- who still can vote.

All right, Mr. Huggins,
you're free to go.

Your homey just posted bail.

All right, now.

Come on.

Let's go.

Okay.

Man: go ahead, brother.

Represent.

Vote for me,
and I will set you free.

Robert huggins --
Remember that.

Robert huggins.

Mr. Huggins, I need
your signature right

here, please.

I'd like to make a formal
request for police protection

as is accorded
to all mayoral candidates,

such as david aceveda
and them other clowns

that don't even matter.

Protection for what?

Threats have been made
against my person.

Yeah, what kind of threats?

All kinds.

I mean, among them, cutting me
from my ass to my appetite --

Not my words,
but that's what they said.

Do you know who?

Anybody who's afraid
of the new paradigm.

hmm.

See, I threaten the
criminal/police codependency

that drives the
prison-industrial complex.

Hmm, do you, now?

Yes, little lady, I do.

I can have one of the detectives
take a report,

but, other than that, I'm...

Don't worry about it.

You know what?

I got something for you.

I'm counting on your vote.

Sure.

Woman:
excuse me, I'm looking for

detective holland wagenbach.

Uh, you found him.

Ellen carmichael,
steve billings' attorney.

The bitch dyke?

I'm sorry?

Uh, nothing.

Steve just described you
differently.

My head's in a case.

What can I do for you?

Well, detective billings
gave me your statement

regarding his injury,
and, frankly,

it isn't very helpful.

You're just now realizing
you're hip-deep in

a hummer lawsuit?

Steve said you were smart.

Flattery isn't gonna change
my perspective on this,

and, uh,
even though it's true,

we both know
steve didn't say that.

Could we talk specifics?

Now's not a good time.

Honestly,
I only need a few minutes.

If you can hang tight,
i'll try to fit you in.

Hey, it's steve's dime,
right?

Thank you, hon.

Excuse me, do you have, uh --
Do you have any roses?

I'm looking for a red one,
if you got it.

That's all we got.

All right, um,
i'll take some pens.

You old enough
to be working here, darlin'?

I'm 16.

Yeah? You look 14.

Well, dirty old man,
I've got the brain

of a 20-year-old.

What you studying?

A.p. Chem.

Ah, good.

You're gonna be
a college girl, huh?

Good for you.

Don't let the wrong guy
get his hooks into you there.

$17.29.

That's way too much.

Yeah, well, if you ever
get your nose out of a book,

you have yourself some fun.

Go to your apartment,
ma'am.

Hit it.

Hyah!

Drop it!

Where's beltran?!

Who? Ugh!

The byz lats were running
errands for pezuela.

Rest in peace.

So don't you tell me
that you didn't pay your

respects to the big boss man!

Okay, I won't tell you.

Ugh! Aah!

Don't!

Oh, no!

He didn't deliver his big
drug shipment to the blacks,

so that means you and your crew
are doing it for him.

Where is he?!

oh!

You'll kill him!

Hope your pet
had his shots.

Stop it! You're gonna kill him!

Stop it!

That's one way to go.

Where's beltran?!

Santi met some mexi big shot
last week

and made me wait in the car.

ohh!

Where?

Old kaplan warehouse
off figueroa.

You want him to live,
you better start sucking face.

Grab it.

Get a couple of unis
down here,

pop this asshole
for dealing kush.

Don't let him near a phone.

I got a 20 on beltran
and the drugs.

You think you can get over
your disgust for me long enough

to take down the cartel?

I am not stupid enough
to chase after another one

of your shadows,
whatever your agenda is.

I told you
i'm gonna deliver this guy.

That's what I'm doing.

You want in on the bust, fine.

If not, I got three other
fed agencies on my speed dial.

Do your thing.

Beltran's grunts are giving him
up to us as we speak.

Be on time
tomorrow morning.

so, as your mayor,

I will make
this neighborhood safer,

because I will add more
police officers to our streets.

Thank you.

Robert huggins,
man of god

and mayoral candidate
for the new paradigm party.

Vote for me,
and I will set you free...

'cause it's time
for a new paradigm, people.

Uh, sir, do you --
Do you have a question?

Don't you think putting
more police on the street

will only make a bad situation
a worse situation?

No, I don't.

The negativity of activity
of a police uniformed army

using intimidation,
deadly force, and whirly-copters

only gives
the criminally inclined

the permission to do
what it is they do.

We have to disagree on that.

But I-I will say this --
That law enforcement can only do

its job in partnership...

With each and every one of you.

We have to work together.

Robert huggins,
new paradigm party.

Vote for me,
and I'll set you free.

He's speaking
of a partnership,

yet, when asked to be included
in tonight's town meeting,

I was included out.

Seems to me you're doing
a pretty good job

of getting
your two cents heard anyway.

Kid's a brick wall.

Every time I drill in on him,
he does an end run,

right back to dutch,
who he seems to have

a very keen understanding of,
by the way.

Do we think there's a chance
the mother's still alive?

She could have gone away
for a spa weekend somewhere,

for all we know.

Rita's dead,
and I'm the reason why.

Just give me
one more shot at him.

With the allegations against you
and the forensic evidence,

any half-wit lawyer could get
this confession thrown out,

and you know it.

Then tell me
how we're gonna get this kid.

How many people
do I have to talk to

before you find my mother?

I'm captain wyms.

All the detectives here
are under my command,

including
detective wagenbach,

who you are saying
is responsible

for your mother's
disappearance?

I want to thank you
for coming forward.

Wagenbach has a history
of getting personally involved

with cases.

So I am taking what
you're saying very seriously.

Do you have any idea
what he did to her?

Some of your mother's clothes
were found in a trash can

outside his house.

They matched the clothing
she was wearing

the last time you saw her.

Did he kill her?

There's no murder
without a body.

I want you to tell me
about the relationship

between your mother
and wagenbach.

That's a great question.

First of all, we need to keep
gang members in the classroom

so that they can get
an education.

Right.

Right.

And then we need to provide
economic opportunities,

jobs, training,
mentor programs.

Let's try this.

Y'all can try this at home.

You got quarters
in your pocket?

Mr. Huggins...

If you want to hear what
the world sounds like

to Mr. Ass-is-veda...

No, don't laugh,
don't laugh.

It's not funny.

If you want to hear what
the world sounds like

to Mr. Ass-is-veda,
it's the sound of money.

It makes you deaf.

Amen.

That's aceveda.

And I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

I can't hear you.

See, the prison-industrial
complex

needs us to be gangbangers
and dope dealers,

or it will go broke.

You know that.

Officers, can you, uh, escort
this gentleman out?

I'm going, I'm going.

I'm all right.

But, see, what Mr. Brown bossman
and them don't tell you is,

they're selling our incarcerated
brothers to out-of-state prisons

for a profit.

See, they don't tell you that.

Sound like slavery, don't it?

Take it easy, sir.

Sound like slavery to you?

Take it easy, Mr. Huggins.

Sounds like slavery to me.

Vote for me,
and I will set you free!

Zip it.

Zip it now.

Singers, sing my song,
sing my song, sing my song.

Oh, let the old ways end
so I said...

Steve's under the impression
that you were doing

him a solid by
writing this statement.

He asked me for a favor.

I obliged him with the truth.

Yeah, well, as I read,
it seems pretty clear

you think he was faking
his injury.

Show me where it says that.

All you have to do
is read between the lines.

Listen, I'm very close to making
this city's countersuit

against my guy go away.

But if I turn this over
to the other side,

which I'm obligated to do
under the rules of discovery,

they're gonna drag us
into court.

And this is my problem how?

It's not.

But a jury trial
is nasty and expensive.

Steve could lose his job,
his pension.

He could burn through
his savings.

Now, is that what you really
want to see happen?

Basically,
steve's not a bad guy,

but there is no way I'm
gonna let him fleece the city

over a bump
on the noggin.

I can get him
to drop his claim.

But if the city attorney sees
this turd in sheep's clothing,

they're gonna go after my guy
full speed ahead,

and that's gonna be
on you.

This was
more of a rough draft.

What's the minimum
I have to say

to keep steve
getting a paycheck?

Hey, kim.

hi.

Sewell: "...through the forest
on his horse,

galloping full speed
to save the princess."

"far off in the distance,
he saw the dark tower

rising through the mist."
Jackson:

mommy, are you okay?

I'm fine, baby.

Just listen.

"as the knight got closer,
"he saw the tower was

even taller than he thought.

"it stood like a black fist,
punching through the clouds

and disappearing into the sky."
"he could hear faint sounds

of the princess crying."
Why was she crying?

She was scared.

Of what?

Scared that she would be
trapped there... forever.

Do you think I'm gonna marry
a princess?

You have to listen, honey.

Family meeting!

Captain, one of shane's
neighbors has called 911.

Said she saw him.

Wyms: where?

Walking into his apartment.

Claims he's there inside now.

Aceveda: mackey?

Why are you calling me?

I thought olivia
was your new go-to girl.

She burned me again --
Second time today.

I guess it didn't take i.c.e.

Too long
to figure out that they have

a reptile on the payroll.

Hey, hey, hey, what was that
moist little speech you made

about us respecting
each other's end games?

We both want beltran's people
out of business.

I've got the place,
and the time is right now.

Then do it yourself.

I thought you'd want to be there
for the press conference,

reach out to your voters.

What do you expect me
to do?

Go over olivia's head
to chaffee,

tell him to move
on the intel I gave them,

or lax federal drug enforcement
will be the topic

of your next press conference.

Where are we?

Up there.

Wyms: any sign?

Lowe: we've stayed clear.

No movement in the window.

No sound coming out of there.

Do you want
to call in s.w.a.t.?

No, if the wife and kids
are in there,

it's automatically
a hostage situation.

He doesn't know we're here.

We go in?

He had a chance to shoot me,
and he didn't.

I think
he's gonna go down easy.

We should vest up anyway.

I.c.e. Isn't coming.

Aceveda's been all over chaffee
by now.

No way he will Miss out
on his moment in the sun.

Beltran and his guys
could take off anytime,

and once they're
on the road...

Vic: no way of knowing
who else is inside.

Without backup...

That's some real
cowboy shit, man.

Yee-haw.

[ mid-tempo latin music plays
in distance ]

[ indistinct conversation
in distance ]

looks like
more than two guys.

Shit.

All right,
we're gonna have to split up.

You're gonna have to
distract them.

I'm gonna take beltran.

I'm that way.

[ conversation and music
continue ]

qu? Pas?

Qu? Es eso?

En la vida,
yo ya no te vuelvo a ver

yo te juro que...

aah!

You! Hands up!

W? tchele.

Gardocki: vic!

Any closer,
and his head's a pi? ata!

Let him go!

Ronnie, you good?!

Yeah.

Where are the drugs?

No drugs!

Don't die on me yet,
bitch.

Where are the drugs?

Man: if someone has a shot,
take it.

Federal agents!

Freeze!

Put your hands on your head!

Put your hands on your head!

Drop your weapon!

Take it!

Call an ambulance.

We can't make an arrest
without the narcotics.

Where the hell are they?

Man: don't move. You.

We're really getting
our money's worth with you guys.

Yeah! Whoo!

Agent murray!

Back here!

Look at this.

The whole thing.

Seize it.

Sweet!

Arrest beltran.

Let's count this up.

Whoo!

What a score!

Jackpot! Whoo!

All right!

The department has finally
agreed to settle.

I knew if I held out
long enough and strong enough,

the bastards would blink.

Oh. I guess congratulations
are in order.

How'd you make out,
steve?

Well, part of the deal is
a confidentiality agreement.

The department can't have
egg on their face.

But let's just say
that I am sittin' pretty.

Good for you.

Sorry if the rest of us
don't feel like celebrating.

Can I have a cup?

Black?

Sounds like you got some sort
of payday after all.

How do you figure?

Commission on steve's
settlement, however modest.

Oh, you mean the back pay
for the two days he missed

when he was injured?

That's all he got.

There was
no confidentiality clause.

Did he really call me
a bitch dyke?

In the nicest possible way.

He hit on me once.

I took a pass.

I guess he made
an assumption.

Here's my card.

Call me sometime
if you need anything.

Thanks.

I don't think I'm gonna be suing
the city anytime soon.

Probably not, but...

At least you'll know
how to find me.

Oh, looks like someone's
been working on their game.

Yeah? What game?

See, that's
what I'm talking about.

That's fantastic.

Well done, guys, well done.

Well, let's see,
it all started

when I was approached with
an offer for campaign money.

So, you've been a part
of the actual investigation?

I have been leading it
undercover

for several months, yes.

And you still find time
to run for mayor.

Well, uh, if you want
something done...

Pretty good work today.

Yeah.

You okay?

'cause that went pretty well
in there.

Ronnie, I just
got off the phone with wyms.

She needs you
back at the barn.

The uni here
will give you a lift.

What's up?

Don't know.

Sounded urgent.

All right.

I'll see you later.

Wyms needs to see you, too.

It must have been hard when
dutch came into the picture.

It'd been you and your mom
for so long.

No, what was hard
was when he started

telling her lies about me
so he could have her

all to himself.

Why don't you stop
telling lies, lloyd?

My mom wasn't interested
in him, okay?

But he wouldn't
leave her alone.

I mean, he came over to
the house yesterday to see her.

You can ask the neighbors.

Dutch didn't lay a finger
on your mother.

He burned her clothes.

We've got a witness
that clears him.

who?

me.

I'm a character witness.

I understand that man
better than anyone,

and I know
he didn't do this.

Well, sometimes people
don't know each other

as well as they think.

You mean like your mother
didn't know you?

Didn't know what she'd been
raising the last 16 years?

Well, I know you.

I've been doing this
for 31 years,

and I've interrogated liars
and cheats,

murders and psychopaths.

I've even interviewed
a few innocent people.

And when I listen to you,
I hear an evil,

narcissistic young man
who knows

his mother is dead...

And knows exactly how
her life ended.

It is my responsibility
to inform you

that you are now a suspect
in the disappearance and

possible murder of rita denton.

I can't talk to you anymore,
because you're a minor

and you need a lawyer present.

But we'll get one down here
in the morning.

Until then,
you're a guest of the county.

You were in there
a long time.

You all right?

It's a matter of time.

Before what?

Before lloyd breaks.

If we can just outlast him...

We'll get to the truth.

He loves his mother,
no matter what he did to her.

All sons do.

It's an emotional killing,
but, eventually, everything

will come spilling out.

There's nobody better at this
than you.

Not even me.

Where are those new meds?

Let me get them for you.

In here?

Dutch.

Uh...

There are no new meds.

They don't work anymore.

Tried them all.

And the side effects
were affecting my job

performance anyway.

Well, they must be able
to give you something.

They've got all kinds
of new dru--

I'm dying.

This is what it looks like.

It's...

It's slow, but it's moving
in one direction.

Okay, l-let's not go there.

Well, no, not today.

But sooner than later...

This is the disease
that's gonna kill me.

This is... an emotional backlash
to shane.

The world's just screwed up
today.

All I have to do...

Is deal with this pain
every day.

And every day that I can,
i'll show up...

Until the day that I don't.

What can I do?

Tell me.

You just keep doing
what friends do.

It means a lot.

Watch the curb.

Two gunshot wounds --
One to the chest,

one to the abdomen.

He's touch-and-go.

I'll ride with him,
see if I can get a statement.

Good luck.

Lowe: hey, get these
people back.

Set up a perimeter.

Step back, sir.

One, two, three.

Robert, who did this?

Big -- big staxx.

Big staxx. Acorn park.

why?

I organized a picket line
around his rock house.

Crackheads
didn't want to cross.

Crackheads? Wow.

That's big-time, robert.

That's big.

New paradigm.

New paradigm.

Yeah.

ohh!

I got your vote?

Yeah.

I got your --
Yeah, robert.

Look. See?

You see? You see that?

You got my vote, robert.

Get the paddles.

Ronnie.

hey.

I got to talk to you, man.

So you heard...

About shane?

No. What?

He killed himself.

What?

At his place.

Gun to his head
when the cops came in.

Oh, jesus christ.

And, vic...

He took jackson and mara
with him.

I don't know.

The whole thing
is just so shitty.

At least we're clear now.

Finally clear
of all the shit

that they were holding
over our heads.

I never thought
we would be.

We don't even need
i.c.e.'s immunity now.

Ronnie --
Vic, I need to ask

some questions about
the vendrell case.

Could we switch seats,
please?

Excuse me?

This ismyseat.

That's yours.

You heard about shane,
what he did

to his pregnant wife,
to his young son.

He wrote a note.

"i guess enough painkillers
can make even the worst kind

"of hurt go away.

"the thing you need to know
is that mara was innocent,

"and jackson was innocent.

"they didn't know
what they were drinking,

"and their last moments together
were happy ones.

"they left the way
I first found them --

"perfect and innocent.

"they were innocent,
and they're in heaven now,

"and we'll always be
a family.

"the guilty ones
are me and vic.

"vic led,
but I kept following.

"i don't think one's worse
than the other,

"but we made each other
into something worse

"than our
individual selves.

"i wish I'd never met him.

"i see it all now.

"there's no apologies
I can make,

"no explanations
I can give.

"i was who I was, and I can't be
that person anymore.

I can't let myself..."
We think this is

where he was
when we came in,

because it stops there.

All those busts...

All those confessions
you got in this room,

illegal or otherwise,
all the drugs you got off

the street tonight for i.c.e.

You must be very proud
of yourself.

This is what the "hero" left
on his way out the door.

Dutch.

You can bill me for it.

Fine.

First payment's due now.

Ronnie!

Ronald everett gardocki,
you're under arrest.

For what?

The last three years,
the armenian

money train robbery,
covering up

terry crowley's murder.

Mackey gave the feds
everything.

Already got himself
full immunity.

Not you, though.

What?

You told themallof it?

Ronnie.

You made a deal
for yourself

and you're sendingme
to prison?

I'm -- I'm sorry. My family --
I- I thought corrine --

You're goddamned sorry?!

Wagenbach: process him.

Take him in.

I didn't think
I had a choice.

What about
my goddamn choice?!

Where was my goddamn choice?!

I was going to run!

We were gonna run together!

God damn it!

What about the team?!

What about protecting
the goddamn team?!

You can go now.

Where are my kids?

Commencement paperwork
will be ready for you to sign

by the end of the day.

Where's my family?

As soon as they're situated
in their new location,

i'll let you know
they're safe.

Tapped into an old c.i.

Of mine last night.

I got some reliable intel
about a vietnamese crew

trying to make a move
on the tweeny trade.

You won't be needing
your c.i.s.

Won't be needing
a weapon, either.

You get it out of this building,
or you put it in a lockbox.

This is my personal.

I assumed you'd be issuing --
You don't get it.

You're not on the street for us.

Where am I then?

These are summaries of recent
gang-related activity

in the greater
los angeles area.

tom?

We need you to review these,
look for patterns,

and offer analysis
by way of memo,

at least 10 pages,
single-spaced.

I'll need the first report
by 6:00 tonight.

This is not
what I signed up for.

Me either.

I don't do desks!

Fine.

Then you violated
your agreement,

and you'll be prosecuted
for everything you confessed to.

Read the terms
of your immunity deal.

Mandatory drug tests
once a week,

five written reports
a week.

Unfortunately,
it's only for three years,

but I'm gonna see you feel
everysingle day of it.

Let me talk to corrine.

You can't --
I got to see my kids.

It's suit-and-tie here.

Lunch hour,
go home and change.

These rumors circulating
that I had anything to do

with this crackpot
candidate's death --

That's how it goes.

You know, in the hood, rumors
take on a life of their own.

But I cannot ignore
a bomb threat

to your campaign headquarters
no matter how far-fetched.

The worst part is
this huggins fellow

apparently saw it coming.

He asked tina for
police protection yesterday

before he got shot.

How you holding up?

Got complaints.

There's no need to share.

Wouldn't have anything to do
with the man who got away?

You know, webothspent a lot
of time and energy

in this room
trying to put that man away.

I caught
your press conference.

Congratulations.

You're gonna be the mayor.

Well, there's the little matter
of the election.

I'm sure
that won't stop you.

This is the kitchen.

We ask people
who bring in their lunches

to label them
so there will be no confusion.

The lights
and air-conditioning

will shut off automatically
at 6:00 p.m. --

Unless you call
extension 863

and let them know
that you're working late.

Under no circumstances should
you adjust the thermostat.

If you want to change
the temperature,

it really
has to be authorized

by a maintenance
supervisor.

Here we are.

If you need anything,
you can always reach me

in human resources,
extension 912.

I'm gonna leave your key card
on the desk.

Okay. Here.

I'll get that for you.

Isn't particularly, um...

And inside, it's just
not a whole lot better.

It's pretty basic,
but, well, it's quiet,

and the schools
are getting better.

The district grades out
pretty well,

particularly the programs
for autistic children.

There's an ice rink
a couple miles away.

And guess what?

There is a museum here
with an actual dinosaur.

Hmm? The largest and finest
juvenile t-rex in the world

is right here at the fabulous
burpee museum.

Her name is jane.

There's parks nearby,
the shopping, mostly on the --

Stop. Stop.

It's, um -- it's perfect.

Have you, uh,
thought about the nickname

you'd like us to call you?

Your legacy?

Detective --
Without one,

it's easy to be forgotten.

You ever heard the name
mack ray edwards?

see?

Edwards worked for the county,
helped build

the los angeles freeways.

From 1953 to 1969,
he slaughtered children

at night,
planted their bodies in the soil

that he and his fellow workers
would pave over with asphalt

the next day.

The city's roads were literally
paved with dead bodies.

50% of the world's
known serial killers

have spent at least a portion
of their lives

in southern california.

Why doyouthink that is?

Well, it's 'cause everyone
comes to los angeles

to get famous.

Get ready
for your close-up, lloyd.

[ laughter,
indistinct conversations ]

out of the academy
for one year.

I made it.

I made it.

Good job.

2-11 in progress.

Shots have been fired.

Come on --
Broadway and lennox.

Downtown officers
need help.
