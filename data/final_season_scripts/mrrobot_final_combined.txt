You work for the Dark Army now.

It was you who exported the keys.

You could make it like Five/Nine never happened.

Whatever happens after this, I want us to keep talking.

I want us to be a team.

My associates found your pet employee.

I am your father.

Angela Moss was allowed to continue with her lawsuit, which put my plant in jeopardy.

You're panicking right now.

The minute you remove emotion from this, you'll do just fine.

You need to talk to Angela.

She is not doing well.

Last time I saw her, she was going through a full-on breakdown.

The cyber bombing, that was my fault.

She used me for that.

I have to believe that there was a purpose.

[STIRRING MUSIC.]

Pettiness.

[SOBS.]

It was a dig at me.

It's that small, unfortunately.

No, it's not over.

It's not over.

It can't be.

[SOBS.]

She was gonna bring my mom back.

[RAGGED SOBS.]

We were gonna be reunited.

[SOBBING.]

What are you gonna do to her?

What are you asking?

Retribution I want it.

I'm afraid your only move here: accept that you've been conned.

Find a way to live with what you did.

No.

You're wrong about her project.

I know it's possible.

I've seen it.

And I know how to take it from her.

Don't you get it?

With everything that we know, this is what we have to do.

- Shut up.

- We can expose her.

We can tell everyone what she showed me.

Shut up!

[WHISPERING.]

Sh-shut up.

No, I won't.

And if you're not gonna help me, I'm gonna do it on my own.

And there is nothing you can do or say to stop me.

[BIRDS CHIRPING.]

I wish you hadn't said that.

You have to understand.

I have been trying to stop her from hurting you.

That's that's why I brought you here.

But you ta you talk like this, and I cannot protect you.

You have to relent.

There's a chance, if if you if you beg.

It's the only way out of this, please, please, please.

Shh.

You're panicking right now.

Remove all emotion, and you'll do just fine.

Isn't that what you're good at?

It wasn't without a valiant attempt on your part, though, trying to talk some sense into her.

It isn't your fault that she wouldn't listen.

You didn't give me enough time.

She She could have she could she could she could have come around.

I meant everything I said to her.

You are psychotic.

You're certainly not mincing words today, are you?

It's all psychotic.

I've become very good at it over the years, don't you think?

Our team has an update on the shipment hack we obtained from Mr.

It appears it will grant us the clearance we need by the end of the year.

It's October now, so that's two more months we'll have to wait.

Just in time for the holidays.

What is it?

Mr.

Alderson is a good-for-nothing wretch that is not to be trusted.

Oh, Wang Shu, you needn't worry.

Once our project ships, he'll have served his purpose and then he can be terminated.

In the meantime, he needs to be kept on a short leash and trained not to bite his master.

Very well, then.

Not long ago, we were talking about an economic collapse on par with the Great Depression.

Especially hard to believe given the November jobs report that was released on Friday.

Over 400,000 jobs were added.

This really shows the resilience of E Corp and their CEO, Tyrell Wellick.

If it weren't for their data recovery and their Ecoin loan program, we wouldn't be enjoying the turnaround we're experiencing right now.

I'm serious.

I'm not afraid to use this if I have to.

And then that video will not only be automatically sent to the FBI but to your wife and kids.

Is that something you're afraid of?

Sit down.

Give me the drive.

So we're square, right?

You gonna erase that video?

I can't have anyone seeing that.

You understand me, man?

I'm trusting that your word is good?

Do you know who those guys were, the ones who were following me?

What the f*ck were those guys doing following me?

They want to know who you're giving these files to.

Why?

Because they're protecting one of your clients.

What client?

Whiterose.

What the f*ck are you talking about, man?

Who's that?

You know her as Zhi Zhang, the Chinese minister of state security.

He and his partners have been using shell corporations to move money around, and your name keeps popping up on all their company filings.

Oh, sh*t.

You were wrong.

We found their heart.

We rob it she finally goes down.

What am I not seeing?

This used to be about saving the world.

You're making it too personal.

You're making this about what they did to Angela.

You're letting your feelings cloud your judgment.

My feelings?

See what's going on out there?

People are already forgetting about Five/Nine, the cyber bombings.

They're buying their Ecoin discounted stocking stuffers and Christmas hams, and they're gonna forget.

And I don't blame them.

They're exhausted.

I'm exhausted.

But we let this go, it'll be back to business as usual for Whiterose and her friends.

Okay, I-I-I-I tried to catch up with her, but it was it was crowded and I lost her, but okay, but this is proof, right?

This is proof.

Maybe this is why they never found her body.

Maybe she's still alive.

That's not possible.

No, I am telling you I saw her.

She was on the street, same red cart, same bathrobe, exactly the way we saw her in that security footage before she got into that van.

- Darlene.

- Maybe she escaped.

I swear I saw her.

Maybe if you would just help me, we could find her together; we just need to canvass - all of the homeless shelters.

- This has to stop.

Elliot, we can't give up on her, okay?

We can't.

You did a little too much coke and you saw something that wasn't there.

I will show you where I saw her.

I know we don't usually do this, but I have to fill you in if he won't.

That's why you're back, isn't it, to help?

You gotta be noticing it, then, too, that he's not talking to you.

He doesn't talk to me that much either, not since Angela died.

Darlene's right.

He's shutting down, compartmentalizing the pain, living in the distraction, just like the holidays: the fake Santas, the plastic trees, the annoying Christmas carols ALL: O come, all ye faithful One big song-and-dance production to sell ourselves the theater that everything's jolly, at least for a moment.

But when it's all over, Santa's gone back to his shitty day job.

The trees get disassembled and thrown in a closet.

The music's faded away.

What then?

That's why you can't go anywhere.

I know he's keeping you away, but I'll let you in.

Don't think I'm doing it for you, though.

Let's be clear.

I still don't give a sh*t about you, but he does.

This does not feel right to me.

E Corp owns the building.

I forget how frightened people can be of them the first time.

I'm a taxidermist.

Uh, I wasn't frightened, just a little unexpected is all.

Taxidermy, huh?

Guess you were into stuffed animals as a kid?

[CHUCKLES.]

Not particularly, no.

Well, um, it was nice meeting you, Janice.

And, uh, I'm sorry about all this.

All what?

I think my mom was trying to, you know set us up.

Oh, my, I had no Oh!

[LAUGHS.]

I [LAUGHS.]

Oh, this is this is terribly awkward.

Uh, I-I-I-I think she might have gotten the wrong idea.

It's all good.

I'm on a self-imposed time-out anyway.

Okay.

My ma, she's just trying to cheer me up.

She thought this would help.

Yeah, she said you'd been through kind of a rough patch.

Bet she did.

Um It's not a big deal.

It's just a promotion at work has been a lot of stress is all.

Yeah, she said you haven't been sleeping, and she told me about the drinking, mm.

Oh, I hope I'm not speaking out of school.

I-I-I just meant to say I've been there with work, you know.

Long hours can really burn you out, especially in my field.

But I'm here to talk, if you want.

Sometimes that can help.

Yeah.

Anyway, I should get to bed.

Good night, Janice.

Yeah, that's a good idea.

You need your rest.

After all, you have that interview about the Santiago case in the morning.

[OMINOUS MUSIC.]

Excuse me?

You've put it off for weeks.

It's starting to look suspicious.

What did you say?

I was just explaining that unless you go to work tomorrow and finish cleaning up Santiago's mess, then I'm gonna be forced to do something very bad to your mother, like, really bad, you know?

Like, I'm probably gonna have to slit her from mouth to c**t.

You touch my mom, I will strangle you to death.

You understand me?

[LAUGHS SOFTLY.]

Oh, you can strangle me till the cows come home.

That's not gonna stop the rest of 'em.

Now, you get that rest we talked about.

You got a big day tomorrow.

Oh, and would you thank your mom for me for the macaroni?

[CAR DOOR SLAMS.]

[ENGINE TURNING OVER.]

Real life, yo.

I'm just saying, the skullduggery of scientists led us to this point in believing this bullshit.

What bullshit, exactly?

That the Earth is a sphere when it so clearly is flat.

[LAUGHS.]

See, you ain't even willing to question it.

That's how they get you.

If the Earth's flat, then how come no one's ever fallen off the side?

Easy answer: Antarctica.

Whoever lives here has to be f*cking mental.

Dar.

[LAUGHS.]

What's up?

I just got here.

[CHUCKLES SOFTLY.]

Please tell me you have something stronger.

Hmm, stronger than what?

Anything I've already taken.

[LAUGHS.]

That's what's up.

I got you.

sh*t, girl, you didn't even let me tell you what it was.

Why the f*ck is someone in Angela's bedroom?

Who's Angela?

Oh, Prada, YSL, ChloÃ©, ballet shoes, and a bunch of fish food with no f*cking fish.

Smells like some "American Psycho" sh*t's going on here.



Get the f*ck out of here, you f*cking Mary Poppins whore!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

The f*ck did you give me?

Babe, you need to chill.

- f*ck you.

- What?

Get out.

Get out.

Get the f*ck out right now!

She won't be able to move sh*t.

[NEEDLE CAP CLATTERS.]

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Hold on a second.

Listen to me.

The people you work for, they're t*rrorists.

They don't care about you or any of us.

I know you don't want to do this.

You're just getting paid to.

Please, I can't leave like this.

I've hurt so many people.

[BREATHING HEAVILY.]

I have to make this right.

[SYRINGE SLURPS.]

Wait.

Wait.

No.

You tell her if I die, this won't be over.

I know all about Cyprus National Bank.

Her money's as good as gone.

Even if I die [GRUNTS.]

She's gonna pay for what she's done.

[SHOUTING.]

Do you hear me?

You tell that piece of sh*t that my anger won't die with me and she can't hide from what's coming for her!

You hear me?

You hear me?

Hmm.

Welcome back, Mr. Alderson
Unless you go to work tomorrow, I'm gonna be forced to do something very bad to your mother.

Give me your phone.

I rigged Signal's API to beam GPS coords so we can share locations.

My whole life is ruined because of you.

All you deserve is pure and utter agony.

Olivia was Susan Jacobs' contact.

She's an addict.

If she gets caught using, she loses her kid.

I'm not like most people.

I'm starting to pick up on that.

My mom got k*lled.

m*rder*d, actually.

Olivia's access isn't good enough.

You know why we came back here, right?

So you could be king of New York.

And in order for our kingdom to be built, I need a brilliant architect.

- I'm trying to help him.

- You're trying to destroy me.

I'm done talking to you.

One of your patients hacked me.

- Krista.

- I don't feel safe around you.

She knows something I gotta know.

It's time we talked.

I'm gonna tell you a story.

A story of a true "Xmas" miracle.

This is the tale of a bully and a little b*tch.

I'm talking about a mean, nasty bully and a scrawny-a*s little b*tch.

This bully would pick on the little b*tch every day after school.

If little b*tch had cash, little b*tch got robbed.

If little b*tch bowed up, little b*tch got stomped.

Point I'm trying to make here is, this bully owned that b*tch like a Lincoln Continental, but something happened to change it all.



On this Xmas of our tale, little b*tch got lucky with the gifts, see?

Something little b*tch loved more than anything before family, God, and country was baseball.

Loved the sh*t out of it.

Well, on this Xmas morning when he got out of his little bedroom and looked under his little tree, guess what he found.

An Easton Magnum aluminum baseball bat.

Little b*tch grabbed that bat and went right outside to play.

Didn't even take the bow off, he was so excited.

And there he was on the corner ball field, hitting ba*ls like he was Sammy Sosa when his bully comes up, eyeing that bat.

And just as the bully made his way up to him, without any warning bam!

Blood.

Fuckin' everywhere.

Blood on the ground, blood on little b*tch, blood dripping down the bow still wrapped around that bat.

Little b*tch knocked every tooth out of that m*therf*cker's head.



Cracked his skull open, popped his eyeball out on home plate.

All because little b*tch saw the truth.

That bat may have been made to play ball, but that wasn't its purpose.

Nuh-uh.

In that moment in little b*tch's hands, it was there to break this n*gga's head open.

See, Ms.

Krista, we all have a purpose in this world, and it's our lot in life to wait for the cosmos to reveal what that is.

But you don't have to look no more 'Cause for you, that day has come.

Want to know why?

I'm gonna break Elliot and you gonna be my aluminum bat.

I'm, uh I'm on my way to Olivia's now.

How are we gonna get to her boss?

We still need his login credentials to transfer the money.

Don't worry about it.

I have a plan.

Did the proxy hack at Virtual Realty check out?

Yeah, we're good.

I'm seeing all the unencrypted network traffic.

What about the venue for this Deus Group shindig?

Do we know where it's going down?

Uh, Price sent me the location.

It should be in your inbox.

There's a hotel across the street that we should work out of.

Are you there?

Darlene?

Yeah.

The other day, when I said that I should never have let you back in my life I was an as*h*le.

I'm sorry.

You still have my Signal mod running on your phone, right?

Yeah, why?

Just be careful, okay?

Keep your phone on you so I can see where you are.

I don't want to lose you again.

Oh, thank you.

I I got to go.

Elli.

Ah, long time no see, cuz.

Where do I know this place from?

Do you have it?

Of course I got it, bro.

Under the table.

Where you going?

I got to go.

Damn, you just gon' leave like that?

Thought we gonna catch up.

Sorry, man, I I got sh*t to do.

Listen, just so you know, I'm full-time freelance now.

Only loyalty is to the almighty paper.

So hang on to my number.

Should you need anything, you know I'm your guy.

You be strange, now, but don't be a stranger, know what I mean?

Peace, Elli.

We don't have to do this.

We can find a way to talk to her.

And if she says no?

Then we reason with her.

And if she still says no?

We don't have time for taking risks.

This is the only way.

Hey.

What you're about to do is crossing a line.

Well, it's a little late for that, don't you think?

He's right.

We used to have a code.

Lines we would not cross, parameters we set.

Those seem to have been seriously modified.

Question is, can we bring those boundaries back?

Or is it like he said, too late?

Two large peppermint mochas.

What were you doing in Pike's Hollow this morning?

How did you get in here?

Where's your brother?

Did you take him somewhere?

Is he still in the city?

Okay.

f*ck, Darlene, you should have kept driving.

Who are you calling?

You can't call this in to the FBI.

If the Dark Army finds out about that crime scene, they're gonna send someone They already did.

Have a seat.

A guy who continually talks to an invisible entity that isn't there Has arguments with him.

The invisible entity interrupts him sometimes.

- Clorox.

- Market.

- How may I help you?

- I have her.

Oh, well done.

And her brother?

No, and she's not giving him up.

Uh-huh.

Well, that's not great.

Keep her close.

Let me run it up the flagpole.

Call you back in a bit.

Return of a biblical prophet, Jan Matthys is preaching death and repentance before the Second Coming, and those who are not part of the chosen people Hello, sweetheart.

Are going to be horribly k*lled.

I brought peppermint mochas.

They said it was Christmas in a cup.

Well, it is indeed Christmas.

Very sweet.

Do you want to come in?

Yeah.

Okay.

What I'm about to tell you is gonna sound A little crazy.

What's up?

It's about your clients.

My clients?

At Cyprus National Bank.

I never told you where I work.

A bank that primarily does business with the Deus Group.

Whoa.

What the f*ck is this?

They're a criminal enterprise that uses their power and wealth to run the world without anyone knowing it.

Okay, I don't know why you're Tiananmen Square, civil w*r in the Congo, both Iraq wars, the paramilitary m*ssacre in El Salado The cyber bombings.

That's not even their top five.

Okay You're really starting to scare me.

Tell me what you're doing.

Why do you know where I work?

I hacked you.

Excuse me?

I hacked you.

Why?

I need you to do something for me.

What what is this?

I need you to make one phone call to your boss.

I'm already on their proxy server.

I just need him to log in so I can swipe his credentials.

I know this doesn't make sense to you right now, but trust me, Olivia they're using you.

They're using me?

They are, but I can stop them.

I can stop them once and for all.

All I need is one phone call from you.

Get out.

- Don't do this.

- Are you f*cking kidding me?

This conversation's over.

Get the f*ck out.

Now.

What happens if you fail a drug test?

What did you say?

I know about your custody battle.

If you test positive for Oxy What the f*ck are you talking about?

I'm eight years clean.

No, you're not.

You drugged me?

I had to make sure you would listen.

You're gonna call your boss in Cyprus.

You're gonna get him to log in to the bank website, and that's it.

Then I'm gone.

If you don't do what I say you lose your son.

Why are you doing this?

I was running out of time.

This was the fastest way to convince you.

This was taken one mile from where the van following Mr.

Alderson was found burned.

We have his sister, but we're still searching for him.

The minute we find him, I think You think what?

It's time, Minister Zhang.

He's too much of a liability.

Oh, you're being foolish.

If we k*ll him, his shipping hack dies with him.

We have the Deus Group meeting tonight.

Think about what you're saying.

The entire membership will be there.

It's too risky.

I will not get this close only to watch it slip away again.

I want you to locate Mr.

Alderson and bring him in.

He should see the full potential of what we're working towards.

It's time he learns we're on the same side.

- Placemat.

- Bandit.

How's everything over there?

- Fine.

- Good news and bad news.

The higher-ups want Elliot, not his sister.

I don't suppose she's mentioned where he is yet?

She wouldn't do that.

I heard her talking to him earlier, though.

We can get his location off her phone.

Oh, interesting.

And you have her phone, I assume.

Yeah, I got it right here, so we don't need her.

Fantastic.

Well, then, I'll be there with my team to collect the phone.

And her?

k*ll her.

What?

You said it yourself.

We don't need her.

Cleaner this way.

You can handle that, right?

Mm-hmm.

Because I recall the last time you didn't feel 100 No.

I'm fine.

I'm just saying, if you don't feel 100% like last time, you should let me know right now so I can set aside the time to k*ll your mother and your entire family.

No.

I can handle it.

Great.

I'll be there at 3:30 on the dot.

Make sure it's done by then.

What?

What did they say?

f*ck!

What the f*ck?

Wait!

Wait!

f*cking wait!

Get up!

What the f*ck are you doing?

Keeping my family safe.

On your knees!

So this is it, then?

They tell you to k*ll me, and you're just gonna do it?

Your phone gives them Elliot's location, so they don't need you.

This is crazy.

This isn't you, Dom!

You don't need to f*cking do this!

I can't believe you have the ba*ls to say that.

You ruined my life.

I did.

I'll own that, okay?

But that doesn't make you this!

You don't just f*cking shoot people in cold blood!

- I'm here because of you.

- I know.

- You did this to me!

- I know!

Okay, you were right.

Okay?

I was wrong.

Give me a chance to make it right.

I can get you out of this.

- There's no way out.

- I have a plan.

You think I give a sh*t about your plan?

We are gonna take down the Dark Army once and for all.

It's happening tonight.

It's too late.

Please, Dom, it's not too late.

No, it has to be like this.

There's not enough time.

It's too late.

- Dom, listen to me!

- They coming at 3:30.

Listen to me.

I know I f*cked up, okay?

But it's not too late.

If you let me go, I can stop this, okay?

I swear to God, if you just let me go.

- Please!

- I'm sorry.

No, no, no, please!

Don't be sorry, Dom.

Don't be, don't be!

Don't be sorry, Dom, okay?

Please, Dom, don't be sorry.

You don't need to do this.

You are a good person!

- This isn't you!

- Shut up!

sh*t, sh*t, sh*t.

sh*t.

How soon can he get back to me?

It's urgent, yes.

I know, but it's regarding Mr.

Kuklachev.

He'll want to know.

Okay, great.

Merry Christmas.

How long do you think it'll be?

f*ck you.

My life is over.

I want you to know that.

You just have to talk to him.

Then I'll go.

Nothing will be traced to you.

And you think that's it, huh?

You just drugged an addict.

You'll get through it.

You arrogant piece of sh*t.

Maybe you can have a slip and it's not the end of the world, but I can't.

It destroys me.

So f*ck you.

Maybe you should have thought about that before you worked for them.

What's that supposed to mean?

Offshore bank in Cyprus.

Kind of money that goes through there.

You know, come on.

You're not dumb.

I'm sure a part of you has always known.

You chose to look the other way.

My choices are none of your business.

I get it.

You needed a job.

They were paying well.

That's how they do it.

That's their business model.

They back everyone into a corner until all that's left is for us to compromise ourselves.

That's why what I'm doing has to be done.

They're hurting you just like they're hurting all of us.

The only one hurting me right now is you.

I wonder how many people you've had to hurt to get what you want.

Hmm?

How many has it been, Elliot?

How many people have had to suffer because of you?

Was it worth it?

I'm a mess.

Can I use the bathroom?

Yeah, go ahead.

So was f*cking me part of the plan, or was that just a happy accident?

It was an accident.

That's sweet.

It's almost done.

Once her boss calls back, we'll get what we need and go.

This would have all been simpler if she wasn't so deep in denial about who she's working for.

There it is.

That sense of dread.

It only happens when you cross a line you didn't even know existed.

Maybe that dread is a good thing.

After all, when you realize you've crossed a line That means you still had one.

When those crossed lines are all behind you, up ahead is only darkness.

He has insomnia, social anxiety.

I I don't know what else to tell you.

Morphine addiction, jail time, dead daddy.

You're giving me the knockoffs, girl.

I want the brand name.

Please let me go.

Whatever you're looking for, I don't have it.

I know the two of you had a special relationship.

"Special"?

He hacked me.

He threatened my last boyfriend.

He threatened me.

You know, I had to stop seeing him because he scared me so much.

You weren't scared of him!

You loved his a*s!

I saw the look on your face.

Don't lie to me.

This isn't going to work.

Your outbursts.

Discover more

Just because you were bullied as a kid, because people hurt you until that day you swung a bat and learned how to hurt them back doesn't mean it's going to work with me.

W-wait a minute.

Wait a f*cking second.

Miss Krista, are you are you calling me a little b*tch?

Yo, Peanuts.

You hear that, what she called me?

She called you a little b*tch.

Hey, Javi.

You hear her calling me a little b*tch?

That's what I heard.

See?

That's why you're good.

Not even my b*tch can call me a little b*tch.

Oh, my God!

- Who's that?

- Jason.

Jason, huh?

That your boy?

Maybe we should bring him in here.

Maybe that's what'll what'll get you going.

Hello, babe.

Are you in there?

How about that, Miss Krista?

We gon' have one big merry-merry.

I was able to stop the bleeding.

Gonna be okay.

I'm sorry.

I don't believe you.

You said the people I work for They were behind the m*ssacre in El Salado?

My mom died there.

I know.

Olivia I can stop them.

Hi.

Um, I'm sorry to bother you on a holiday, but Mr.

Kuklachev needs the authorization to transfer funds.

You don't see the request?

Are you sure?

I still don't see it.

Okay, that's strange.

He said it was urgent.

Maybe he changed his mind.

I'll just I'll just check back with him and and get back to you.

Okay, thanks.

Merry Christmas to you too.

I'll wipe all the traces of you and your boss's involvement.

Nothing will be linked back to you.

You know, I may work for monsters But you are one.

And you're the worst kind, because you don't even know it.

Oh, damn.

Your boy's upset you didn't let him in.

Ah, all right.

Now before your boy came and went, you were calling me a little b*tch?

Chill, girl.

I didn't take no offense.

In fact, this was my bad, 'cause I didn't tell you the whole story.

See, I was just explaining your role to you.

That you my bat.

But that bat ain't the end of the story.

Nah.

That's where I come in.

So after being beaten within an inch of his life by that badass little b*tch, the bully woke up in the hospital.

It was right then when little b*tch walked in like the f*cking ghost of Xmas past.

Bully sees him and starts crying.

I mean, this n*gga was scared.

He must have thought that boy had come to finish him off.

But you know what happened?

Little b*tch just walked right up to his bully's bed And held his hand.

Yep.

He held his hand Just like so.

Real soft and gentle-like.

And then he got real close.

He looks at his bully, all sniffling and crying.

He looked at him and said "I see you now.

" Little b*tch showed up when no one else would.

He saw his bully like no one else could and that was all it took.

And, Miss Krista, from that moment on, he owned that bully for life.



Now, if I want to own Elliot, I don't just gotta break him.

Me and Elliot are linked on a spiritual plane.

I got to come at him on the same level I find myself, and and breaking him only gets you so far.

I gotta break him so I can build him up.

I need to wound his soul so I can be the one to heal him.

That is how you own a n*gga.

Now, the next words out of your mouth have to be exactly what I want.

Not for my sake, but for yours and for your boy Jason, who lives up on 1404 Jay Street.

Now, you know what I want.

You got to give it to me.

You do that, I got no reason not to turn you loose.

Look me in my eye.

Trust me.

Go to the filing cabinet in my office.

There's a folder in the bottom drawer.

Go to the tab that says "September 2015.

" Look for Elliot's name.

What am I gonna find there?

Mr.

Robot.

What's that?

That is how you'll break him.

Oh, my head hurts.

I thought you were gonna k*ll me.

They gave me an hour.

How long has it been?

Just unlock your phone.

All they want is Elliot's location.

- I can't.

- You can.

What would you do if it was your family?

I'm doing it.

You know that night we spent together?

I know you probably think of it as the worst night of your life The night all this sh*t went to sh*t.

But when I think about it, it was Don't.

Nice.

The last time I remember actually feeling good.

You were just using me.

You know it was more than that.

Look whatever you have to do, I get it.

Okay?

But just just at least believe that.

I'm out of time.

Get up.

- Where are we going?

- Come on, get up.

- Where are we going?

- Up.

Come on, let's go.

You got the jump on me, and before I knew what was happening, it was over.

What are you talking about?

Take it and make it quick.

- You want me to shoot you?

- It's the only way.

Come on, we're running out of time.

You have to k*ll me.

I'm not f*cking k*lling you, okay?

Let's go.

We can make a run for it.

If they show up and we're gone, my family's dead.

Don't you get it?

My life puts everyone I love in danger.

This won't stop until I'm dead.

I'm not gonna f*cking k*ll you.

I'd do it myself if I could.

I've thought about it every day for the past two months, but I can't do it.

I can't do it.

Please, Darlene, just pull the f*cking trigger.

- I can't.

- Just pull the f*cking trigger!

- Dom, please.

- Pull the f*cking trigger!

- I can't.

- Do it!

Dominique?

Well, now, I was not expecting this.

I I'm stunned.

I I don't know what to say.

My goodness.

Oh.

Oh, don't worry, I'm not gonna k*ll you.

You are still far too useful to us for that.

But this is going to be so painful for you.

Now, where's the phone?

I want you to understand, I mean you no ill will.

My instructions were to find your brother.

Well, in that case, my phone's not gonna do you any good.

I just wiped it.

Huh.

Shouldn't we be talking about what just happened?

We got the access we needed to transfer the money from the bank's side.

Once we hack all of the members' phones tonight at their meeting, we can rob them blind.

That's not what I meant.

What you meant doesn't matter.

- Krista?

- Elliot, I need to see you.

I'm actually kind of busy.

Can I call you tomorrow?

I was kidnapped by someone you know.

Fernando Vera.

He wanted to know everything about you, everything I knew.

I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do.

I didn't have a choice.

He had a g*n.

Once he got what he wanted, he let me go.

I went to the police, but now I'm too afraid to go back home.

- I'm scared.

- Wait, wait, slow down.

- Where are you right now?

- I'm-I don't know.

Downtown, I think.

I can meet you at Washington Square Park.

- Can you get there?

- I think so.

- I'll see you soon.

- Okay.

There's no way he's just gonna let her go.

I know.

Here we go again, off to play the hero.

But is that even who we are anymore?

You saw what we did back there.

We just watched him destroy someone's life and none of us did a thing about it.

Rules, morals, parameters they only break if you're broken to begin with.



Did we change under pressure, or did this only reveal who we really are?

I don't know anymore.

- The one thing I do know is - Hey, hey!

Wait, wait, wait!

Help!

Hey!

Hey, hey!

We're all waiting for you at the beach.

We're ready to take the wedding party photo.

How far away are you?

I'm still at my apartment.

Your apartment?

What are you doing there?

It's gonna take you forever to get to Coney Island.

I'll be right there.

[SINGING IN FRENCH]

I was wondering if you were gonna show up.

Wherever you go, I go.

Remember?

There's a lot to fill you in on.

I can see that.

I'm in a hurry, though.

Let's talk on the way, okay?

On the way to what, exactly?

My wedding.

I didn't think it was possible.

But Whiterose's machine, somehow it worked.

She was right.

We're in a world where everything's better.

Not for him.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

If you're here to tell me what I did was wrong Not anymore.

You need to start seeing that for yourself.

You don't understand.

I had to Had to what?

This is the only strategy for us.

Strategy?

So, what, you're just gonna take his place?

Is that what this is?

It's not that easy.

Why not?

I look exactly like him.

Trust me when I tell you this.

You are not him.

I don't have time to explain this to you.

You need to stop.

No.

I'm not letting you steal this from me.

Just who exactly do you think the thief is here?

I'm running late.

I gotta get going.

You know this can't happen.

If you don't want to help me, then get the f*ck out of my way.

Unfortunately, I can't let you get away with this.

You've been parked in this fire lane for quite a while.

I'm gonna have to give you a ticket.

I'm moving it right now.

I'm gonna have to see some ID first.

Is this your vehicle?

Yeah.

Then I'm gonna need that ID.

[EERIE MUSIC]

Sir, what is this?

I asked for your ID.

That's my ID.

Sir, this ID belongs to Elliot Alderson.

Yeah.

That's me.

This person is nothing like you.

What's in the box?

Uh, I'm moving.

In a tuxedo?

I'm headed to my wedding.

Which is it, you're moving, or you're headed to your wedding?

Okay, sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to open the box for me.

I'm really sorry.

I just really need to get to my wedding.

You can't stop this.

I'm going to marry Angela.

Nothing else matters.

Think about what you're saying.

Angela is dead.

Not in this world.

That's not Angela.

I talked to her!

No, you didn't.

I thought things were fine between us.

But it's still the same you, isn't it?

You just don't want me to be happy, do you?

Why can't you just let me have this one thing?

Elliot, you need to listen to me.

No!

I don't!

Not anymore.

I'm done listening to you.

I just want to be f*cking alone.

That's all I've ever really wanted from you.

Where's Angela?

[SIGHS]

She's not coming.

Why not?

There was never gonna be a wedding, Elliot.

That's what I've been trying to tell you.

No, you don't understand.

Whiterose's machine created this.

- That's why we're here.

- No, it didn't.

You were right about her game.

It deactivated the machine, just like you thought it would.

This is a world you created.

[SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC]

I created?

I tried to bring you back here a while ago.

I've been here before?

You accidentally slipped into it once when you were going through your morphine withdrawal.

So this is some kind of dream?

No.

Not a dream.

A prison.

A recursive loop that you constructed about a year ago to keep him occupied so you could take control of him.

Who?

[SIGHS]

The real Elliot.

The real Elliot?

The f*ck are you talking about?

You think the guy that was back at my apartment was the real Elliot?

As real as he could be in this deluded fantasy that you stuck him in.

I'm the real Elliot Alderson.

You're no more Elliot Alderson than I am.

You're just like me, only a part of him.

And if you don't let go, he'll never get back to living his own life.

What life?

I k*lled him, remember?

You can't k*ll him no matter how hard you try.

This doesn't make any f*cking sense.

If I'm not Elliot Who the f*ck am I?

[BREATHING SHAKILY]

Hello, Elliot.

What is this?

What am I doing here?

You don't recognize this place?

This is your office.

But you're not really Krista.

No.

Of course not.

But since you trusted Krista so much, the others thought it would be better if she spoke to you.

Why would I trust any of you?

You've been trying to k*ll me.

We've been trying to show you the truth, and you've been resisting.

Not this again.

I can't talk to you.

I need to talk to Darlene.

She's not here.

Where is she?

She's out there in the real world.

But I heard her voice.

Yes.

She's trying to wake you.

Elliot's connection to her is quite strong.

So strong, she's become his only link to reality.

In fact, it was by design she was removed from this fantasy.

Without Darlene, it was your best chance at trapping him here.

I'm not listening to this.

[SOFT WHOOSHING]

Listen to me.

I don't want to be in this nightmare anymore.

I want to wake up.

I want my life back!

[SOFT WHOOSHING]

I understand why you're confused.

[SOFT WHOOSHING]

I can explain everything if you let me.

In order for you to fully hear the truth, first we need to discuss Elliot's dissociative identity disorder.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

The first personality was created the day Elliot jumped out the window [GLASS SHATTERS]

You're just sick and don't want to admit it.

[WHEEZES]

Shh.

The movie's about to start.

The protector personality The one Elliot created to replace his father To protect him from intolerable situations All I was trying to do was take those punches for you.

Thank you.

Mr. Robot.

[TRAIN RUMBLING]

Later in life, Elliot created the mother personality The persecutor Get up!

Blaming Elliot for the abuse I hate you.

You're nothing.

You're worthless.

Insisting that he needed to pay for it.

He was weak, and you're just as weak as him.

Not long after her came Elliot's younger self [TRAIN RUMBLING]

Who emerged to handle the abuse he couldn't tolerate.



And with that he'd created his own family of sorts.

We're deep down inside you, Elliot.

You can't leave us, and we can't leave you.

I guess she doesn't know about you.

I know all about them too, the voyeurs who think they aren't a part of this despite being here for all of it.

And for a while, we thought we had identified all of Elliot's personalities.

But there's another one.

who came about not too long ago.

I don't want to hear this again.

The truth about who you are?

I think it's time.

Even they agree with me.

I know where you're going with this.

It's not true.

It's okay.

I know why you did it.

Your heart was in the right place.

You wanted to shelter him, which is why you changed his past.

I want you to tell me about your father.

Kept shoving me away, shoving me so hard, I fell backwards out the window.

I wasn't changing anything.

That's What I thought happened.

But it was his future you really wanted to protect, wasn't it?

Get out of here right now, or I'll call the Police?



You want them to find out about the 100 terabytes of child pornography?

That's why you went to such great lengths to take down all the evil that surrounded him in the real world.

So you formed fsociety.

Hello, Evil Corp.

We are fsociety.

Why did you do it?

You loved him so much, you wanted to save the entire world so you could make it better for him, no matter the cost.

That's why you hid him here, turning his harsh reality into a fantasy I can't wait to marry you tomorrow.



Trapping him in an endless loop I'm stuck in a repetitive, boring routine.

To keep him safe until you were ready.

I don't remember any of this.

Why should I trust you?

You've been wrong before.

You're right.

She was wrong.

Krista never quite figured it out, did she?

She never realized she wasn't talking to the real Elliot.

[UNSETTLING MUSIC]

She didn't realize she was always talking to you.

Elliot, what's wrong?

Nothing.

You're hiding again.

The personality created to carry Elliot's rage f*ck society.

I was angry.

I hated myself.

Angela's dead.

She's f*cking dead.

And we need to work on your anger issues, Elliot.

Shut up!

The personality that had gained so much control There's something inside me that can't let go of what we started.

He forgot.

They all think I'm the ringleader.

[SNORTS]

Oh, my God, Elliot.

Did you forget again?

Something is going on with you, Elliot.

You have not been the same the past couple of months.

He forgot he was only just another personality.

- Elliot?

- No.

The other one.

Are you Elliot Alderson?

How do I take off a mask when it stops being a mask?

- Is this you or - It's me.

Sometimes my mask takes over.

He sometimes can become a different person.

See me, Elliot Alderson.

I am here.

I'm the only one that exists.

You're not Elliot.

- You're - The mastermind.

And now it's time for you to give that control back to the host The real Elliot.

No!

[TENSE MUSIC]

Don't do this.

[RUMBLING]

I don't ever have to give up control.

This isn't your control.

This isn't a dream, Elliot.

You're here, right?

I am right here.

I promise.

[EXHALES HEAVILY]

Nurse should be here any second.

I thought I'd never see you again.

I thought I lost you too.

No way.

I'm not going anywhere.

Well, you sure make it f*cking hard to believe that sometimes.

Do you remember what happened when you are at the power plant?



They said you somehow stopped a meltdown, but there was still an expl*si*n.

The only way you survived was because the room you were in had some sort of advanced shielding.

They found Whiterose's body.

She's officially dead, along with that machine Angela said she was hiding.

When you cut the power supply, it malfunctioned and blew up.

It was under the rubble, totally pulverized.

Guess it's official.

You saved the world, Elliot Alderson.

I don't think I can do this.

Do what?

Darlene Who I am It isn't real.

Elliot.

Look at me.

You remember my promise to you.

As long as I was here for you, as long as you could hold my hand, then you would know that this is real.

And I am telling you, this is real.

I was there with you through all of it: fsociety, our hack on E Corp, Five/Nine, you going to prison, the cyber bombings, us robbing those evil m*therf*ckers after what they did to Angela.

Angela, she's gone.

Same with Romero, Trenton, Mobley, Shayla.

Elliot, I wouldn't lie to you.

This isn't in your head.

This is real.

But I'm not.

What are you talking about?

Of course you are real.

You are right here.

I'm not him.

Darlene I'm not Elliot.

[SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC]

I'm only a part of him.

[SIGHS]

I know.

I know you're not him.

Not the Elliot I grew up with, at least.

I've known since we started fsociety.

You don't act like him.

At first, I thought maybe it was you but different.

But then when you forgot who I was again, it wasn't hard to figure it out from there.

How come you never said anything?

I don't know.

We were hanging out.

We were spending time together.

It felt like we were finally getting close.

I guess I didn't want that to stop.

How come you two weren't close before?

What did he do?

He didn't do anything.

[SNIFFLES]

It was me.

I wasn't there for him.

I didn't know how to talk to him.

[SNIFFLES]

I couldn't deal with what he was going through, so I gave up and took off.

[SNIFFLES]

That was part of the reason why I came back.

I wanted to fix things.

But he was gone, and you were here instead.

[SNIFFLES]

Is he is he okay?

I made a safe place for him.

It's got everything he ever wanted.

Good.

He deserves that.

You know, even though I bailed on him, there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about him.

I really miss him.

Uh, I'm gonna go get the nurse.

[SOFT WHOOSHING]

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

Hello, friend.

God, that's always been lame, hasn't it?

Sorry I never came up with a better name for you.

Then again, I don't even have a name.

Just a guy trying to play God without permission.

You told me once that this would be a black void, absolute nothingness.

Is that true?

We'll always be part of him, kiddo.

This whole time, I thought changing the world was something you did, an act you performed, something you fought for.

I don't know if that's true anymore.

What if changing the world was just about being here, by showing up no matter how many times we get told we don't belong, by staying true even when we're shamed into being false, by believing in ourselves even when we're told we're too different?

And if we all held on to that, if we refuse to budge and fall in line, if we stood our ground for long enough, just maybe The world can't help but change around us.

Even though we'll be gone, it's like Mr.

Robot said.

We'll always be a part of Elliot Alderson.

And we'll be the best part, because we're the part that always showed up.

We're the part that stayed.

We're the part that changed him.

And who wouldn't be proud of that?
