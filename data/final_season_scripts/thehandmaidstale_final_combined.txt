( grunts )
( bones crunch )
( gasps )
( tires squealing ) Luke: Stop! Stop! What the fսck are you doing?
Nick: Gilead wants her to suffer.
They won't stop. So I need to know that you'll protect her.
I look forward to working together.
Nick: Hey!
( groans )
Blaine!
You could've fսck¡n' killed her!
You will never let go of her, will you?
I tried, but I can't.
( gasps ) Who do you think you are?
Mrs. Fredrick Waterford.
To me, you are just a whοre.
( alarm sounding )
( Noah crying )
Please, stop! Stop, stop!
The man from the truck, died.
They could get a signed warrant for Luke at any minute.
We have to run.
This country is changing.
Mark: American refugees are on their way here.
We're putting them on trains to go west.
I can get you on one.
Luke: Go ahead.
June: What? No!
If they recognize me, they're gonna stop you and Nichole. So just go.
June, we're gonna find each other. We always do. You were never gonna get on the train, were you?
( whistles ) Mr. Bankole, you are under arrest.
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.
( Nichole crying )
We're gonna find some place. Okay?
( Noah crying ) Hi, June.
Hi, Serena.
( Noah crying )
( shushing )
( Nichole babbling )
Hey. You've got your shoes?
You've got your shoes there. Good girl. Good girl.
Here comes Mommy. Here comes Mommy.
Mommies always come back. Yeah.
Yes. Here she is. Oh, there we go.
Serena: Come here, my love.	Gift baskets
( groans )
( exhales )
Okay.
Should we go sit over here, honey? Come on.
You wanna sit up there?
Serena: Thank you.
June: Well, okay.
Hi, are you hungry?
I'm sorry, there was a long line at the rest room.
It's a pleasure. Seriously.
I, um... I haven't been able to put him down... in days, it feels like.
There just hasn't been anybody else to hold him.
But now we're safe, we can rest.
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna get some sleep 'cause I'm fսck¡ng exhausted, and my arm is fսck¡ng killing me.
Right, of course. Sorry.
Um, your arm is broken. It must be quite painful.
How did you break it?
( clicks tongue ) Um... a car accident.
A car ran over me in front of my house.
Pardon? When?
Yesterday.
I'm sorry, a car ran over you yesterday?
Yeah. Yesterday morning.
It was a truck. It was not a car.
Always look both ways.
( Noah cries )
Well, you are, uh... ( clears throat ) one exceptionally tough woman.
Thank you.
It was Gilead.
They tried to kill me.
It seems they are unhappy with both of us.
( scoffs )
Well, we're not the same, but...
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
On a case-by-case basis.
Well, now you can put all of that behind you.
( clicks tongue ) From your mouth to God's ears, Serena.
Well, he's been smiling on us so far, since... since we've been on the run.
Why do you make it sound romantic?
That is unintentional. I don't think there's anything romantic about being absolutely terrified all of the time.
And by tonight, Toronto and the Wheelers will be 1,000 miles away.
And Gilead will be 1,000 miles away, too.
Tomorrow, we can start to forget.
( exhales )
( breathing unsteadily ) Sweetie. Nichole? sh¡t, sh¡t, sh¡t, sh¡t.
Sweetie, Nichole? Excuse me. Excuse me.
Nichole... honey? Nichole, sweetie? Excuse me. man: Yeah, no problem.
sh¡t, sh¡t, sh¡t, sh¡t.
June: Nichole? Honey?
Hi!
Excuse me.
Hi, sweetheart. Hi!
Did you wake up?
Ah, she did. You were still sleeping.
( Nichole babbling ) June: Come here, sweetie-pie.
I've got you.
Come here, come here. There we go.
There we go. Okay, sweetie.
Don't you ever do that again.
I was concerned that you might be ill-tempered if you didn't get enough rest.
Silly me.
Just keep your fսck¡ng hands off my kid!
Do you understand me?
Okay. Yes, I understand you.
What, you think I'm going to steal your daughter?
While you're sleeping, like some kind of Disney villain?
For God's sake, June, that's completely idiotic.
( breathing heavily )
( exhales )
Are you all right? You look flushed.
I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just... it's hot in here.
Don't touch me!
Okay. All right, well, I gave her a rice cake out of your diaper bag, I hope that's okay.
I'm sure that you expected a poisoned apple.
She's still hungry, though.
Is there any other food?	Groceries
I'm afraid the cupboard is bare, but they did pass these out.
Praise be.
Don't say that in here. Someone may hear you.
Okay.
Where did all these people come from?
We passed through Winnipeg about six hours ago, and they added a lot more cars, a lot more people.
There's no fսck¡ng service.
Are you all right?
( sighs ) No. Okay, let's go, uh...
Come on, sweetie. We're gonna go get some more food.
All right, honey. Okay.
And where is there to go, June?
I mean, you realize we're on a moving train, right?
There has to be an NGO... somewhere.
And they're gonna have food, and maybe a satellite phone 'cause I need to talk to my husband.
Okay.
No, no, you stay here.
You have to agree it makes sense for us to stick together.
Serena, we are not together, okay?
Excuse me, do you know if there's an NGO car or anything like that?
Oh, I don't know. They said there was food that way if we wanted.
Car six, whatever that means.
Thank you.
I don't think you can make it through, though.
( Nichole crying )
Okay, sweetie, we're just gonna get some food, okay?
You're all right. You're okay.
( exhales ) ( sound distorts ) Okay.
( June exhales )
( whispering ) Hey, hey, hey, hey. Are you okay?
Don't touch me, okay?
You're sick.
Get... just... hands off me!
Okay.
( Nichole fussing )
All right. Why don't you stay right here?
( groans ) woman: Is she okay? ( train whistle blowing )
...get you a clean one.
I promise.
Serena: Excuse me.
All right?
Serena: Right here.
I got you a doctor.
What?
Hello. What's going on?
Jesus Christ.
I, um... Look, do you have a working phone?
Let's make a deal. You let me treat you, and then you can call whomever you want.
Fine.
Dr. Brandt: What happened here?
I broke it.
Ah, it looks like you had...
( groans ) ...some recent surgical repair?
Yes, she did.
Maybe your friend could take your daughter for a moment.
Yes!
No.
Dr. Brandt: Uh, you've probably torn a few sutures.
I need to have a look under there. I'll be quick.
Of course, I'm happy to.
( Nichole babbling )
Fine. Fine.
Okay. Mommy's right here, okay?
Yeah. Okay.
Come here. Hi.
( Nichole babbling )
Maybe you could find her a clean diaper or something?
Yes, relax, June. I'm not going anywhere.
Dr. Brandt: Looks like you have a nice infection boiling in here.
Yeah, see, this is why mothers and children should be cared for.
We are the most important people on the train.
You should see Dr. Brandt next.
Oh, okay. Thank you.
( winces )
Dr. Brandt: All right.
( Nichole babbling ) Hey.
( seabirds calling )
( cuffs clicking )
Guardian: Sir, High Commander Wharton's been waiting for you.
Blessed day.
Morning, sir.
It's a nice surprise.
Well, I thought we should celebrate your freedom.
Nick: She's, uh... right to be upset with me.
Well, Rosie's always been sensitive.
But you two have a lifetime together to figure that out.
What happens between a man and wife is between them and God.
I know I need to, uh... talk to Commander Lawrence.
Yes, you do.
I wasn't thinking straight.
Lost my head.
I'll try and smooth it over with him.
Look, I can't say I blame you.
Who amongst us hasn't been tempted?
But don't you think maybe it's time to put away those childish things?
No matter how fun and diverting they may be? Prioritize?
Prioritize what's best for you and your family?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, I sound like a fortune cookie.
All of that is to say, Nick, you have a bright future.
It's yours, if you take it.
Thank you, sir.
I knew you'd understand.
I'm gonna go to the club, see if I can catch Lawrence on the back nine. Plead your case a little.
But I'll see you at home tonight.
You're, uh, not going back to D.C.?
No, I think they can get by without me... for a while.
I want to spend some time close to Rose.
I have a grandson on the way.
Priorities, remember? fսck.
( babies fussing )
Serena: Could you move those suitcases out of the way there?
Lauren: Excuse me, guys.
Excuse me.
Lauren: Can you make a little room? We could use some space.
Beg your grace. I hope you can understand, we just need a space of our own. Thanks.
Yeah.
man: Yeah, I'll grab my bag there. C'mon, guys.
Here, please. Come in. Much better.
See, now we have a space for women and children.
Did you call Luke?
No. I talked to my friend, Moira.
Well, any news? What's going on with your husband?
He's been arrested, okay?
( Nichole fussing )
June: Come on, honey. Let's go.
( June exhales )
( exhales ) Hi, sweetie. How you doing?
Let's get some juice, huh?
There we go.
Luke is in jail.
He was arrested for defending me.
The man who ran me over died.
God's justice will prevail.
Luke will find you in Vancouver.
Gilead won't matter, and your family will be together again.
Serena.
Hannah.
Hannah. She's still there. Remember?
She was kidnapped, and she's still a prisoner.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I misspoke.
Please forgive me.
Okay.
Moira said that we're not going to Vancouver.
They're overwhelmed, and they won't let the train come in.
All right.
Then where are we going?
( sighs ) She doesn't know yet.
So I... ( sighs ) I don't know.
But I know my husband won't be there.
By His hand, you will find a way to bring your family back together, June, that is your gift.
If it is at all possible, you will find a way.
I don't know if I can be alone again.
Then we will find a way. I will help you.
( scoffs )
I don't want your help.
I know you don't want my help. I realize that.
And you don't have to accept it, and I understand that, too. But...
God would want me to help.
I need to... after everything. Okay. ( indistinct distant chatter )
Mark: That's not good.
Confirm with Colonel Ochoa, and send it first thing. Make it happen. man: Will do.
Moira: I'm not going to wait for an appointment.
I got footage from every doorbell camera on the street.
Luke was protecting June, he fought the guy off in self-defense.
Mark: Okay.
Um, I'll make the calls, do what I can.
Oh, yeah?
How I say that to 100 refugees every day when I know I can't do a thing.
It's not a good time to be an American in Canada.
No? That's news.
No... they're, uh...
( sighs ) getting ready to shut this place down.
This entire office could be gone in a year.
What? ( stutters ) How can they do that?
The Cabinet wants to start normalizing relations with Gilead.
That would mean de-recognizing the United States.
( scoffs )
Moira: We can't just let them win.
Mark: Our military's depleted... no match.
So that's it?
We're done fighting back?
( Moira scoffs )
Mayday's fighting back.
I thought you didn't work with Mayday.
We don't have many friends left.
You find your allies where you can.
I wanna help.
I need to help.
I mean, you must need people to cross the border, get inside.
sh¡t, all that black market sh¡t I saw when I was at Jezebel's, it's... it's got to come in somehow.
What... you were... you were at Jezebel's?
No one leaves Jezebel's.
How'd you get out?
I killed a Commander.
Well...
That's something.
Amy: They sent me to Martha school.
Yeah, it didn't take.
They kicked me around, and then sent me to an agricultural colony.
So I ate, at least.
Was liberated at the border last month.
God's grace was on you.
Amy: It wasn't God, we had a really smart doctor who gave a sh¡t.
Well, I'm sure that was God's grace as well.
I was in a Jezebel's for 17 months, ma'am.
God is just an excuse for men to use two things, cocks and guns.
Beatrice: I haven't seen my Chandra since she was two.
I'm out, but my baby girl is still there.
It feels like a piece of your body is gone.
They aren't gone. If they were gone, it would be easier.
No.
No. That's not true.
Serena: Well, I'm so sorry.
It seems like all of us here, at some point or another, were a part of some kind of violence.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah.
My daughter, Hannah, was captured in the forest.
The Guardians ran us off the road, and they chased us down.
Hannah was so scared.
And I was terrified.
That's awful.
We were only half a mile from the border.
I just couldn't... I couldn't run fast enough.
Don't say that.
They were soldiers.
I'm her mom.
And when they, uh, caught me, I was holding her, and they pulled her away.
They were pulling her, and I...
I let go.
I let her go.
May God heal you.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
I wish that helped.
How are you feeling?
Much better, thanks.
Dr. Brandt: Can I take a look?
Okay, sweetie. Come on.
( groans )
How well do you know your traveling companion?
Um, we've known each other a while.
Not too long, I'd hope.
No, not too long.
I don't think she is who you think she is.
Well, she's... she's a refugee.
If you knew who she was, you wouldn't be letting her anywhere near your daughter.
I think she's a war criminal traveling under false papers.
They'll make sure when they arrest her.
I talked to the security people.
They're sending an officer to come and get her.
When?
I think they're on their way.
It's what she deserves.
It's better than she deserves.
Just promise me one thing, okay?
Promise me that we will keep her baby safe.
All right?
( Noah fussing )
Dr. Brandt: And how are we doing?
Serena: I think very well, thank you.
Dr. Brandt: Let me take a look at that young man.
There we go. Oh, there we go. ( shushing )
( Noah fussing )
( Dr. Brandt chuckles )
They're so precious, you know?
( Dr. Brandt chuckles ) And he seems like a very healthy young boy.
It's okay.
Praise be for that, right?
( clears throat ) But tell me about his father.
Oh, um, he died in the war.
Dr. Brandt: May his memory be a blessing.
You know, in Gilead, I worked mostly in fertility sciences.
And it was all men, of course, in the lab.
It was odd.
And you certainly remembered when there was a woman around.
I never forgot.
I imagine. Um, I think he needs a diaper change, actually.
( Noah fussing )
Almost done here.
And Commanders would visit the lab all the time.
( shushes )
Sometimes, rarely actually, they would bring their wives... when they were interested.
Sometimes they asked... the most intelligent questions.
( Noah fussing )
Please give me my son.
Doctor, I think he misses his mommy.
He's really... a beautiful boy, Mrs. Waterford.
Serena Joy.
woman: No fսck¡ng way.
Amy: My God, it's her.
fսck¡ng Serena Joy. How did you get on here?
Beatrice: I bet she has fake papers.
Lauren: She was detained in Toronto.
woman: That's her.
Yes. I was in Toronto.
I left Gilead because I wanted freedom for my son.
Amy: Who cares?
You built the fսck¡ng place. It belongs to you.
You're the rat that doesn't get to jump off the ship.
You're the rat that sinks!
Wait, wait. No, no, calm down.
Amy: Don't tell me to calm down.
Just...
woman: That fսck¡ng b¡tch!
You're gonna calm down. man: You brainwashed?
Okay?
woman: She doesn't deserve to be here.
man: She stole our children! woman 1: She's a criminal!
woman 2: Who does she think she is?
The police are coming.
They're going to arrest her.
I reported her to the DCBS...
What?
They're sending an officer.
He should be on his way.
No!
No, please do not report me! Do not give me over to the police!
You are getting off easy.
If... June, if I'm arrested in Canada, they will... they'll give Noah back to the Wheelers, and I'll never see him again.
June, please, help me.
How can you be so fսck¡ng blind sometimes?
woman: fսck¡ng help you?
Amy: She isn't blind.
But she should be.
June: Hey.
Stop it.
We can cut out her tongue.
Great idea. woman: Yeah.
Amy: Let's see it, Mrs. Waterford.
Enough.
They took her finger, all right?
She spoke out, and they took her finger.
She has paid, okay?
woman: How can you defend her?
Beatrice: She threw people off fսck¡ng rooftops.
Gender traitors?
How do you pay for that?
Before Gilead, America was full of horrors.
Serena, shut up.
Women were getting raped, and killed every day, and nobody cared. And that was your country. woman: What is wrong with you?
Serena: You were unfit. I am not responsible for your tragedies! woman: You stole our children!
Your children were not taken from you!
They weren't stolen, they were saved!
man: Shut up! Serena, shut up! woman: She's a rapіst!
Serena: God hated America because America turned their back on God.
And God took your country away. God blessed America!
Serena!
woman: She should burn in hell!
Officer. The police will keep you safe, safer than you deserve.
officer: That's her?
Yes, officer.
Serena Joy Waterford.
I believe there's a warrant for her arrest.
Do you have papers?
Lauren: They're all fake. woman 1: She's a criminal! woman 2: She's a traitor to women!
( women murmuring )
Yeah, okay. These seem legit. ( indistinct disbelieving chatter ) June: No.
Sorry to bother you.
No, no. Sir? Sir? No, officer? Sir? Listen to me.
This is Serena Waterford. Okay?
Serena: Stop it.
Stop it.
Trust me. Trust me.
Shut up.
This is Serena Waterford.
I know because she was my mistress...
June.
...in Gilead.
Jesus fսck¡ng Christ. She raped you.
And you have to arrest her. Okay?
Please, sir. You have to take her and the baby out of here.
All right? This is her.
You have to arrest her.
Just trust me, Serena. woman: What's wrong with her?
You have a beautiful baby, ma'am.
Thank you.
I had a son. And a wife.
She died in The Colonies.
( breath trembling ) He'd be almost 11.
You look nothing like Serena Joy.
Sorry for the interruption, ladies.
June: No, officer. Sir? Officer!
Officer? Uh... uh...
Sir? Sir?
If anyone wants to leave, they should go.
Okay. Okay. Come on. Come through. Come through. It's okay.
Let's go. Let's go. Back away from me. woman: You're disgusting!
June?
woman: They'll never get out.
Don't come any closer to my baby! Get away from me! June!
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Back off. It's okay.
This is not going to bring you any peace.
You should leave. woman: Get out of the way.
No. man: Get her.
( Serena grunts )
( Noah crying ) Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Don't do this. Don't do this.
Beatrice: She doesn't deserve to have a baby. woman: Rot in hell.
( grunts ) Please don't. Please don't touch me! Please! ( indistinct shouting )
Please don't touch me. ( crying )
Serena. Give me the baby.
Please, stop.
( grunts )
Please, please! Please, I have a baby. woman: A fսck¡ng monster!
Give me the baby.
( Serena gasps ) Give me Noah.
June! June!
June: Give me the baby, Serena.
I'm just taking the baby. Please let me take the baby.
( indistinct shouting ) June!
( Noah wailing ) ( all shouting indistinctly ) Stop!
( shouting continues )
( breathing heavily )
( brakes screech )
( all screaming )
( screeching )
( breathing heavily )
( Noah crying ) Come on. Go.
( shouting continues )
( shouting continues )
( crying )
Come on, come on. Serena, you have to jump. woman: Open the door!
Serena?
Serena: Oh, my God.
( shouting continues )
( banging on door )
Where am I gonna go?
Serena, you have to jump.
I can't get off the train. Serena, yes you can. sh¡t. woman: Break the glass!
I can't.
( train whistle blows )
There's nowhere to go.
They're gonna hurt Noah.
Listen to me, Serena! You have to get off the train. Okay?
( brakes hiss )
( grunts ) ( train whistle blows )
June, I can't do it.
Go.
( train whistle blows )
( shouting continues )
( shouting continues )
Amy: fսck! She's gone.
You fսck¡ng traitor!
( gasps )
( exhales sharply, breathing deeply )
( lock clicks )
( breathing heavily ) ( door unlocks, opens ) railroad worker: Hey, wake up!
It's Alaska! End of the line.

First, we kill the Commanders at Jezebel's. We're gonna do a dry run.
We know exactly when the penthouse will be empty.
I'll go.
          NAOMI It's not just golf and cocktail parties anymore.
The High Commanders derive their sense of power from their virility.
She was yours once, wasn't she? I'll let you have her this time.
What did you think was gonna happen to me?
With your history? Either a slow death in The Colonies or a quick one on the wall.
I knew you had something to live for.
What did you say to Ellen?
Janine, she's at Jezebel's and I need to go see her.
I'm going to Jezebel's. So you can either come with me or you can not go at all.
You want to go in. You want to fight.
But I built this plan from the ground up.
I'm gonna deliver my bombs to the locations I picked.
This is my chance to fight for Hannah.
I was told you'd be rewarded for your service.
They lied to you.
I will get you out of this terrible place.
          WHARTON I saw you a few years ago at one of the balls in D.C.
You were dancing and had this glow.
I'd never seen such beauty and grace.
I prayed for God's forgiveness that night for coveting another man's wife.
          AUNT LYDIA Mrs. Waterford.
Aunt Lydia?
Blessed evening.

( gunshot )
What are you gonna do about those Guardians?
I'll take care of it.
I get it. If you have to go in, then go in with me.
If you wanna fight, then let's fight together.
♪ Walk in silence ♪
♪ Don't walk away in silence ♪
♪ See the danger ♪
♪ Always danger ♪
♪ Endless talking ♪
♪ Life rebuilding ♪
♪ Don't walk away ♪ Busy day?
Yeah. 26 families reunited, more coming this week.
So far, so good.
Those people expect to be safe here, son, as they were promised.
Their security is my top priority.
And what about the incident in No Man's Land, so close to the border?
Two Guardians shot, left for dead.
I'm way ahead of you. I've already opened an investigation.
That was an alarming breach of security, son.
On your watch.
You need to hold these terrorist rebels accountable.
Here's the problem.
No eyewitnesses. One victim dead, the other's in a coma.
He's not expected to recover. So...
Actually, that young man has shown remarkable signs of improvement.
Call it divine providence.
That's great news.
It's excellent news.
He's slowly regaining consciousness. Poor soul was shot point-blank.
He could identify who committed this brazen act.
I'll pray for his full recovery.
Praise be.
          SERENA And what did you imagine would become of your Handmaids after their service?
          AUNT LYDIA I didn't imagine.
I was promised they would become respected members of society.
          SERENA SCOFFS And you believed it.
You believed many things about Gilead before your recent travels.
What did you think happened to the Handmaids?
( exhales )
Did you even give it a thought?
No.
Why not?
I was unhappy. I...
I was trying to survive the world. I wanted a child.
My girls in your house suffered greatly.
And in yours as well.
This is foolish.
( Serena sighs ) Yes, well, one could say that any attempt to improve Gilead is foolish.
But I managed to open a fertility center in Canada, and it continues to thrive.
And that is relevant, how?
We could open a new fertility center here in New Bethlehem.
Could we stay focused on the Handmaids, please?
Yes, Aunt Lydia.
The Handmaids' brand is fertility.
That is offensive.
Let me put it in plain and simple words. The Handmaids could retire to New Bethlehem, and they could become attendants at the new fertility center.
( door opens )
( door closes )
That isn't a brand. That is a divine calling.
Pardon me, ma'am. This just arrived for you.
Oh.
Oh, uh, that's fine. Thank you.
You must want to know who sent such a lovely arrangement.
( rustling ) Commander Wharton would like to see me before he escorts Rose to D.C. this evening.
Another dance, dare I say, before his trip?
Well, let's not get too many ideas, Aunt Lydia.
Commander Wharton is exactly the kind of political support we need.
He is also a single man with a good fortune in want of a wife.
You do realize that Austen quote is the ultimate example of irony.
You know what's not ironic?
A healthy womb.
Which we both know must never go to waste.
Masks. Eyes on the penthouse.
Advise your friend. Rendezvous in two hours. Godspeed.

          JUNE We have to go up there.
Listen to me. We'll get in, we'll get out of there.
You two. What are you gabbing about?
          MOIRA STUTTERS Nothing, ma'am.
Get to work. This place is a sty.
          JUNE Ma'am, we were going to go up to the penthouse and make sure it's ready for the Commanders.
Get moving. Make it sparkle.
          JUNE Yes, ma'am.
( elevator dings )
( door closes )
Come back later. Commanders are expected.
          MOIRA Yes, sir. Um...
We were sent to check if it's ready for them.
( indistinct radio chatter ) Be quick about it.
( door opens )
          MOIRA Yes, sir.
Under His eye.
          JUNE Under His eye.

Are you getting us out?
          MOIRA Yeah, we got a plan for next week.

( indistinct chatter, laughter )
          JUNE There's just one Guardian in here and one at the door?
Yeah.
          BELL Gentlemen.
          JUNE sh¡t.
          MOIRA When do they change shifts?
Don't pick too early. It's embarrassing.
Hello. Hi.
Room 618.
          BELL Hi. Hello.
          JANINE Meet you there as soon as I can.
          BELL Where, oh, where is my kitty?
Here I am, sugar. Rawr!
( giggles )
( Bell chuckles ) JANINE
Mmm. ( chuckles )
Marthas, get your ugly butts out.
          CALHOUN Christ, he's slipping. What can I say?
( bottle pops ) Oh.
( both laughing )
Wait. You. Martha. Stop.
Here. Clean this up.
Come on. Let's go, let's go.
There you go.
Good girl.
Now the pants.
          CALHOUN LAUGHS God.
Can you believe this guy?
          BELL Higher.
          CALHOUN CHUCKLES No boundaries.
( Commanders laughing )
LAWRENCE
Bell, you're such a tool.
( Commanders laughing )
          BELL I said higher.
          CALHOUN What, are you bottom-feeding, Bell?
( Bell chuckles )
All right, miss. That's... that's enough.
Ignore these numbnuts. They have no manners.
( June exhales ) Go in grace.
( door opens ) Well, that's a match made in heaven, Lawrence.
A Martha's more your style.
( chuckles weakly )
( monitor beeping steadily ) Commander Blaine.
Please, don't get up.
We're graced by your visit, sir. So very kind of you.
The doctors said that my Toby would never wake up.
But he has, now and then.
That's encouraging.
He just mumbles, mainly.
They say his chances are still very slim.
He's so proud to be a Guardian.
And the way he looks up to those men in his unit.
Brave men of honor.
Like you, Commander.
Promise me you'll find out who did this to him.
Yes, ma'am.
I can stay with him, if you like. You must be tired.
You're an angel, Commander.
I should get back to his little brother for a bit.
I'll be back soon, sweetheart.
Praise be.
( Toby exhales ) Cold.
Yeah.
( exhales )
Do you know me, Toby?
( monitor beeping grows faster ) Where... where... where... where is my dog?
My dog.
( monitor beeps rapidly ) Your dog's fine.
Try and get some rest, okay?

          REYNOLDS So, Mercedes came in. Just crossed the border.
          CALHOUN You only got one, I managed to pick up two.
Lawrence.
You must have been happy to wake up to all your good press.
Well, it's good news for all of us.
New Bethlehem never would have happened without the support of the people in this room.
It was perhaps more permission than support.
Can I get you Commanders another drink?
Oh, good girl. Anticipating her master's needs.
          LAWRENCE There is nothing we have ever done that has been more effective in normalizing foreign relations.
          CALHOUN I will give you that.
And we could accelerate that timetable were we to expand.
How much and how quickly?
          LAWRENCE Well, New Bethlehem may double in size within the year.
I've designated at least a dozen sites where we could place new settlements.
Oh. I'd look at that.
Send it to me, too.
I'd be happy to.
There you go, sir.
Thank you.
( laughter ) Is there anything else at all that I can get for you?
( laughter )
          COMMANDER Uh-oh.
I've got an idea, you dirty little slսt.
Ow.
          BELL Come on.
( laughter )
          BELL Baby girl's asking for the belt.
Go. Go to the corner. Eyes to the wall and wait for me.
          LAWRENCE No.
I'm taking her.
The fսck you are.
Bell, come on.
What the fսck? You guys love this game.
A man deserves a reward for his hard work.
He clearly has a little crush.
Fine.
          LAWRENCE Let's go.
But leave the rough stuff to me. I want her back good as new. You're a pig, Bell. fսck you, Lawrence.
Why are you here?
Your brains? Your talent? Your impeccable charm?
Do you fսck¡ng believe this guy?
No one here likes you. No one.
And no one respects you.
Watch yourself.
Let's go.
BELL
What a fսck¡ng asshоlе.
( door closes )
( lock clicks ) Thank you.
They're disgusting.
Sorry.
You're not a good guy.
But...
Just compared to them, you are.
Thank you.
Look. I gotta go. I'll be right back. So just wait here.
( grunts ) There's... there's something you should see.
Girls snoop here sometimes.
See what fuckheads we're gonna be dealing with.
You can't let them win.
( door opens )
( door closes )
          CALHOUN He's a fool for thinking it would work in the first place.
How many years do we give up before we clamp down on New Bethlehem?
          CALHOUN Three or four.
We need to bring back as many people as we can first.
Re-absorb the populace.
Close down New Bethlehem and its offshoots. Close the borders.
Reinstitute tradition.
Lawrence will be the unwitting father of the second biggest coup in modern history.
And then we put him on the wall.
Ooh. He really hurt your feelings, didn't he?
Lawrence will fall in line. He always does.
I want him on the wall.
You think your father will allow it?
I can get him there.
Reynolds?
I like it.
He's done.
( sighs )
( sighs ) What could be taking so long?
She'll be here.
Don't worry. She's got a gauntlet of Commanders to get through.
I can't believe Lawrence was up there. He was never a Jezebel's guy.
You thought he was better than the rest?
Yeah, I guess I did.
( doorknob clicks )
God, have I missed you!
( both chuckle, exhale ) Come here.
What are you doing here?
          JUNE We're here to find you.
Mayday, Janine. They're coming.
They're gonna wipe out all the Commanders in the penthouse.
And we've gotta get all the women out, so we need you to prepare them.
          JUNE Can you trust them? Yes. And you can, too.
Look, I grabbed some letters that they wrote to their families. You... you have to get them out, no matter what. We will. We will. We promise.
You think you can get them all ready?
          JANINE Are you kidding?
The girls have had shivs made, just waiting for a moment like this.
Okay. How do the Commanders get up to the penthouse?
It's a secret elevator. It's straight from the garage.
They built it last year.
Great. That's good access in and out.
Mm-hm.
The key code is 1525.
The garage opens up here.
          MOIRA Mm-hm.
Make a right, then a left through the door, out to the cars.
Okay. Okay.
The exit's on the east side of the building.
Amazing. Thank you.
Okay. I, um... I can't be gone long, so...
Wait ten minutes before you go. Let me just...
The Guardians change shift every hour. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no.
Why don't you come back with us, okay? June.
You can come with us tonight, all right?
Really?
          JUNE Yeah. Could you get all of us out?
No. No, we cannot.
You have to wait until Mayday comes back.
But don't you need me here? I'll help the girls, get them ready.
Lead them out.
Yes. Yes, exactly.
Moira. Janine, someone else can do that.
No. They trust me.
Janine...
          JANINE I'm sorry.
I can't leave without my girls.
Mm-hm.
It's just a week.
          MOIRA Yeah. We'll see you soon.
Okay. Okay. But one week, okay?
Janine, one week.
Yeah. Okay.
I cannot believe you just did that.
What?
Now I'm the cold-hearted b¡tch that wouldn't rescue her.
I wasn't thinking about you. I was thinking about her.
Exactly. You don't give me a second thought.
I don't... I'm sorry. What are we talking about here?
Look, if we had taken Janine today, there'd be security all over this place, and our Mayday plan would have been screwed. Well, I'm sorry. I had to leave her in Chicago.
I know that, June. I was there, okay?
You don't think this is hard on me, too?
Well, it doesn't seem like it.
Wow.
I have been friends with her way longer.
We went through fսck¡ng hell together, her and I, okay?
We watched our friends die together.
So I'm sorry if I feel responsible for her.
I'm sorry if I feel guilty just abandoning her here.
Your guilt, your feelings, your friends, your trauma.
You, you, you. Do you have any idea how fսck¡ng sick of you I am?
No, I don't.
I don't know. Tell me.
Do I get to have PTSD?
Huh?
Do I get to have guilt?
Friends?
Trauma?
Especially here, in this fսck¡ng place.
In fսck¡ng Jezebel's, where I'm the one who, every single night, got raped and beaten.
'Cause I gotta tell you, being a fսck¡ng Handmaid looked like fսck¡ng heaven compared to what I had to go through in this place. Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
You're right.
You obviously had it worse than me.
Being a Jezebel is way harder than being a Handmaid.
Okay. ( scoffs ) Stop.
No. I mean, you know, you got raped a lot, and I just got raped a few times.
Sort of like a once-a-month kind of thing. So...
( chuckles ) Right, it uh...
You stayed in for longer. I got out quicker.
( chuckles ) Moira, you don't think I know?
( Moira sighs )
You don't think I know that I will never understand... what you went through?
I know that.
I know that. No.
You were raped, and so was I.
You were beaten, and so was I.
You were tortured, and so was I.
The point is, none of that should've ever happened to either of us.
And I just think if we start comparing our suffering... then those fuckers have won.
( feebly ) Yeah.
Right?
Yeah.
But I had no idea you hated me so much.
Wow.
( chuckles ) I don't hate you.
Well, I mean, seems like sometimes you may have hated me.
But I love you all the time.
Even if I don't feel like it.
I'm really sorry if I was a bad friend to you, okay?
What are you doing in here?
          MOIRA We're just cleaning the room, sir.
Uh-uh-uh-uh. Don't do that. You have such pretty faces.
( lock clicks )
          KERN I said take your mask down.
Sir, we don't want any trouble.
What's this? Hm?
I don't... I don't know, sir. We're just here to work.
          KERN Written materials.
You're in big trouble.
This is important to you?
( Moira exhales feebly )
( safe lock beeping )
You want it back? Get on the bed.
fսck off.
( chuckles softly ) Feisty.
You first.
Uh-uh-uh.
Back up. You stand right there. Right there, where I can fսck¡ng see you.
Don't you fսck¡ng move.
Come on. Let's go. Move.
Don't fսck¡ng move! You stay down. Come on.
Hey! fսck¡ng stay there. Right there. I'll start with you and then your friend.
Lie still.
Good girl. Don't move. Don't you move.
Don't you...

( Moira breathing heavily )
We gotta go.
Yeah. Yeah.
The letters. The map.
Look, when he doesn't check in, they're gonna lock this whole place down. ( lock beeps ) fսck.
We can't leave the body here.
We won't.
( footsteps clattering )
          SERENA Hello?
Is anybody here?
( door opens )
( door closes )
Commander Wharton. What is all this?
I've built a safe place for the children of New Bethlehem to come and read.
The boys and the girls.
( exclaims ) How wonderful.
You've inspired me.
( sighs ) I practically lived at the library as a child.
We'll be engraving the name, and I would really love your input.
I'm honored.
Let me show you.
( breath trembles )
I know it feels sudden, but it's... it's not for me.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
And I know if I didn't act now, I'd always regret it.
I didn't come back here to be a Wife.
I understand. And I don't mean to speak ill of the dead.
But Fred tried to erase the best parts of you, and I'd never do that. I want all of you.
I have a job to do here, in New Bethlehem.
Yes, of course. I want your good works to continue.
I can't move to D.C.
Well, when I'm there with Rose, I'll make plans to move my household to Boston.
But I can't live in Boston either.
Well, we'll split our time between here and a new house in the city.
One that you choose.
I will never stop writing. I don't want you to. And I know it's grandiose, but I really do believe that God brought me back here to change the country.
Let's change it together.
Are you sure you would be happy raising another man's child? I would be honored.
And don't you think Noah deserves a little brother or sister in the largest, most loving family that we can manage? ( sniffles ) I do.
( chuckles )
( Wharton chuckles ) Serena Joy, will you please do me the honor of marrying me?
( laughs ) Yes. Yes, I will.
( Serena chuckles )
( Wharton chuckles )
( June breathes heavily )
Come on, June.
( indistinct radio chatter )
          GUARDIAN Out.
          JUNE Ready?
Mm-hm.
You're picking up what now?
We're picking up empty barrels from the kitchen.
Come back tomorrow.
We can't, uh, sir.
We can't because we... we have deliveries we have to make tom... tomorrow, and we can't.

          GUARDIAN OVER RADIO Kern's MIA. Full sweep, all floors. sh¡t. Lockdown's about to start. Come on.
          MOIRA Okay.

No one in or out.

Uh, yeah. ( stutters ) But the thing is...
Yes, sir. We best return tomorrow.
All right. Yeah.
          ELLEN Another time.
          JUNE sh¡t. ( stutters ) Is it possible that we, we get...
          GUARDIAN Get back in the truck.
( June breathing heavily ) I get that there's a bit of a...
          JUNE Luke, no!
          GUARDIAN Get him out of here.
And don't come back.
          ELLEN No. Thank you.
          MOIRA He's okay. He's okay. He's gonna be all right.
But we are fսckеd. We gotta... Come on, come on. We gotta go this way.
( alarm continues blaring )
          MOIRA fսck. We need a key card.
What?
We need a Commander's key card to open that.
( door opens )
          JUNE Okay.
( door closes )
MOIRA
Let's go.
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no.
Come.
          MOIRA What?

MOIRA
Oh, fսck.
          JUNE It's okay.
June. June. Wait, wait.
( tires screech ) Oh, hell no.
( breathing heavily )
( car door opens ) Out of my way.
Please.
I need you to get us out of here. Us? She's with me.
What the hell's happening?
We got, like, 30 seconds to get out of here.
Please take us with you, Joseph.
Please.
Get in.
Come on.
Can you get us across the...

By the time the Marines landed in Southie, the fighting was almost over.
Gilead had already started pulling out of the city.
Then it only took 19 days.
But this is just the beginning.
First, Massachusetts is liberated, then New York.
West, across Ohio, Kansas.
Someday, Colorado.
And then Hannah.

( faint laughter ) ( people shouting ) man: Freedom! ( people cheering ) man 1: There it is! man 2: Yeah! man 1: There it is! We're free!
( cheering, whistling )
Yeah.

Moira: Hey.
Have you heard anything about Janine?
No.
( fire roaring )
June: Gilead tried to fight... but they had no leaders.
The Boston Commanders were all dead before the battle even started.
God always requires a sacrifice.
Luke: Hey, guys. Guys. We gotta load up the trucks.
We gotta go.
We need ammo and weapons in every truck. Don't bunch 'em up, all right?
Hey. Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah?
I saw Rita and Moira at the fire.
They're celebrating now.
Excellent.
Yeah, they've earned it.
( chuckles )
Hey, you haven't slept in days. You should go rest.
But I'm not tired. No, I'm not tired.
Yeah, I should be. It's weird.
But, yeah.
Hey, you know what? We got, um...
We got the union guys.
Yeah, we got some Boston city electrical workers.
We're gonna take them down to the power plant, get the lights back on.
Okay.
You're too busy to be tired.
Well, we're gonna get the electricals up and then, uh, power back on.
And then, hopefully, we can get Logan up and running.
And that means flights from Alaska.
We can get Holly and your mom down here.
( zippering ) That would be amazing.
Yeah.
What about New York? Is, uh... Is that where Mayday is going next?
Yeah. There's, uh, murmurs.
Obvi... Like, I've started making contacts with Mayday on the ground there, but, you know, I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.
( shuffling )
It's not Colorado, though, right?
( zippering ) Listen...
( exhales )
The way we get Hannah back is we take down Gilead one place at a time.
Okay.
( car honks )
( indistinct chatter )
I gotta go.
( sighs )
( indistinct chatter )
Hey.
Hey.
Any news?
There's been a big shuffle in Gilead command.
What does that have to do with Hannah?
Most of the western district Commanders have been promoted, including MacKenzie.
He's been reassigned to DC.
He's moving in with his wife and your daughter.
( sighs )
( sighing ) Okay.
Okay.
Hannah will be 2000 miles closer.
I know that isn't enough, but it's a kind of progress.
And, in any case, you are off duty.
You need to get some rest.
What are you, uh...
( exhales ) What are you doing to find Janine?
Mark: These are our people still trapped in Gilead.
( June exhales ) Not leaving any of them behind.
The Eyes have her? Is she... is she dead?
We don't know.
I'm sorry.
May God help her.
Or Aunt Lydia.
We've been in contact with her.
She was released by the Eyes.
She's finding out what she can about Janine.
Jesus.
fսck¡ng nine lives.
She's a survivor.
I may know something more about Janine in a few hours, if you want to stay close.
June: Thanks.
Yeah.
You look like sh¡t, Mark.
You should get some sleep.
( chuckles ) Thanks.
( both chuckle ) I'm not a great sleeper.
No?
Uh-uh.
( pensive music playing )	Portable speakers My son lives in Hawaii... with my ex-wife.
And when I close my eyes, I see... them.
And I get back to work.
This is the best thing I can do for him.
Bring down Gilead so he doesn't have to do it.
May God speed the days.
So we both can get some rest.

Yeah, I saw it.
Hannah: Where's the pink one?

Hannah: What's wrong with this?
And that has the black inside. No, wait.
June: Hey.
June: Can I have some?
Okay, not too much of that. Okay?
Okay.
June: Okay.
Sweetie, it's gonna make your stomach hurt.
Okay?
Okay.
Thank you, Banana.
You're welcome.
( chuckles )
Hi. Can I get five adult and five kid's, please?
Thank you.
Hannah?
Hannah?
Hannah?
( suspenseful music playing )
Sweetie? Hannah?
Hannah?
Excuse me. Have seen a little girl? She's...
Um, no.
woman: No. Sorry.
Hannah!
Oh, no.
Sweetie. Hannah!
Hannah! Come here!
Hi! Oh, my God. ( exhales sharply )
Are you okay?
Are you okay? Where'd you go?
You lost me.
What? No. No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Mommies always come back, remember?
Mommies always come back.

( Noah fussing )
Serena: Okay, um... let's see if we can find you something new 'cause you're getting to be such a big boy now, huh?
June: Serena.
Serena: Hey.
Praise be His mercy.
Congratulations on your victory.
None of it would've happened without you.
( chuckles ) Yes.
I am become death, destroyer of worlds. ( chuckles )
Guess I've helped Boston fall twice now.
( indistinct chatter )
Hmm.
( Noah fussing )
( June cooing )
( Serena shushing ) Can I help you?
Uh, yes. Yes.
June: Come on over, honey.
Hi! ( Noah cooing ) Oh. Oh.
( June shushes softly )
( sighs )
I am very sorry about Nick.
May his memory be a blessing and a comfort to you always.
( snickers )
Nick reaped what he sowed.
( people talking indistinctly )
He led a violent and... dishonest life, so...
You know, if he ever thought he had a real choice, he would've chosen you.
( Noah coos )
June chuckles: Okay.
Shall we see what we have here?
Let's see.
Yeah. Ooh, what's this?
( gasps softly )
It's perfect.
And I think it's your size.
It is a sign from God.
Signs are the realm of witches.
Well, we're not in Gilead anymore.
You know, I can never go back.
( gasps ) Perfect.
Too many people want me dead.
Canada won't give me a passport, and neither will the EU, so, uh... looks like I'm just nobody.
( snickers )
You're his mother.
( Noah fusses ) Just be that.
Just be that. Right?
( Noah coos ) Right?
Right?
Serena.
Now, please.
( Noah fussing )
Mark: Hey, two more.
Where are we going?
A UN refugee camp, for now.
Uh, okay. Um...
I... I don't have any passports yet for me.
I know. I know. I'm working on a solution.
So, what does that mean for me and my son?
It means you should try not to worry.
( chuckles ) ( bus stalling )
Right.
So, my fate is completely in your hands.
I'll find you.
( Noah fusses ) ( exhales sharply ) May God bless you.
Got him?
Yeah.
June: Okay.
All right. ( Noah fusses ) There we go.
Okay.
June, um... when I recall some of the things that were done to you and...
( sighs heavily )
.. the things that I did, and... that I forced you to do, I'm... I'm ashamed.
( somber music playing )	Portable speakers
You should be.
Yes.
And I'm sorry. And if words mean anything at all, I am sorry.
I forgive you, Serena.
I do. ( sobs softly ) Thank you.
God bless you, June.
( Noah coos ) Go in grace, Serena.
That was very generous of you.
You have to start somewhere, right?
New sector opened up.
Your old neighborhood.
If you have trouble at the checkpoints, use my name.
Thank you.
Oh, is it Captain... Tuello? It's Commander, actually.
( exhales )

( indistinct chatter ) Emily: This used to be an ice cream place.
They had this amazing salted caramel.
It'd cool if they reopened, wouldn't it?
Blessed be the fruit.
My fսck¡ng God.
That's blasphemy.
( chuckles )
Pious little sh¡t.
( June laughs )
June: So, you weren't in Boston?
Emily: Bridgeport.
It's a hotspot of rebellion, for some reason.
Really good pizza too.
Yeah, they do, praise be.
I was a Martha.
The Commander was a friend.
For how long?
Seven months.
But it was fairly safe, and eventually I was able to call Syl, so that was wonderful.
We had some things to work through.
Hmm.
But I Facetimed Oliver on his birthday.
It was only for a minute, but that was amazing.
And he's... he's getting really handsome, so we're in a lot of trouble.
( laughs )
So, you weren't... you weren't just gone?
Gone from their lives?
Yeah.
Of course not.
They're the reason I'm fighting.
June: Hmm.
I guess I just...
I thought, when you went back in, that you sort of left them.
I don't know if that's the way things work in the world. I...
I mean, whatever choice you make or try to make, some things stay true.
I love Syl and Oliver. We're a family.	Gift baskets
( June sighs ) They strung up all the Guardians.
Emily: Rage is a gift from God.
It's meant to be shared with the most deserving.
Yeah, and then what?
They still have Hannah.
And it doesn't matter how angry I get. It doesn't matter how unfair it is.
They stole my life.

And I want it all back the way it was supposed to be.
( sighs ) But that's fսck¡ng pointless.
( sighs )
Some things are impossible.
I don't know.
We are both alive to see this.
Together.
I'm thinking of adjusting my concept of the impossible.
( somber music playing )	Portable speakers June: I've been dreaming of Boston.
Not Boston now, and not Boston from before.
It's another Boston.
It's the way things would be if there was never a Gilead.

I need you to come with me right now. It's urgent, ma'am.
( gasps softly )
( tense music playing )
Good evening. Sorry about the hour.
What happened?
We need a familiar face.
Where are we?
Millerville, Mass.
Near the old Rhode Island line.
It's the new border with Gilead.
Who is it?
( somber music playing )	Portable speakers
( gasping ) Mark: We need medical.
Oh, come here. Hey, baby.
Come here. You're okay.
You're okay.
Shh. ( Janine moans weakly )
June: You're okay.
Yeah.
You're okay. sobbing ) Hi. Hi. ( sobbing ) Hi. Hi.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, I want you to be safe.
That's the most important thing.
Right?
I love you.
Janine.
Look who's here.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
( sobbing ) ( Angela laughs ) Hi!
Janine: Hi, sweetheart.
( sobbing ) Mark: Come on, now.
Let's get you warm.
Thank you.
( sniffles )
Take good care of our Janine, please.
And Charlotte.
I will.
( exhales ) Lydia.
Thank you.
Blessed is the woman who does not walk in stride with the wicked.
Under His eye, dear. ( indistinct chatter ) man: Next bus from Logan with passengers from Alaska is arriving in less than one minute.
( indistinct shouting )
Dad!
Here! Mom!
woman: Oh, my God. Hi, guys. Hi! Hi! ( laughs ) driver: Please stand back!
Do not crowd the arrival area!
There she is! driver: Please give the passengers room to come in! Thank you!
( chuckles )
( laughs ) Hi!
Luke: Holly!
Hello, Luke.
Luke: Aw.
( Holly laughs ) ( Nichole crying ) Luke: Aw.
( indistinct chatter )
( Nichole coos ) I know.
Jetlag sucks, doesn't it?
You'll be all better tomorrow, okay?
And you're safe.
It's my job to keep you safe. You know that?
You and your sister.
And I have another job too, I think.
( exhales )
I think I have to do my best... to help keep all the little girls in Gilead safe too.
If I can. sighs )
I have to try.
And in order to do that, I'm gonna have to leave you again, okay?
( gulps, sniffles ) Because...
I need you to be safe.
And where I'm going, you won't be.
So... you're gonna have to stay with Grandma just a little while longer, all right?
I'm sorry.
( Nichole coos )
But you know what?
Can I tell you something?
You don't have to be near Mommy in order to feel her love.	Gift baskets
It'll find you no matter where you are.
( exhales, sniffles ) No matter where you are.
It'll find you.
( sniffles )
Hey.
Hmm?
Can you watch her?
Yeah, I got her.
( June exhales )
( sighs )
Is that okay? ( exhales ) If you watch her for a little bit longer?
How much longer is a little longer?
I'm not sure yet.
( sobbing ) But who will keep you safe?
( sighs ) Mom.
Mom, it's...
( sniffles ) That's my job.
I know. ( chuckles softly ) But the thing is, Mom, I'm...
I'm not safe.
Neither are you.
( exhales slowly )
And they are never going to stop... coming for us.
And even when we're gone... they're gonna come for our children... and our grandchildren.
Fighting may not get us everything, but we don't have a choice.
Because not fighting is what got us Gilead in the first place.
And Gilead doesn't need to be beaten.
It needs to be broken.
( sniffles ) Can't someone else break 'em?
You taught me how to fight.
( June chuckles )
You were there. You were out almost every night.
At protests, and meetings, and the...
( chuckles softly ) You taught me.
And you know me.
( chuckles )
Right? I mean, you know me pretty well.
And you know I'm not gonna give up.
I think I'm just getting to know you.
( June chuckles )
I see the amazing woman you are now.
( snickers )
Thanks, Mom.
Mom, sometimes I don't know if I'm doing a very good job... ( sniffles ) as a mom, you know?
Oh, sh... That's bullshit, sweetheart.
You're a great mother. chuckles weakly )

And I make sure she... she knows that.
I tell her your whole story.
How you saved so many women, and how you escaped, how you survived.
She should know that her mother is a warrior.
( sighs )
June, you should write a book.
It's not a very good story, Mom.
There is so much violence and fear.
And loss.
No, sweetheart.
It's about never giving up.
It isn't a story for the people who haven't lost anyone.
They don't need this story.
This is the story for people who may never find their babies, the people who will never ever give up trying.
This is the story for them.
Write it for our sweet baby girl.
And our Hannah.
Write it for your daughters, June.
Tell them who their mother was.
Luke: That was a great job, man. Excellent.
June: You got the power on.
Yeah, we did.
Turning lights on and heat for hundreds of thousands of people.
( June chuckles ) You know, NBD. No big deal.
( exhales ) I underestimated you.
You did.
Sorry.
We're so... so different now.
Yeah.
Both of us.
It's inevitable that we're gonna make mistakes and...
We don't know each other like we did before.
( chuckles ) Yeah.
I mean, was there even a before?
( people talking indistinctly )
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there was a before.
( chuckles softly )
There's gonna be an after too.
( chuckles softly )
Yeah.
You know, uh, Mayday is moving out in a couple of days.
Moira's getting them together. ( laughs )
Uh, I found a base up on the New York border. I want to recce it.
Someplace to hide out, start fսck¡ng sh¡t up again.
( chuckles )
Be careful, huh?
Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna be careful.
What about you?
I'm gonna talk to Mark. I'm gonna see what... what he's doing next and... go state by state, figure out a plan.
I'm gonna go to her, Luke. I'm gonna go get Hannah.
( exhales )
( chuckles ) What else is there? ( somber music playing )	Portable speakers
So, meet you there?
Yeah. fսck, yeah. fսck, yeah.
See you there.
You know, you... you should... you should write this down before you forget it.
Your escape story.
No.
I mean it. It wasn't all horrors, right?
You had people who helped you.
Like Janine, and Emily, and Lawrence... and Nick. ( exhales )
People who loved you.
People who you loved.
They're all worth remembering.
( snickers )
( imperceptible )
Okay -I wish I had somewhere quieter for you, but we're bursting at the seams.
( Noah fussing )
This will be fine for us. Thank you.
Yeah. Well, a chair, a table, a bed. All you need, I guess.
Uh, is there, uh, someplace, uh, I can get some, uh, diapers and clothes?
I'll ask.
Thank you. God bless you.
We're not really supposed to have kids here anyway.
You might have to find another place for tomorrow.
Uh, okay. Yes, uh, we'll... we'll move if we have to.
Sorry.
Oh. ( Noah fussing ) Thank you.
Okay. I know.
( Noah cries )
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't even have a change of clothes for you for later. I'm sorry.
Oh, hey, look. Okay.
( Noah fussing )
Mmm. ( exhales )
( chuckles )
And she shall provide.
Look at what we have here, huh? Hmm?
( inhales )
( Noah fussing )
Oh, I know.
I know. I know. It's been... it's been a long day.
It's been a long day.
You are my most precious gift from God.
Do you know that?
( sniffles )
You are the most important thing in the world.
Do you know how much I prayed for you?
And now you're here.
And you're perfect.
And... ( sighs ) and you're all I need.
You're all I need.
( sobs softly )
( somber music playing )	Portable speakers
You're all I ever wanted.
( Noah fusses ) I'm so blessed.
My beautiful baby boy.
( indistinct chatter )
( Noah fussing )
( slow suspenseful music playing )
( gate creaks )
( breath trembles )
( exhales )
( door creaking )
( clicks )
A chair, a table, a lamp... and a window with white curtains.
And the glass is shatterproof.
But... it isn't running away they're afraid of.
A Handmaid wouldn't get far.
