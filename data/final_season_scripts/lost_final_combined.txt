Previously on Lost:

They come, they fight, they destroy,

they corrupt. It always ends the same.

But it only ends once. Anything that
happens before that is just progress.

I'm not gonna kill Jacob, Ben.

You are.

They're coming.

The Dharma folks at the Swan worksite,
they're gonna drill into the ground

and accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy.

I think I can negate that energy.
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

If we can do what Faraday said,
our plane never crashes.




Flight 815 lands in Los Angeles.

- Juliet!
- No!

I got you.
No, don't let go!

Juliet! No!

Come on!

Come on! Come on,
you son of a bitch!

So how's the drink?

- It's good.
- That's not a very strong reaction.

Well, it's...
It's not a very strong drink.

- Don't tell anyone.
- It'll be our secret.

Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has
turned on the "fasten seat belts" sign.

- Please return to your seats.
- It's normal.

My husband said the planes
want to stay in the air.

Sounds like a smart man.




You be sure and tell him that
when he gets back from the bathroom.

Well, I'll keep you company
until he does.

Don't worry, it'll be...

You can let go now.

It's Ok. You can let go.

- Looks like we made it.
- Yeah. We sure did.

Sorry about the unexpected bumps, folks.
We just hit a pocket of rough air.

It should be a smooth ride
from here on out.

Remind me to hold it next time, will ya?

I almost died in that bathroom.

Now I know how the laundry feels
when it's in the dryer.

- I missed you.
- I missed you, too, beautiful.

- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, mate. Is this your seat?

- The stewardess said it was empty.
- No, I'm at the window.

Oh, right.

Do you mind if I sit here?

The fella next to me has been
snoring since we took off from Sydney.

- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks, brother.

- Something wrong?
- No, you just...

Do I know you from somewhere?

Well, I'm not sure.

- Desmond.
- Jack.

Nice to meet you, Jack.

Or to see you again.

Juliet!

No! No, don't let go!

Juliet! No!

Come on. Come on,
you son of a bitch!

Hey!

Hello?

Hello?!

Hey!

Hey! Hey! Kate!
It's Ok. It's me, Miles. It's Ok.

- What happened?
- What?

Where are we?

I can't... I can't hear you.
Are your ears ringing?

What is it?

- We're back.
- Back where?

No.

Is that the construction site?

No. That's the Swan hatch...

after Desmond blew it up.

Guess we're not in 1977.

Jack? Jack.

Can you hear me? Jack!

What happened?

- Where are we?
- At the hatch.

- What? They built it?
- Yeah. They built it.

Sawyer!

You were wrong!

That's the damn Swan hatch!

Blown up, just like we left it,
before we started jumping through time!

You said we could stop it
from ever being built!

That our plane would never
crash on this island!

- Stop it! Stop it!
- This ain't LAX!

You blew us right back
where we started!

Except Juliet's dead.

She's dead, you son of a bitch,
'cause you were wrong.

Sawyer...

I'm sorry.

I thought we were supposed to...

- I thought it would work.
- Well, it didn't!

- You in line?
- No, I'm just waiting for my friend.

- I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
- It's Ok. It's Ok.

Best get back to our seats, sweetheart.

Lasagna.

No. No knife and fork for you, honey.

What do you think I'm gonna do,
stab you and run?

Hey, watch where you're going, buddy.

Sorry. My bad.

Say it. Come on, please? Just once.

- I really don't want to, dude.
- I love those commercials.

Come on, just do the Australian accent,
and I'll leave you alone.

All right. Fine. All right.

Oiy! Have a
cluckity-cluck day, mate!

That's...

You know who this is?

This is the owner
of Mr. Cluck's Chicken.

And he's back here
riding coach with the rest of us yutzes!

- How about that?
- Hey... Do you mind me asking,

how exactly did a guy like you
get to own a major corporation?

I won the lottery
and I like chicken, so I bought it.

Good. Good for you.

You know, you really shouldn't
tell people you won the lottery.

Yeah? Why not?

'Cause they'll take advantage of you.
That's why not.

Thanks for the advice,
but it's not gonna happen.

It's not?

Nope. Nothing bad ever happens to me.

I'm the luckiest guy alive.

- What just happened?
- I found a flashlight.

Dude, who cares?
The sky just went from day to night.

- What happened?!
- I think we moved through time.

How do you know that?

Go white flash. Headache. Can't hear.

- Happened to me before.
- Shhh.

- Back to this island!
- You hear that, dude?

- It's Sawyer.
- Stay here with Sayid.

If you've got an explanation, Jack,
I'm waiting to hear it!

The bomb must've gone off.

You think if the atom bomb went off,
we'd still be standing here?!

- I don't know.
- That's right! You don't!

- For once, you don't know!
- Jack!

- Sayid needs help.
- Where is he?

With Hurley at the van.
Two minutes away.

He's still bleeding.
We don't know what to do.

Help me.

What do you say, Doc?
Got another great idea to save Sayid?

- Maybe there's a nuke laying around.
- Hey, shut up!

Help!

Juliet!

- James?
- Oh, my God.

Juliet!

Oh, God. Oh, God, this is gross.

Don't worry, dude.
Everything's gonna be fine.

When I die...

what do you think will happen to me?

Just try not to talk, dude.

I've tortured more people
than I can remember.

I've murdered.

Wherever I'm going...

it can't be very pleasant.

- Sayid, come on.
- I deserve it.

Hello?

Jin?

Jin!

I've got a gun!

And I know how to shoot it!

Hello, Hugo.

You got a minute?

You're wasting your time, man.

This plane goes down
in the ocean out here,

I think our chances of survival
are exactly zero.

Actually, in calm seas
with a good pilot,

we could survive a water landing.

And the fuel tanks are buoyant enough

to keep us afloat
until we got in the life rafts.

- What?
- No, it's impressive you know that.

What were you doing in Australia?
Business or pleasure?

Pleasure. You?

I went down to get my sister
out of a bad relationship

that, it turns out,
she didn't want to get out of.

So... here I am.

So, what, you were just
down under for vacation?

- Actually, I went on a walkabout.
- Really?

- Like... like Crocodile Dundee?
- No, not exactly.

But... But it was pretty intense.
We spent ten days in the outback

in nothing but our packs and our knives.

We slept under the stars
and made our own fires,

- hunted our own food.
- Wow.

I wouldn't make it two days
without my cell phone.

- You're not pulling my leg, are ya?
- Why would I pull your leg?

This thing goes down,
I'm sticking with you.

You can stop staring at the fire.

Jacob's gone.

He's gone.

Ben, I want you to go outside

and tell Richard
that I need to talk to him.

Talk to him about what?

That's between me and Richard.

- There's no other reason.
- That's not how it's gonna be.

- You have to...
- You're not going in there.

Listen to me. I already did.
Now I'm asking you to...

Just back up a little. Back up.

Who are they?

Other than the fact that I know
they were on the Ajira flight with us,

all I know is they knocked me out
and dragged my ass to some cabin,

which they promptly burned, then...

brought me here
along with the dead guy in the box.

They say they're the good guys.

I'm not buying it either.

Listen to me. Listen to me,
and listen carefully.

No one goes in there
unless Jacob invites them in.

Richard, that's why we're here,
because Jacob invited us.

Asking me what's in the shadow of the
statue, doesn't mean you're in charge.

- Then who is?
- Richard.

Ben.

- What happened in there?
- Everything's fine.

John wants to speak to you.

- Is Jacob all right?
- I'm sorry. Who are you?

- Answer her question, Ben.
- Well, of course Jacob's all right.

They're both together inside.
John just wants to talk to you.

- John wants to talk to me?
- That's right.

Richard, what are you doing?
I don't understand.

I'm happy to talk to John.

But, before I do, maybe you
should talk to him first.

Hang on, Juliet! We're coming!

Jin. Flashlight.

If we could move this beam,
I think I can get down there!

Too heavy. We need
something to pull it. Jin!

The van!
There's chains in it. Go get 'em!

Where you going, dude?

And what are you doing here?

I mean, I meet you in a taxi,
you know everything about me,

you give me a plane ticket,
which just so happens

to get me back on this island.
How'd you know that was gonna happen?

Hello!

Can you hear me? Why aren't
you answering my questions?

My friend Jin's gonna be here
any second, so stop ignoring me...

Your friend Jin won't be able to see me.

- Why not?
- Because I died an hour ago.

- Sorry, dude. That sucks.
- Thanks.

How'd you die?

I was killed by an old friend
who grew tired of my company.

You want me to do
something crazy again?

No. I need you to save Sayid, Hugo.

- That's why Jin went to get Jack...
- Jin can't help him.

You need to take Sayid to the Temple.

That's the only chance he's got.

And the rest of them will be safe there.

The Temple?
I'm supposed to know what that is?

Jin knows.

Tell him to take you to the hole in the
wall where he was with the French team.

Through that opening,
you can get into the Temple.

You still have
that guitar case I gave you?

- Yeah.
- Bring it.

Who are you, dude?

I'm Jacob.

Hurley! Help me with Sayid.

We have to get him into the van.
Juliet needs our help.

Come on! We have to go!

Jin, if I asked you to take me to
where there's, like, a hole in the wall,

where you went with the French team,
would you know what I was talking about?

- Yes.
- Good.

I'll get the chain.

Juliet?

Stop it. Stop, Sawyer.
The van is here. The chains are coming.

She ain't making any more noises.

She knows we're here.
She's probably just resting.

Juliet!

If she dies, I'll kill him.

Ladies and gentlemen,
nothing to be alarmed about,

but if there is a doctor on board,
would you please press your call button?

Sir, you're a doctor?

- Yes.
- Could you come with me, please?

We appreciate your help. A passenger
went into the restroom half an hour ago,

and he's not responding when we knock.

This man's a doctor.

- If he's unconscious in there...
- The lock. It's jammed or something.

Can I be of assistance?

Excuse me.

He's not breathing.

What's going on back there, Earhart?

Everything's fine, sir.
Please just stay in your seat.

Looks peachy.

- I'm gonna need your help.
- What can I do?

I need you...

Hold this over his nose and mouth.
Hold it there,

- and do not let any air escape.
- Ok. Now?

Yes, now.

Something's blocking his air passage.

We have to open it up. I need
something sharp... A razor.

- I got a pen.
- A pen?

It's regulations.
There's nothing sharp.

A pen! Just a pen.

I had a pen in my jacket, but it's gone.

Damn it.

I got it. I got it.

Relax. Just relax. Breathe.

Am I alive?

Yeah. Yeah, you're alive.

Terrific.

- You got it?
- Ok, Jin! We're good down here!

Hit it!

Give me the flashlight.

Juliet.

Ok. All right.

Juliet. Come here.

Juliet?

Hey, hey, hey.

I'm here. Come on, baby.
Hey, come on, wake up.

Wake up.

Hi.

Hey.

Where... Where are we?

Don't worry about that. You're fine.

I gotta get you out of here, Ok?

It didn't work.

We're still on the island.

It's Ok. It's Ok.

I just gotta get this loose enough
to get you out, Ok?

No, I hit the bomb.
You're still here.

You what?

You hit the bomb?

Why?

I wanted you to be able to go home.

I wanted to make it so that
you never came to this damn island.

And it didn't work.

Don't you worry about that.

You're gonna be Ok.

I'm gonna get you out of here and we're
gonna go home together. You hear me?

Sawyer?

Even though I could get the bullet out,
the bleeding won't stop.

There's nothing I can do for him.

There's something I can do.

There's a temple. If we can
get Sayid there, we can save him.

And you know this how?

This guy, Jacob, told me
just before he got here.

Who's Jacob?

Does it matter?
Can you fix Sayid, Jack?

No.

Then you're gonna have to let me do it.

- What are you doing?
- We're going in,

and he's coming with us.

Where's Richard?

He's not coming.

Then who is that behind you?

- Where's Jacob?
- Jacob is dead.

- Who are you?
- Don't worry about me.

Let's talk about you.

I'm assuming that you are...
what, Jacob's bodyguards,

and that you came all the way
to this island to protect him?

Well, I have good news.

Jacob burned up
right there in that fire.

Therefore, there's nothing left
for you to protect. You can go.

You're free.

Kill him!

Spread out! Get him!

Where is he?!

I'm sorry you had to see me like that.

- Sawyer? Is she Ok?
- I'm working on it!

- Ok, I got you.
- James.

I got you. Ok.
There you are. Ok. Ok.

Don't worry.

We could get coffee some time.

I gotta get you out of here.

We can go Dutch.

Hey... Juliet?

It's me.

- James.
- Yeah?

Kiss me.

You got it, Blondie.

I have to tell you something.

It's really, really important.

You tell me.

You tell me.

Julie?

You tell me.

Oh, God.

I'm here.

I'm... I'm here, baby.

You did this.

You should've let that happen, man.

I was supposed to die.

Don't take it personally. Some people
just don't know how to say thanks.

Excuse me, do you know what happened
to the guy sitting next to me?

Oh, we were asleep.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Captain Norris here.

We're now beginning our final descent
into Los Angeles International Airport.

I'm happy to tell you it's
a beautiful day in Los Angeles.

Seventy-two degrees,
six miles visibility

and winds out of the southwest
at five miles an hour.

Buckle up. You're almost home.

I'll be putting on the
"fasten seat belts" sign now.

We'll be on the ground in a few minutes.
Thank you for flying Oceanic Air.

.:

Previously on Lost:

- Who is he?
- His name is Richard Alpert.

He's a kind of... advisor.

And he has had that job
for a very, very long time.

- Why do you want to die?
- I devoted my life,

longer than you can
possibly imagine, in service of a man

who told me that everything
was happening for a reason.

That he had a plan.
A plan that I was a part of.

And now that man's gone. So...

Why do I want to die? Because I just
found out my entire life had no purpose.

I'm here because I need your help.




Will you help me, Ilana?

Yes.

There's six people
I need you to protect.

I'm gonna give you
a list of their names.

This is what you've been preparing for.

These people... who are they?

They're the remaining candidates.

Candidates?

Candidates for what?

To replace Jacob.

She said I was one of them.

And so are you, and so is Hurley.

Well, that's great.
So, what do we do now?

- I don't know.
- Then who does?




After I've brought them to the Temple...

...what do I do?

Ask Ricardus.

He'll know what to do next.

Who's Ricardus?

He is.

So, Richard...

...what do we do next?

I have no idea what we do next.

You didn't tell your friends that I was
trying to kill myself when you found me?

Does that sound like someone
who has a plan?

Why would Jacob say
you knew what to do if...

Because everything
he ever said is a lie.

What are you talking about?

You wanna know a secret, Jack?

Something I've known a long, long time?

You're dead.

- You mean that figuratively?
- No. I mean, literally.

We're all dead, every single one of us.

And this? This, all this?

It's not what you think it is.
We're not on an island. We never were.

We're in hell.

So I'm not interested
in what Jacob said.

In fact, maybe it's time
we stopped listening to him,

and we started listening
to someone else.

And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

What are you doing?

- I'm going after Richard.
- Why?

You heard him. He doesn't know
what we need to do next.

He knows.

Jacob told me. He has to know.

Alpert has lost his mind.

He thinks that we're... we're in hell.

If he cared about what Jacob said,
he wouldn't be talking about

listening to someone else.

Wait. You know who he meant?

- This should be interesting.
- What?

He meant Locke.

Locke is dead.

If it's any consolation,
it's not exactly Locke.

Hurley.

- What's he sayin'?
- What's who saying?

Jacob. I saw you talking to him.

- I'm not talking to Jacob.
- Don't lie to me.

If you know anything
that can help us...

It's not Jacob, man.

Then who is it?

Sorry, but this has
nothing to do with you.

- Shephard is right, you know.
- Right about what?

Richard. Going after him
is a waste of time.

He doesn't know anything.

What makes you so sure?

I've known him
since I was 12 years old.

That should count for something.

- So you guys met when you were kids?
- No, Frank, I was a kid.

Richard looked just like he does today.

- You're saying this guy doesn't age?
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

How the hell you think that happened?

No. No, no, no.

Isabella.

Isabella. Isabella.

No, no.

No! No!

Amen.

No.

- Is this him?
- Yes.

- You say he speaks English?
- Yes, Mr. Whitfield.

Do you speak English?

I asked, do you speak English?

Take him away and bring me another.

- Hang him.
- Yes, I speak English!

- Yes, I speak English!
- Wait.

You have strong hands.
What sort of work did you do?

I work... I work... in the fields.

I understand you're interested
in going to the New World. Yes?

- Yes.
- Well, then...

This is your lucky day.
Thank you, Father.

This man is now the property
of Captain Magnus Hanso.

I hope you don't get seasick.

Do you see anything?!

- Bring me the captain.
- Sir, Captain Hanso's dead.

Good God, we're in the middle
of a bloody jungle!

Help! Down here, please!

Down here!

- No!
- No! Stop!

Stop!

No, stop!

- No, no, no. No. No.
- No...

No! Stop!

What are you doing?!

We are shipwrecked
in the middle of the jungle.

We have no fresh water

and limited supplies,

and there are only five officers left.

No! No! No!

Why are you doing this?

Because if I freed you,

it would only be a matter of time
before you tried to kill me.

No!

What happened up there?

I said, report!

No!

No! No!

Isabella!

Here. Water.

Who...?

Who... who are you?

- A friend.
- I am...

...in hell?

Yes, I'm afraid you are.

You...

You were not on the ship.

I was here...

...long before your ship.

Did... did you see my wife?

- I'm sorry?
- Isabella. My wife.

She was here. She was...

But then... then the black smoke came,

and she ran.

And she hasn't come back?

- That probably means he has her.
- Who?

I think you know who.

If she's alive, I must save her.

- Please. Please, help me.
- Of course.

Of course I'll help.

I want to be free too.

As luck would have it...

...I found these on
one of the officers outside.

I think they'll work.
But before I try,

I need to know that you will help me.

Yes. Yes. Of course.

- You'll do anything I ask?
- Yes. Yes, anything.

Yeah, I promise.

Then we're agreed.

- Thank you.
- Of course, my friend.

It's good to see you
out of those chains.

Thank you.

We're gonna have
to get you on your feet.

You're gonna need your strength
if we're going to escape.

Escape?

That's right.

I'm afraid there's only one way
to escape from hell.

You're going to have to kill the devil.

When you're finished eating,

you'll walk due west.

Once you get to the ocean,

you'll be able to see the statue.

- The statue?
- Your ship smashed through it

on its way inland.

Broke it into pieces.
That's where you'll find the devil.

You'll only have one chance.

Put this through his chest. Do not
hesitate. Do not let him say a word.

If he speaks,
it will already be too late.

He can be very persuasive.

How can I kill him with this?
He is... black smoke.

No.

I am.

My wife, Isabella...

She was running from you?

She was running from him.

I'm sorry.

I saw him take her, but I
couldn't do anything to stop him.

But if you are the black smoke, you...

You aren't the only one
who's lost something, my friend.

The devil betrayed me.

He took my body,

my humanity.

You killed the officers on the ship.

I'm not the one
you need to worry about.

The devil has your wife,

and you are going to have to kill him
if you want to get her back.

Murder is wrong.
That is what brought me here.

My friend...

...you and I can talk all day long
about what's right or wrong.

But the question before you
remains the same.

Do you ever want
to see your wife again?

Yes, I do.

What are you doing here?!

- Who gave you this?!
- Where is my wife?

- What?
- Where is my wife?

I don't know your wife.

- Did she come here on the ship?
- No. She's dead.

Then why are you asking me
where she is?

Did you meet a man in the jungle
dressed in black?

Yes.

- What did he tell you?
- He said you are the devil.

- And?
- He said the only way I would see

my wife again is if I kill you.

I saw her here...

- ...in this place. Where is she?!
- That wasn't your wife.

Yes, it was!

- She is dead, just like me.
- You're not dead.

I am in hell.
I know that I am in hell!

- You really think you're dead?
- Where else would I be?

- All right then.
- What are you doing?

No, no, no, no!

- Still think you're dead?!
- Stop!

Stop!

- Still think you're dead?!
- Stop!

Why should I stop?!

Because I want to live!

That's the first sensible thing
you've said.

- What's your name?
- Ricardo.

Ricardo.

Get up. We need to talk.

- What is inside?
- No one comes in unless I invite them.

Are you the devil?

No.

Then who are you?

My name is Jacob.

I'm the one who brought
your ship to this island.

You brought it here?

Why?

Think of this wine
as what you keep calling "hell."

There's many other names for it too.

"Malevolence."

"Evil."

"Darkness."

And here it is,
swirling around in the bottle,

unable to get out,
because if it did, it would spread.

The cork...

...is this island.

And it's the only thing
keeping the darkness...

...where it belongs.

That man who sent you to kill me
believes that everyone is corruptible

because it's
in their very nature to sin.

I bring people here to prove him wrong.

And when they get here,
their past doesn't matter.

Before you brought my ship,
there were others?

Yes. Many.

- What happened to them?
- They're all dead.

If you brought them,
why didn't you help them?

Because I wanted them
to help themselves...

To know the difference
between right and wrong

without me having to tell them.

It's all meaningless if I have
to force them to do anything.

- Why should I have to step in?
- If you don't, he will.

Do you want a job?

What? A job?

Doing what?

Well...

...if I don't want to step in,

maybe you can do it for me.

You can be my...
my representative,

an intermediary between me
and the people

- I bring to the island.
- Well, what will I get in return?

- You tell me.
- I want my wife back.

Can't do that.

Can you absolve me of my sins
so I don't go to hell?

I can't do that either.

Then I never want to die.
I... I want to live forever.

Now that...

...I can do.

You let him talk to you, didn't you?

He told me to give you this.

I'm sure you realize,
if you go with him,

you'll never be with your wife again.

I understand.

He can be very... convincing.

But I want you to know,
if you ever change your mind,

and I mean ever...

...my offer still stands.

I have something for you.

You must have dropped it.

I found it on the ship.

I've changed my mind.

Are you listening to me?

I've changed my mind.

I was wrong!

You said I could change my mind.

You said the offer would stand!

Does the offer still stand?

What offer, dude?

What the hell are you doing out here?
Did you follow me?

- Well, kinda.
- Get out! Get out!

- Didn't you hear what I said?
- I was just...

- I told you, I don't know anything!
- Calm down!

- Why did you follow me?!
- Your wife sent me!

What did you say?

I said your wife sent me. Isabella.

She wants to know
why you buried her cross.

How do you know about that?

- Because she just told me.
- What do you mean, just told you?

Isabella saw you dig it up, man.

She's standing right next to you.

I don't see her.

She's right there.

She says your English is awesome.

She wants you to close your eyes.

It's OK. I'll tell you what she says.

Is she gone?

Yeah.

Thank you.

Yeah, you got it.

Is something wrong?

She kinda said one more thing.

Something you have to do.

What?

She said you have to stop
the Man in Black.

You have to stop him
from leaving the island.

'Cause if you don't...

- Good morning.
- Morning.

I see you got my present.

Don't gloat, Jacob.
It doesn't become you.

So you tried to kill me.

- You expect an apology?
- No.

- I'm just wondering why you did it.
- Because I want to leave.

Just let me leave, Jacob.

As long as I'm alive,
you're not going anywhere.

Well, then now you know
why I want to kill you.

And I will kill you, Jacob.

- Somebody else will take my place.
- Well, then I'll kill them too.

Here.

Something for you to pass the time.

I'll see you around.

Sooner than you think.

- This island's goin' down!
- Linus, come in!

Linus, come in!

Linus, come in!

Come in!

Miles, is that you?

Yeah. What... what the
hell is happening?

Are you with Claire?

She's here, but she
doesn't want to come with us.

Come with you where?

Lapidus is working on
the plane right now,

then we're taking off.




Hey, how much longer till
we get this thing in the air?

I still have to check the
electrical and the hydraulics!

- Five hours, maybe six.
- You've got, maybe one!

Get your asses over here!
We're leaving in an hour!

Son of a bitch!

How the hell are we supposed
to get over there?!

I know how we can get there!

Locke has a boat!

Locke!

I want you to know, Jack...

You died for nothing.

Aah! Uhh!

I saved you a bullet!

You're too late.




Nice work, Dr. Shephard.

What happened to your neck?

Damn it.

Okay, he's stable.
I'm gonna hop in the shower

and see if I can catch up with
David before the concert's over.

So just give me a
call if you need me.

Dr. Shephard?
He's waking up.

I watched the anesthesiologist,
he got the full dosage.

Okay.

I'll take it from here.

Mr. Locke?

Can you hear me?

John, are you awake?

You just had major surgery,

so I need you
to try not to move

and just relax, okay?

It worked.

Well, it went well.

But we won't know how well you
responded to the surgery for...

No, Dr. Shephard. It worked.

I can feel my legs.

John, it's highly unlikely

that you would regain
sensation that quickly.

So let's just take it sl...

Ooh.

Oh!

?

Ohh.

- Did you see that?
- See what?

You don't remember?

Um...

Mr. Locke,

please, just, uh... just relax.

- What we need to do...
- What we need to do is go.

No, no, no. Hey, John.

- Will you come with me?
- We're not going anywhere.

You just had extensive
spinal surgery...

and I-I need
to go see my son.

You don't have a son.

What?

You don't have a son, Jack.

Doctor?

Jane, um...

Would you give Mr. Locke
something to help him rest?

I need to go.

Jack.

I hope that
somebody does for you...

what you just did for me.

Oh. Oh, my God.

Oh!

- Ohh. Jack.
- I'll be fine.

Just find me some thread,
and I can count to five.

Hey!

Oh, my God!

What the hell happened?

Locke's dead.

It's over.

It sure don't feel like it's over.

Excuse me. Ms. Paik?

Yes?

Hi.

I'm Detective Ford. L.A.P.D.

I'm sorry. I heard you were shot,

but I didn't expect you
to be checking out so soon.

Hey.

Hello... Detective.

Well, I came by to check
if you've seen this man.

He escaped custody, and we're
worried he might come after you.

I'm gonna assign a uniform
to keep an eye on you

- until we can ap...
- You don't have to do that.

All due respect, I have a job
to do here, ma'am.

- I need to keep you safe.
- It's okay. I am safe.

We'll see you there.

See me where?

Alright.

It ain't pretty, but
it's gonna work.

I've gotta reset the electronics.

Something's wrong with the hydraulics
down in the nose wheel.

Is either one of
you guys mechanical?

Yeah?

I-I worked for a-a contractor
renovating apartments

- for a couple summers.
- Here, take that...

and this... and this.

Go down there, make sure
everything's hooked up right.

Go!

- Lapidus?
- Yeah?

Frank, how's it going over
there? What's your timetable?

Don't bother me!

Sounds like they're making progress.

- We gotta go now.
- I don't understand.

Locke's dead...
why is this still happening?

Because whatever Desmond turned off,

I need to turn it back on again.

But if it doesn't work,
if I don't get it done...

you all need to leave now.
You need to be on that plane.

You can come with us too, Jack.
You don't have to do this.

No, I do have to do it.

No, you don't.

Let this island sink, Jack.

Kate, I can't.

You think you can get that
boat across the channel in time?

Yeah, I can manage.

Good luck to you, James.

Thanks, doc... for everything.

James!

If the island's going down,
I'm going down with it.

Hugo. You better get going.

Unh-unh. No way. You
think I'm going down that?

I'm with you, dude.

Okay.

Kate...

you gotta go.

Get Claire on that plane.

Tell me I'm gonna see you again.

I love you.

I love you.

Can you fix it?

I don't believe
in a lot of things,

but I do believe in duct tape.

Yeah, I think we're good.

Let's get the hell out of here.

Yo, Chesty. It's Sawyer and Kate.

Yeah?

We're on our way
down to the sailboat,

then we're heading to you.
Don't leave without us!

We're gettin' off the ground

while there's still
ground to get off.

So if you wanna go, you better
get your asses in gear.

Lapidus! Lapidus!

- Son of a bitch!
- What now?

We jump.

- I'll see you at the boat.
- Kate!

Hey, you know where I can get
some grub around here?

Uh, the cafeteria's closed,

but there's a vending
machine down the hallway.

Thanks, doc.

Yeah, no problem.

Oh, come on.

Unbelievable.

Can I help you?

It's okay. I'm a...

I'm a cop.

Mm. Maybe you should
read the machine its rights.

- That's funny.
- Mm.

- Can I tell you a secret?
- Please.

If you unplug it and then
you plug it back in again,

the candy just drops right down.

Is that right?

Yes, and it's technically legal.

Oh.

I'll give that a shot.

Oops.

It worked.

Oh.

Whoa.

Did you feel that?

- We should get coffee sometime.
- I'd love to,

but that machine ate my dollar.
I only got one left.

We could go dutch.

Juliet.

Juliet, it's... it's me.

Julie.

It's me, baby.

I got you.

I got you, baby.

Yeah.

Kiss me, James.

You got it, Blondie.

It's over.

Excuse me?

The concert.

It's over.

You looking for someone?

Yeah. My son.

I was supposed to bring
him here tonight and then...

I couldn't come, and...

I'm sorry,

where do I remember you from?

I stole your pen.

What?

Um...

Oceanic 815...

from Sydney.

I bumped into you
coming out of the bathroom,

and... I stole your pen.

And that's how I know you?

No.

That's not how you know me.

I missed you so much.

Are you okay?

What is happening to me?

Who...

who are you? I don't...

I know you don't understand, Jack...

but if you come with me,

you will.

It's over there.

How we gettin' down there?

We're not. I'm going alone.

Dude, you can't go
down there alone.

Desmond didn't make it.
How the hell are you gonna survive?

No.

No way.
I'm not gonna let you die.

Hurley, I'm already dead.

- You said you'd protect the island!
- And that's what I'm doing.

- You're committing suicide!
- I'm not. This is the way it has to happen.

This is what
I'm supposed to do.

You're not supposed to die,
the island needs you!

Hurley...

it needs you.

What?

It needs to be you, Hugo.

I can't.

It's supposed to be you.

No, it was only supposed to
be me so I could do this.

But if someone has to
take care of the island,

if someone has to protect it,
then... then it should be you.

Hurley...

I believe in you.

Alright, I'll take it.

But it's only temporary.

As soon as you get that light
back on, I'm pulling you up

and I'm giving it right
back to you. Deal?

Deal.

- Do you have anything to drink?
- What?

Anything to drink out of?

- A-a cup. A canteen.
- I do.

Is that okay?

It's perfect.

Drink this.

Is that it?

Now you're like me.

Second time's a charm.

It better be, 'cause we sure as hell don't
have the battery power for a third time.

Is that good?

That, my friends,
is pure music.

Easy.

Easy. Easy.

Dude!

Desmond!

Desmond...

can you hear me?

Aah! Ah!

The light...

I put it out.

It didn't work.

I thought I'd leave this place.

I got you. Come on.

- Come on.
- Ah!

I'm still here.

You were right, Jack.

Yeah, well... there's a
first time for everything.

Aah!

Uhh! I have to put it back.

- It was like a drain.
- That's what you did?

You took that stone out
of that hole over there?

Jack, you can't. Listen.

Even if you turn it back on,
it'll kill ya. It has to be me.

Desmond, you've done enough.

You wanna do something? Go home
and be with your wife and son.

What about you, Jack?

I'll see you in
another life, brother.

Claire?

Oh, that ain't good.

Miles, go look out the door! You're gonna
be my eyes while I back this out of here.

Richard, go tell me what he says.

Claire!

Are you okay?

Come on! We gotta go!
Come on!

- Claire, come on, please.
- I can't!

- Why?!
- Look at me!

This island's made me crazy.

I-I don't want Aaron
to see me like this.

I don't... I don't even know
how to be a mother anymore.

Listen to me.
None of us do.

Not at first.

But you're not alone.

Let me help you.

Now come on.

Let's go.

- Are we clear?!
- Miles, are we clear?

- Yeah, it looks like it to me!
- He says we're good.

You better pray we are, Ricky boy,
'cause I'm gonna spin her around.

Hold on!

Sawyer! Tell him to stop!
Tell him we're coming!

Lapidus! Lapidus!

Lapidus, hold on!

All right, we're good to go!

Let's go!

What the hell?

Boys, we got some late arrivals.
Open the door.

Come on!

We're running out of time!

Way to wait till
the last second, Jim.

Good to see you, too, Enos.

We got 'em!

Everybody buckle up tight!

Hold on!

Here we go, Frank.

Come on.

Come on.

Amen.

He did it.
The light's back on.

Dude, pull.

Hang on, Jack!

Got him!

Desmond?

No.

Jack!

Jack!

Thank you.

Hello, Benjamin.

Hello, John.

Is everyone already inside?

I believe
most of them are, yes.

Mm.

I'm very sorry for what
I did to you, John.

I was selfish

and jealous.

I wanted everything you had.

What did I have?

You were special, John...

and I wasn't.

Well, if it helps, Ben...

I forgive you.

Thank you, John.

That does help.

It matters more than I can say.

What are you gonna do now?

I have some things
that I still need to work out.

I think I'll stay here a while.

You know, I don't think you need
to be in that chair anymore.

Mm.

Good-bye, Ben.

I think Desmond's gonna be okay.

Jack's... gone...

isn't he?

He did his job, Hugo.

It's my job now.

What the hell
am I supposed to to do?

I think you do
what you do best,

take care of people.

You can start by
helping Desmond get home.

But how?

People can't leave the island.

That's how Jacob ran things.

Maybe there's another way...

a better way.

Will you help me?

I'm sorry?

I could really use someone
with, like... experience

for a little while.

Will you help me, Ben?

I'd be honored.

Cool.

Oh! Hey, dude.

Hello, Hugo.

We're all inside.

I don't think I'm coming in.

You know...

you were a real good number two.

And you were a
great number one, Hugo.

Thanks, dude.

I'll see you.

Do you know where we are?

This is where I was gonna
have my father's funeral.

He died in Australia.

I'm sorry.

Why did you bring me here?

Because this is where you're
gonna have your father's funeral.

You can go in around back.

Wait. W-where are you going?

Inside.

I'll be waiting for you there...

once you're ready.

Ready for what?

To leave.

Hey, kiddo.

Dad?

Hello, Jack.

I don't understand.

You died.

Yeah.

Yes, I did.

Then how are you here
right now?

How are you here?

I died, too.

It's okay.

It's okay.

It's okay, son.

- I love you, dad.
- I love you, too, son.

Are you...

are you real?

I sure hope so.

Yeah, I'm real.

You're real.

Everything that's ever
happened to you is real.

All those people in the church...

they're all real, too.

They're all...

they're all dead?

Everyone dies sometime, kiddo.

Some of them before you, some...

long after you.

But why are they all here now?

Well, there is no, "now"... here.

Where are we, dad?

This is a place that you...
that you all made together

so that you could
find one another.

The most important
part of your life

was the time that you spent
with these people.

That's why all of you are here.

Nobody does it alone, Jack.

You needed all of them

and they needed you.

For what?

To remember...

and to... let go.

Kate...

she said we were leaving.

Not leave. No.

Moving on.

Where are we going?

Let's go find out.

We've been waitin' for ya.
