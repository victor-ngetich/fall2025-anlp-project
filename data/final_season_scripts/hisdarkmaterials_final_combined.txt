S03E01 - THE ENCHANTED SLEEPER
	Normal view	1.
Held captive in the hands of Mrs Coulter, a dreaming Lyra finds herself in a mysterious place with someone familiar -
Roger. Will continues with his quest to find Lyra, meeting unexpected allies along the way. Asriel journeys through the worlds in his recruitment drive for his war against the Authority. In Geneva, ‘Father President’ MacPhail meets a devoted young priest, Father Gomez, and sends him on a special mission.
I am Lord Asriel Belacqua. I am gathering the greatest from every world, from even the heavens above.
But I want you to help me wage my war.
Welcome to the Republic of Heaven, Commander.
          ROGER Lyra!
Roger! What is this place?
Roger!
You must play the serpent. Save the girl. And the boy.
What are you? Angels. Balthamos and I have been searching for Aesahaettr for you. You must come with us to Lord Asriel.
          WILL I'm looking for my friend Lyra. She needs my help.
          BARUCH She's with a woman who is holding her against her will. Balthamos will take you to her.
          MRS COULTER There are people coming for you. Dangerous people.
Father...
Gomez.
          GOMEZ I'm confident I can locate the girl myself. I will need to use methods that aren't officially sanctioned.
( Growls ) Stop!
You're looking for Lyra?
          WILL She's with her mother, being held against her will.
          IOREK Then we must go to her.
I know you didn't want to be here.
But without you and Baruch, I might never have found her.
So thank you.
Nearly400 years with Baruch must have mellowed me.
400 years?
You know where he is now?
Of course.
Angels can connect to any mind. But between us, the bond is even stronger. We feel as one, though we are two.
He's close to Asriel now.
You know what Asriel is going to ask of you?
My father told me about the war before he died.
He told me I have a duty.
There is a warrior in you, Will.
You overpowered the king of the bears.
And you'll find a way to protect the one you love.
          ROGER Lyra.
( Lyra breathes quickly )
Lyra.
Roger!
You have to help me.
I will.
I promise I won't let you down.
They're hurting me.
Who?!
Just tell me where you are and I'll find you!
The land of the dead.
Roger!
Roger!
Roger!
( Gasps ) Roger.
( Pan squeaks )
I was having that dream again.
We need to find him when we get out of here.
          PAN Where did you go?
I...
I couldn't follow you there.
The land of the dead.
          OGUNWE Oh, this is a decent set-up.
          ASRIEL Just a start, Commander.
Just a start!
          OGUNWE Very impressive, Lord Asriel.
But your soldiers, well, now they'll need some structure.
That's why you're here! Ruta! Welcome back.
Commander Ogunwe, allow me to introduce Queen Ruta Skadi of the Lake Lubana witch clan and her daemon Sergi.
She's a vital member of my council.
Commander.
Your Majesty.
Ruta, if you wouldn't mind...
You're well known to Ruta, Commander. She chose you.
Chose me?
Mm-hm.
I listen to whispers between worlds.
I hear things others do not.
We're assembling an army.
You and your resistance soldiers are some of the best.
I'm glad you approve.
We hope we can live up to our reputation.
We all hope that.
How much more will we need?
Of what?
This. Soldiers. Witches.
It's the Authority's strength that lies in numbers - the sheer wealth of people willing to defend his mysticism and dogma. We just need enough to provoke him.
So all this is just a provocation?
( Laughs ) Come. You'll see.
Find me the latest plans for the intention craft.
          SOLDIER Yes, sir.
How do you know this one won't kill you?
It will take more than a little crash to put an end to the pair of us.
Commander, you asked how many soldiers we were going to need.
The truth is, I don't know.
But the key to provoking the Authority lies not in men.
It may well lie... in Dust.
Asriel, you talk in riddles. I deal in strategy.
I'm not being clear.
We have to force the Authority to show his face.
And then... Then we're going to need all the fighters we can get our hands on.
I didn't mean to scare you.
What do you want?
I don't mean you any harm.
I'm just... I'm looking for someone. A girl.
Her name is Lyra.
Were you followed?
I don't think so.
Temple soldiers are in the woods.
I haven't seen anyone.
Something happened here a few days ago.
And now they're everywhere.
( Buzzing ) Come with us!
It's moving away.
Salt.
It burns the roots.
...Of these to the southern garrison.
( Fluttering ) And 250 to the western...
Lord Asriel...
Roke.
That'll be all.
          AIDE Sir.
What is it?
A message from our Magisterium spy, Agent Salmakia.
She says they're preparing to undertake a search mission.
For what?
Your daughter, sir.
They think she's the most important child that's ever lived.
Salmakia believes she's in danger.
When is Lyra not in danger?
Anything else?
No. There's nothing else.
          ASRIEL Very good.
( Fluttering ) You dismiss Lyra too easily.
You know what the Magisterium believe about her.
According to the Authority, Eve was the mother of creation.
Lyra is simply the creation of Marisa and I.
She is not Eve. She's a little girl.
She must have some information they need or some skill we've overlooked. Other than being able to read the alethiometer, she has very little, I'm afraid, other than a nose for trouble.
( Growls ) What?
What would you like me to say?
          STELMARIA The truth.
There are angels above the camp.
          OGUNWE What are they doing?
          ASRIEL They're fighting.
Clear the camp!
Not too close. Not too close.
Back away. Back away!
His chest is moving.
I'd say one of them fights for the Authority and one for us. Which is which?
I don't know. Maybe neither.
Ruta.
This one's higher status.
Could be an Archangel.
This one... I don't know.
Shall we see if we can move him?
Mm-hm.
You have him?
Yes, sir.
( Cries out ) Get back.
( Groaning ) Are you an agent of the Authority?
Please...
Say again.
There is a message I must give to you.
We're going to assume that one's with the Authority and this one with us.
I'll take him inside.
Sergeant!
Take him to the intercision field chamber.
Right, give me your message.
( Gasps ) We found the boy.
The bearer.
What boy? What does he bear?
Aesahaettr.
The god killer.
The only weapon that will destroy him.
Destroy who?
The Authority. What?
And his Regent.
My brother Enoch.
The Authority has a Regent?
Baruch!
How?
Who did this?
An angel.
We've already incarcerated him.
He's leaving us.
          ASRIEL Not yet.
Tell me where I can find the boy!
( Gasps )
He's on his way to Lyra. Lyra? Find him.
There is an angel waiting.
My Balthamos.
Find them.
Find the knife.
Balthamos...
Baruch!
I don't understand. It doesn't make sense.
What doesn't make sense?
What did they do to him?
What happened, Balthamos?
This is your fault!
You forced me to come here.
I wanted us to stay together.
I wanted to go with him!
They've killed him!
( Faint squeaking ) ( Fluttering ) ( Faint squeaking )
The messenger returns.
( Puts gun away )
He did not resist.
Didn't say a word. He just... stared at me. Yesterday I believed that angels were merely symbols, and witches were... villains in children's stories.
Yet here I am.
Mm. There you are.
Our kind have been to your world before.
Centuries ago.
The Temple would burn women they suspected of witchcraft.
I remember it.
Witches live for many hundreds of years.
Angels for millennia.
It gives them a power and perspective far greater than either of our comprehension.
I imagine they regard us witches in a similar way as we see humans.
And how is that?
Your lives are short and easily extinguished.
So then why do you fight with us?
Hope.
I believe there is a chance we can win.
And so... do you trust Asriel?
I'd stake my life on it.
( Door clangs shut ) You're awake.
That's good.
This chamber...
I created it for experimenting on Dust.
As such, it's lined with adamantine, properties of which include preventing Dust from escaping.
Now you, as well as my daemon, are entirely made of Dust, so you might find yourself locked in here for eternity. I am eternal. I have no concept of time.
Good for you. You'll be comfortable, then.
I'm going to begin now.
I'm going to ask you some questions, and you will answer.
What's the Authority so afraid of that he sent one angel to attack another? Don't want to talk?
Perhaps you're afraid of revealing that the Authority no longer rules in the Kingdom of Heaven, and that he has, for some reason, appointed a Regent. It's quite all right. I already know.
What's wrong with him that he won't rule?
Or is it that he can't? If he...
( Laughs ) Oh, now, that's interesting.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Do you know what else is interesting?
Dust. Fascinating stuff.
I've spent most of my adult life trying to understand it.
And I once killed an innocent young boy in order to harness it.
But no-one, before this moment... has ever tried to weaponise it.
( Cries out ) ( Gasps )
( Cries out )
( Yells )
Enoch. Brother of Baruch.
How did he become Regent?
Do not dare use that name! He is Metatron.
Metatron? Good.
( Cries out )
( Yells )
Asriel... Stop.
( Yelling continues )
( Gasps ) What does he want?
The end of this!
Dust is not for you to understand.
Conscious beings have become dangerously independent.
He will lead a permanent inquisition into every world, on every being, until they understand complete obedience. And with it, we will bring an end to the freedom of thought and will, and control Dust once and for all.
How do I find him?
The Kingdom of Heaven is not yours to enter.
You think you're significant?
He does not even know your name.
Were he to notice you, he could crush you and burn whatever remains.
Doesn't even know my name?
So this Metatron will require a little more coaxing?
And then will his kingdom come?
Good. Very good.
Wasn't so difficult, was it?
Didn't even take an eternity.
          GIRL Maddy's been here for nine years.
I joined a few years later.
You've been on your own all this time?
We have a life in the resistance.
We can read, write, learn.
All of those things are forbidden by the Temple, especially for...
Girls?
What about your parents?
Our father stayed.
He's one of them.
When we ran away, he helped us get out, but he wouldn't come.
He wanted us to join the Temple.
He thinks that we'd let the Temple turn us into braindead followers.
I'd rip their eyes out first.
She actually would.
Fair enough.
So... where's everybody else gone?
A stranger came here and... blew a hole in the sky.
And then Commander Ogunwe led everyone through it.
Like a window?
To another world?
Is that how you got here?
Something like that, yes.
But you decided not to go?
We can't leave him - our father.
I left my community once, too.
Long time ago now.
I left everything I'd ever known.
It felt like the world was ending. But now I can see it was just beginning to open up in front of me, full of strangeness and mystery.
I'd better go.
Are you going to another world?
A few more, I think.
I'm following these, erm... sticks. They're telling me where to go.
But... I know that sounds crazy, so I won't...
          MADDY Stay with us a while.
Who knows when you'll next have a chance to rest?
Go on, so...
          MADDY Tell us more about why you're looking for this girl.
Today... we have been offered an opportunity.
The opportunity... to purge this world... to purge these worlds... of all that has been ailing them.
We are going to release the righteous from sin.
Father Gomez will lead you.
And the Authority will guide you in your sacred mission.
Be swift.
Be brutal.
But make no mistake, the girl - Eve - must not be allowed to escape.
Retrieve the child.
Retrieve the mother.
And return them to me... dead or alive.
( Engine putters ) I understand that none of this matters compared to him.
I don't know what else I'm supposed to do.
( Chirps softly )
You know what this woman is capable of.
Balthamos and I will take a closer look.
You attract too much attention, so stay here and keep watch.
Do not underestimate her.
I won't.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm looking for a girl on this island.
( Faint whooshing )
Balthamos, you're going to scare her.
Yes.
Angel.
And this is Will.
This is Ama.
Ask her about Lyra.
Is there a girl here?
I care about her a lot.
          BALTHAMOS There was a girl here being kept asleep by a woman who claims to be her mother.
But no mother could possibly be so cruel.
This mother would.
Is that sun root?
It's a waking medicine.
Are you going to use that?
The woman has gone but will be returning soon.
Stay here. OK?
If you see her coming, run and get help.
Lyra.
          MRS COULTER You see, she's quite safe.
How did you get here?
Oh, these chambers, they have secrets.
She's not safe. You're drսg her.
Hmm.
You've grown, Will.
You know, I always suspected you were coming, but I didn't think you'd be the first.
It's impressive.
Why are you keeping her here?
Why won't you let her leave? Come.
Let's sit, hmm?
Tea?
Come on, I know for a fact you have tea in your world too.
Who else is coming?
Did you bring the knife?
May I see it?
Why are you keeping her here?
I'm keeping her here because I'm her mother... and I love her.
Lyra's in the most appalling danger, and here I can keep her safe.
( Sighs ) Please, sit down.
What could be more dangerous than you?
( Chuckles softly )
How sad you can't see the truth.
Three times I've seen her in danger... and three times I've tried to save her from it.
It's cost me everything.
And now she's in danger again.
Who's she in danger from?
The Magisterium.
And they intend to have her killed.
Do you know who they say she is, Will?
I know there's a prophecy.
They think she is Eve.
The mother of all sin.
And they think she will do great damage.
So they are determined to murder her as an act of devotion.
Unless we stop them.
Even if that's true, why are you keeping her asleep?
Because she hates me, Will.
If I woke her, she'd run.
In fact, she's already tried to run.
So explain to her, like you've explained to me.
I'm doing this to keep her alive.
Wouldn't your mother do the same for you?
A child needs their mother.
You understand that, Will.
You need your mother.
And here's the trick they never tell you.
Your mother needs you.
You know, that bond... it stretches, it transforms, but it never breaks.
Why?
Because the line from here... to here... matters more than any line in nature.
It's primal.
It's beautiful.
It overwhelms all other things.
If you let it.
Help me.
The three of us could be extraordinary.
Your strength, my guile, Lyra's bravery...
I'm not strong.
You are strong, Will. You think I can't see that?
You promise that you're keeping her safe?
That you'll carry on keeping her safe?
I give you my word.
Then I can leave her here.
Go to Asriel like I was supposed to.
N-No, no. No, no, no, no.
No, I-I-I need you to stay.
I saw what you did at Carlo's house.
We... we could help each other.
We could protect each other's vulnerabilities.
Will, we can't stay here. We have to keep moving.
You must come with us.
I gave my word to my father that as soon as I knew Lyra was safe, I'd go to Asriel, to fight.
I have to do that.
( Stammers ) Do you understand what you're doing?
This... ( Sighs ) This is a betrayal bigger than any I have committed.
If you abandon us now, you leave her for dead.
Do you understand that?
Thank you for what you're doing for her.
I'm going to leave her in your care.
Will, you're making a mistake!
You...
Wh...
I thought he'd stay.
          ASRIEL We are going to find that knife and we're going to use it to destroy Metatron.
You know nothing of him.
He is the Dark Angel. You cannot fight.
I can, because I must.
Ruta, this knife, it's the weapon you heard the cliff-ghasts talking about? Aesahaettr, yes.
Though I wasn't aware it required a bearer, or that it would have been the boy who was with Lyra.
So, we find Lyra, we find the boy.
          RUTA I have seen them together.
Where one goes, the other follows.
Who is this girl that everyone is so interested in?
Asriel's daughter.
They believe she is Eve.
Eve?
          ASRIEL Mm.
          OGUNWE Who is Eve?
          RUTA In some worlds, the mother of all sin.
          OGUNWE Your daughter is the mother of all sin?
( Sighs ) They believe so.
But they believe a great deal of fanciful nonsense.
And you didn't think it worth mentioning before?
Where is she?
We don't know.
And how will we protect her?
( Laughs ) If there is one girl in all the worlds that doesn't need protecting, it is Lyra.
Now, what I need is that knife.
The Magisterium can help us in this matter.
Roke, I want you to contact Salmakia.
Once she knows where Lyra is, I'll follow her there.
You would use your own daughter as a trap?
I've already risked everything I have to get us this far.
My fortune, my reputation...
But what we risk now, here, in the next few weeks, that will shape the course of history for ever.
So if I have to journey to every world, I will.
If I have to incarcerate every angel, I will.
If I have to take a knife to the heart of the Authority himself, I will.
And yes, I will risk Lyra.
I will risk my own daughter, because the alternative, Commander, is what happened to yours.
And I would risk everything - and everyone - to ensure that can never happen again.
So I suggest you all ask yourselves, what are you willing to risk?
An angel has been killed, and all you can think about is how that might benefit you.
Would you rather he die in vain?
Xaphania. The great betrayer.
You're consorting with humans now?
Was a millennia in exile not degradation enough for you?
You speak of betrayal... when you have taken orders to kill one of our own kind.
Baruch is - was - an enemy of the Kingdom.
( Laughs dryly ) What few rebels there are will not fight for you.
They are defectors.
They run away from conflict, not towards it.
They will fight for what they believe in.
Why have you really come to see me?
Perhaps you wanted to see if it is true... what Asriel has been doing to me.
Don't expect your rebels to follow a mortal who enjoys torturing angels.
Where is the Authority?
Hiding behind a Regent who cares for nothing but his own greatness.
The Kingdom as we know it has already gone, Alarbus.
This is our final rebellion.
What happened?
She's a liar.
And yet you're drawn to her.
I know what I'm doing.
( Distant humming )
Look. There is no time now. This is absurd.
Baruch died for a purpose, but this...
This is meaningless.
I promise it will work.
( Tannoy warbles )
          PILOT Five minutes to destination.
( Rustling and buzzing ) What is this?
It's a Gallivespian communication device.
We have a message from our agent in the Magisterium.
Lodestone resonating, go ahead.
Lyra is with a woman named Marisa Coulter.
Of course she is.
How close are they?
We're about to land on a remote island in the German Ocean. Fair Isle.
I know the place.
I'll take the intention craft. It's the fastest way.
Agent Salmakia, get to the children, get them to safety, away from the woman, then stay with them until I arrive. Understood?
Understood. You will go?
I must.
You heard what the angel said.
Aesahaettr - god destroyer.
Hmm.
In which case... try not to die.
( Chuckles ) The child is asking what you are doing.
I'm counting my steps.
We'll return by them in another world.
( Sighs )
( Golden Monkey shrieks )
( Horn bellows ) Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no... No! ( Mechanics whir and click )
( Clank )
( Craft powers down )
The intention craft works through clarity.
Your mind is muddled.
I know exactly what and who we're going for.
( Inhales deeply ) ( Whirring and clicking resume )
( Grunts ) Do your worst.
As soon as I've got to her, I'll come back through and close the window.
I need you to keep watch.
I'm sorry, Will, I must leave.
Balthamos...
It was one thing for the Aesahaettr, but this... this is a human matter.
Don't go.
I know this is hard for you, but I need you to trust me.
I can't. I'm sorry.
Not for this.
Balthamos!
Thank you... but go home, OK?
Stay out of danger.
( Horn bellows )
( Sighs )
Mrs Coulter?
That's me.
You're too late, Father.
She's gone. A boy got here first.
You know, he had several hundred miles and the boundaries between worlds to cross and yet... still managed to get here before you. ( Sniggers ) Bravo.
I don't know why I'm surprised.
MacPhail likes to think he knows what he's doing, but he prevaricates.
Dithers. Don't you think?
Ah! That was from the boy.
Surprisingly vicious little brat.
I am going to take Lyra now, Mrs Coulter.
And I'd rather not travel back to Geneva after nightfall.
Like I said... she's not here.
Please.
I'm sorry.
Her fate was decided long before I arrived here. OK.
She's in there.
Sit.
What was your plan?
Would you have kept her unconscious for ever?
Run from world to world, trying to escape the alethiometer... for ever?
No, no, it's stupid.
Quite the opposite.
You knew we would find her, eventually.
And destroy her.
That is her destiny.
You brought this fate upon her.
You gave her the terrible punishment of her existence.
And now, when she reaches the hands of Father President MacPhail... death.
( Father Gomez tuts )
Ow. Why have you been prolonging her pain in this way?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
( Exhales )
( Slicing )
I did not know what else to do, Father.
( Scoffs ) That is not true.
The answer was so simple, and you knew it... all along.
A truly loving act would have been to let her die.
To drift off in a sleep so deep that no-one could ever hurt her.
In her mother's arms.
( Whispers ) OK...
It is time for you to let her go now.
To kill one's own child takes a kind of strength I do not possess.
Oh, but you do.
You have greater strength than you know.
Will you do it for me, please?
Grant me that.
Hey. Hey, we're leaving.
Please?
( Faint snarling )
( Shrieks )
( Grunts ) Oh, dear.
Perhaps you were right about that strength.
You came back for us.
I knew you would, Will.
What are you doing?
We're leaving.
Well, I'll come with you.
We'll be safer together.
You'll need the two of us. No, no...
( Knife pings )
Stay back.
You're not coming with us.
She needs me, Will.
Please don't take her from me.
Please...
Just... just stay back.
Will...
Do you think it's that easy to dispose of me?
Get away from us.
Is that what you do, Will?
Was your mother as easily disposed of?
Where did you leave her?
( Slicing )
Where is she, Will?
( Slicing continues )
Where is your mother?
Look at me, Will.
Look at me.
Look at me.
What have you done?
What have you done?
          WILL You broke the knife.
Leave.
Without the knife, you're useless to me.
Please leave now, Will.
Leave!
Lyra, move. Move. Move.
( Whispers ) Move, move...
Don't look at me like that. Please.
Let me go.
Please let me go.
( Ping ) It was only a small sting. She'll be fine in a few hours.
Boy, do you have the knife?
Who are you?
I'm under instruction to take you to Asriel.
Follow me.
          LYRA No.
No, we're not going to Asriel.
It's OK. Come on.
This is a way out.
( Gunshots ) Whoa!
Get down.
( Roars ) Iorek's here?
I'll explain later.
( Roars )
( Growls ) Ah!
( Roars )
Whoa!
Get her out of here!
( Shouting )
( Gunshot ) Hey, are you OK?
Will, we need to go.
Come on.
Come with us.
Thank you.
Come on.
( Whispers ) Lyra? Lyra!
We're too late.
Damn.

S03E04 - LYRA AND HER DEATH

Lyra and Will travel to a dangerous place from which no one has ever returned. Mrs. Coulter tries to thwart the Magisterium's deadly plan.
ROGER
: ( Echoing ) Lyra!
          LYRA : Roger! Tell me where you are, and I'll find you!
          ROGER : The land of the dead.
          LYRA : When I was asleep, Roger spoke to me, told me he needed help, and I think we should go there.
You can't bring people back from the dead, Lyra.
          GOMEZ : I believe it will take more than man power to... eradicate her.
Dr Cooper, you have a service to perform.
Quite a thing to see you like this.
Hello, Asriel.
You are the only ones I can see who could help protect our child.
          LYRA : Will's knife broke.
I need it to go to the land of the dead.
          IOREK : The land of the dead is no place for the living.
Focus your thoughts!
Find what matters!
          MACPHAIL : I'm fascinated by what Asriel managed to do, inspired by your severing technology.
Could the energy be manipulated into some new weapon?
          THE CAVE : You must play the serpent. Save the girl... and the boy.
Are you ready to go to Lord Asriel?
          WILL : I have to go to the land of the dead. There's someone there who needs our help.
Thank you.
          MRS COULTER : An angel.
          ASRIEL : Come with me, and watch me start a war.
Marisa!
Go with her. ROKE : Understood.
Goodbye, Asriel.
( Scrapes )
          WILL : This is the last world I can find. There's nothing beyond this.
This is it.
Lyra, wait!
( Wind whistles )
          LYRA : Excuse me?
Is this the land of the dead?
          WILL : Just tell us where you're going.
          LYRA : It's like they're being pulled forward by something.
( Pan whimpers ) Pan, stop that.
( Pan whines ) What's he doing?
( Sniffs and coos ) This is what we were expecting.
Then where are everyone's daemons?
We've been in plenty of worlds without daemons before.
Just get in my pocket and we'll be fine.
There are people here who should have daemons... but don't.
( Pan squeaks ) Is he OK?
He's fine.
He doesn't seem it.
( Wind gusts ) Have you seen that before?
No.
Are we in the wrong place?
This has to be right.
It has to be it. Come on.
( Whooshing )
( Grunts softly )
          GUARD : Don't go in there!
( Weapons click ) Halt!
Oh. Hello.
Delighted to see you again.
Please tell the cardinal that Mrs Coulter is back.
( Snarling )
( Rustling )
( Tannoy chimes in the distance )
( Indistinct Tannoy announcement ) Good.
This is good.
( Buzzer blares )
MAN
: No, no. Stop!
Everyone, stop!
You.
Yes, I'm talking to you.
You aren't dead.
It was an accident.
We were being chased by some men and we just sort of found ourselves here.
If you're not dead, you're not welcome.
Listen, we've travelled a long way.
I need to find my friend before it's too late.
First, you were chased by men, now you're looking for friendship.
Well, you won't find that here.
Liar.
Go to holding area 32.
Give them this.
How long do we wait?
Until you die, of course.
Go!
( Buzzer blares )
What does it say?
This has to be the place.
We need to find the water and we need to cross it.
I do hope we sustained no lasting damage after our previous meeting.
I was simply trying to protect my daughter.
And you had such a lot to say last time we spoke, all sorts of beautiful words about escape and stupidity and mistakes - all words fed to you by the cardinal, I know. Father President.
I beg your pardon?
He's not the cardinal. He's Father President.
And they were not his words. They were mine.
Oh, yes.
I've known obsession like yours.
Have you?
I don't think you have.
I don't think you understand faith.
Father Gomez, you are a very young man.
Did you not think we knew you were coming?
Back to us.
Where you belong.
I find it very hard to judge what the Magisterium knows and doesn't know.
Its faith always seems to get in the way.
( Knocking on door ) Who?
It's Father Gomez.
I have with me...
It's me, Hugh.
Or do you only answer to Father President now?
( Knocking ) Come on. Let us in.
Come.
After you.
Mrs Coulter.
Is the boy staying?
Thank you, Father Gomez.
Good.
Then it's just the two of us.
You're under arrest, of course.
How disappointing.
For deliberate concealment...
There really is no need. I'm here to help.
You have prevented us from finding Eve.
If you'll let me finish.
I came here voluntarily.
As soon as I could escape from Asriel's fortress, I did. Look at my clothes, Hugh. I even brought you a piece of his technology, which I'm sure your scholars will be delighted to drool over.
All that matters... is the child.
My child.
The alethiometer was quite clear on who she is and what she might bring to us.
Are you still hurting yourself?
I made you cardinal.
I did that to earn your trust.
And in return, you have betrayed me.
I betrayed you?
She is... sin!
No.
She is the potential of it, and I wasn't unaware of this.
And I had my own solutions.
You had nothing of the sort!
To keep her safe until the danger passed.
Your lies are contemptible!
Then you came along and destroyed everything!
What danger... did you think you were keeping her safe from?
Eden fell not when Eve came into being, but when she was tempted. Somewhere out there is a tempter, a serpent, and I had to keep them from meeting.
I had her.
I had the boy. I had it all.
And then you sent your troops and scared them away.
I assume Fra Pavel told you about a knife?
A weapon so powerful it could kill the Authority himself.
I broke that knife.
It was I who tamed it.
So do not underestimate what I can still do for you.
Trust me to advise you, as I once did, concentrate on the battles that need to be fought and leave Lyra and her temptation to me. Is Asriel still actively searching for the girl?
She never held much of his interest.
The knife attracted him.
But now it is broken, he sees only his war.
And the way he is fighting, Hugh, it's... terrifying.
You know, I think I saw him murder an angel in front of my eyes.
An angel?
An angel came to Asriel?
Yes.
And he would hurt such a thing?
He would hurt anything that came into his path.
I tell you, there is madness upon him.
And that is why I came, Hugh, to give you what I could.
Then you are with us for the fight, hmm?
Against Asriel?
Against Dust?
You doubt me?
Sometimes, your devotion is hard to read, Marisa.
You have my mind... my body and my soul.
And I thank the Authority himself... that we have you leading the Magisterium and not Cardinal Sturrock.
He could never resist temptation.
Whereas you...
Your abstinence is magnificent.
Remember what we did together.
Our lives are entwined.
Papers?
Go to holding area 507.
Another holding area?
Not another holding area, no.
Holding area 507.
507 - that's the important bit.
Where is it?
Just ask.
Everybody's waiting, same as you.
( Lyra sighs ) Papers?
( Door opens )
( Clears her throat )
Good evening.
For you.
A peace offering.
And what exactly is that?
Does it fold out into a cage?
It's how we found you.
A kind gift.
Really?
Hmm.
Mother.
She was only too happy to help.
Of course she was.
( Door closes )
( Shouts )
( Breathes slowly )
( Golden Monkey coos )
( Sniffles )
( Chuckles softly )
She always had such grace.
Hello, Mrs Coulter.
Oh, you see, that's the problem with insects.
They get everywhere.
I'm the least of your problems.
Did he send you?
Yes.
I followed you into the intention craft.
So are you here to spy or to help?
What's your plan?
What? So you can relay my every move to Asriel?
I don't think so.
I can't.
My lodestone resonator was damaged during your escape.
Interesting.
So, in fact, it's you who needs me.
Hmm.
You intend to kill them before they kill Lyra.
And if they kill you first?
( Scoffs ) You risk yourself very easily.
What do you know of this place?
What have you seen?
Come on, you have no choice.
Without me, you have no intention craft.
And without the intention craft, you can't return to Asriel.
What have you seen?
I've been following Father Gomez.
He seems particularly interested in one room.
          WILL : Do we keep walking?
It feels like we should just keep walking.
          LYRA : They're staring, aren't they?
          WILL : Yeah, they're staring and saying nothing.
It feels like we're in a horror film.
          LYRA : Why would you want to watch a film that makes you feel horrible?
          WILL : You make a good point.
          LYRA : I liked the film with the bear.
Who are you?
We're travellers.
We're headed to the land of the dead.
Yeah, well, we're on the same path.
( Sighs )
Please - we don't know what we're doing, and you seem vaguely friendly.
We just really need to know what the rules are here.
( Sighs ) OK.
You can come in.
Thank you.
So...
Introduce yourselves.
Hi, I'm Lyra.
This is Will.
We won't disturb you any more than we need to, but we're looking for my friend.
He's in the land of the dead.
And we don't know if this is a part of it or how to get to it.
So if any of you could tell us anything, we'd really appreciate it.
Why haven't their deaths told them where to be?
Larissa, they've come to us for help.
Well, they shouldn't need it.
Talk to your deaths.
We don't have deaths cos we're not dead.
OK, take a seat.
You're not dead either, right?
All of you in the holding area.
Our death hovers close by and guides us.
We will welcome it.
We're ready, but... it's not ready to take us yet.
          WILL : What's a death?
They don't know anything.
Everyone has a death.
It goes everywhere with them... all their life long.
Isn't that scary?
          LARISSA : Not at all, dear.
It's natural.
From the moment you're born... your death comes into the world with you.
And it's your death that takes you out.
	There's love in that.	Gift baskets
Can you see our death?
No, love. Just our own.
Hmm.
When you're ready... they say it's beautiful. Your death says, "Easy now. Easy, child. You come along with me." And you go with them.
To the boat and the boatman.
That's what I saw in my dream.
That's where we need to go.
You're not going to get there without your death.
If you just tell us where it is, we'll stop bothering you.
We don't know where it is or what's on the other side.
No-one knows, cos no-one's ever come back.
The only way you're going to cross the water and go to the land of the dead is with your own deaths.
Invite them to you, in kindness and friendship... and they will come.
Breakfast.
I have no need of breakfast.
I must pray.
Where is the chapel in this citadel?
Mrs Coulter, you are expected to stay in your room.
No, I'm looking for the chapel.
I need to repent my sins.
You can pray in your room just as easily as you can in a chapel.
I find the Authority speaks loudest to me in his own house.
Well, if you wish to go to chapel, you must go at the allotted time.
Oh. Damn. Really?
Well, now that I'm here, you don't mind if I take a look around, do you? Oh... No, they're not very interesting.
If you won't stop...
You'll do what, exactly?
I'll fetch support. Good.
We all need support.
Go on.
( Chirps ) Morning.
Morning.
Dr Cooper!
( Gasps )
How wonderful... and unexpected you're still in employment.
In fact, how wonderful to see you alive.
I'm afraid I rather presumed you weren't.
Hugh MacPhail, picking up all my best cast-offs.
Now... what are we working on here?
Well, this is all restricted, I'm afraid, Mrs Coulter.
Dr Cooper, you have always been so kind to me.
I see no reason why you should stop now.
Well, you were always kind back.
Besides, the Cardinal Father President - and I hide nothing from each other.
( Whispers ) You need not worry.
Now, this is a resonating chamber of some kind. Am I right?
Ah, interesting.
You used part of our design for the daemon guillotine.
In fact, more than just a part.
Now, why would you be working on that still?
And... this.
What does it read?
It reads something which allows it...
Dr Cooper.
Are you building a bomb?
You don't understand...
Oh, but I do.
( Golden Monkey grunts ) Oh, it's directional in some way.
What determines its direction?
The Authority.
Well, that's not true.
Is it?
Oh.
They're here.
For me.
Not you, but you already knew that.
Ooh!
What a fascinating position we find ourselves in.
Gomez.
Lyra, what are you doing?
She said we need to invite our death.
Maybe if I get my head in the state it's in when I read the alethiometer, she'll come to me.
Be careful.
Wait. Can we talk about this?
Talk about what? We already decided.
I know, but summoning death...
Do you even know what that means?
No, of course not.
But we've come all this way.
Maybe this isn't the right thing to do.
But we are doing it.
It's what we came here to do.
          PAN : It's not too late to turn around.
With the knife, we'll find our way back home.
You were on my side.
I thought I was by your side.
Neither of you understand, do you?
I never got a chance to say goodbye to Roger.
I never got a chance to say I'm sorry.
All I want to do is make things as good as I can, even if I have to die doing so.
          PAN : Lyra.
She's here.
You're my death.
Yes.
Are you here to take me?
You wanted me.
I am here.
I need to talk to her alone.
I can't see who you're talking to.
Of course you can't.
She's mine.
Follow me.
I'll be back.
Don't worry.
( Breath trembles )
Authority...
Thank you for answering my prayers.
For delivering to me the means with which to win this war.
( Blade scrapes )
	Only through your love... and your guidance... will I find the strength to do what must be done...	Gift baskets
( Slicing )
...to lead us into salvation.
Follow him.
( Door closes )
The hair - we are certain this is the child's?
Fra Pavel is certain.
Is there enough of it, Dr Cooper?
This will be ample.
How soon can it be ready?
Matter of days.
Thank you, Father Gomez, that'll be all.
You are quite sure that, once set in motion, the bomb will find the girl?
Each individual is unique.
There are codes within us - anbaric pulses.
We use these... to aim this device.
The hair, wherever it might be, will want to be made whole.
It will be merciless in this pursuit.
No matter where the girl may be?
Whichever world she is in - forgive my heresy- the bomb should find Lyra.
Are you still here?
You keep appearing and disappearing.
I'm always here. I've followed you your entire life.
I am a special, devoted friend who's been beside you every moment of your life... who knows you better than anyone.
PAN
: That's not true.
Who knows you better than even you know yourself.
We need to make a deal. I'm not sure I can make a deal.
Look, I know I'm not deceased, but I need to go to the land of the dead, and I need to see someone there, and I need to get back. Could you help me?
Eventually, child, you will go to the land of the dead with no effort, no risk.
A safe and calm journey.
But there is no reason to rush there.
But I need to.
So does Will.
We both had people taken away from us too soon, and we both need to make amends.
Well, everyone wishes they could speak again to those who have gone.
Why should there be an exception for you?
Because... if you've been with me my whole life... you knew this question was coming.
And if you've truly been with me, you know the answer to it.
I've followed you.
I have seen your choices.
You saw him die?
Roger die?
I did.
I don't want to be exceptional.
Maybe once I did.
My parents.
That's all they care about.
I just want to be good.
I just want to help someone.
And Roger needs me.
And I wasn't there the last time he needed me.
Look at me.
Look at my heart.
Help me.
I will be your guide, Lyra Silvertongue.
	I will show you the way in.	Online TV streaming services
But once you are there... the other side is not my place.
So as for getting out again, you'll have to manage that by yourself. ( Heavy footsteps approach )
( Gasps ) Ngau.
Wait. Wait!
You're back.
Is she still...
Close by? Yeah.
What did she say?
Can you see my death?
You can't see his death, can you?
No. And nor will he.
You can't see your death until you're ready to.
Until it's time.
Only you can see your death.
When it's the right time.
My death's gonna take us to the water, if you're ready.
( Scoffs ) Am I ready?
I hope so.
I need you to be.
You take me to the best places, you know that?
( Exhales )
Cheers. Mm.
What else is there left to do?
( Fluttering )
( Ping )
( Whimpers )
          ROKE : You came here to protect her, but instead... gave them the fuse to a bomb.
Arrogance.
Sheer arrogance.
I underestimated them.
          ROKE : We must leave. Return to Asriel.
Once he knows what they're doing...
He'll do what?
He may...
He will intervene.
Will he?
( Chuckles softly )
( Golden Monkey grunts softly )
( Screeches )
You know you're right.
I did come here to kill them before they kill her.
And I will not let them have another chance.
We've already stunted their bomb.
We need to get back.
No.
Because they will find another way, then another and another.
This has to stop now.
We must find the intention craft.
What do you intend?
Destruction.
You're walking slower with every step, you know that?
It's not too late to change your mind.
I don't want to change my mind.
Mum used to have this phrase - nothing's fixed until you fix it.
Look, if you don't want to come, it's OK.
I can go alone.
I didn't spend months searching for you so I could wave you off at the gates of hell.
I don't think it's hell.
Looks a bit like hell, but it's not.
I just want to be sure you're sure.
I am.
Look, sometimes we do things, we get places, and we forget how we got there.
I know how I got here, Will.
And what if we don't come back?
Then we will have died doing something important.
( Will sighs ) Follow me.
Quickly.
          GUARD : Stop right there!
Hey!
( Alarm blares ) Stop!
Stop there!
          ROKE : This way.
The intention craft is just ahead.
( Dogs bark )
You didn't think I was having you watched?
You have no choice, Marisa.
You will still kill her... no matter what I do?
On that... I have no choice.
Then I have a statement to make.
I wish to stand trial for the murder of Cardinal Sturrock. A murder I conspired on with your Father President, a man who sins with every fibre of his being. Liar.
You know I'm telling the truth.
And I will make the same claim in front of the Consistorial Court.
You have no rights here!
You are a wanton woman who has always wanted what she didn't have.
Your husband was killed by your lover, the heretic Asriel, and your illegitimate child was abandoned until she became sin itself. I have changed. You have not, Hugh.
You need to be stopped.
Hugh? Who is this Hugh?
I am your Father President.
You will address me as Father President.
Or Your Grace.
Do you understand me?
I'm sorry?
This is where your loyalty lies?
Not with that above?
( Dogs snarl ) Not with truth, but with power?
You disappoint me, Father Gomez.
Get her out of here.
No. No, no. You cannot do this.
You call yourself a holy man.
( Dog barks )
How do you think your Authority looks on you now, huh?
A man of hate, surrounded by haters who worship you?
You pig of the cloth...
Stop her noise!
You disgusting...
( Muffled shouts ) This is all you really are - an incoherent, emotional woman.
Why should anyone trust you, hmm?
You can barely string a sentence together.
Such beauty.
Such true, enticing beauty.
And now I will give your beauty what it has always lacked, hmm?
( Spits ) Grace.
I don't know how you took the hair from us... but you didn't take all of it.
We still have enough left... for our purposes.
And when we sever your daemon... you will be the bullet... to kill Lyra Belacqua... and to save us all... from sin. Take her to the cellars... and bring her daemon to me.
( Pan sniffs and whimpers )
( Pan whines )
( Sniffs )
          BOATMAN : Good evening.
I'm so grateful to have you with us.
Leave all belongings and come on board.
Will he understand?
( Breathes deeply )
We need passage across the water.
Oh, I'm sorry.
One of your party is unsuitable for travel at this time.
Only one?
No, that's...
We have to follow the rules.
A pain, but necessary.
No passage. Not for him.
But he is me.
If you come, he must stay.
I don't think you understand.
If we separate, we die.
But isn't that what you want?
No, that's not right.
I don't leave part of myself behind, why should she?
Yes, you do.
Absolutely, you do.
It's her misfortune - or luck - to be able to see and talk to the part she must leave.
You will not know until you are in the water.
And by that time, fortunately or unfortunately, it will be too late for you to do anything about it.
But you must all leave that part of yourselves here.
The rules are very clear.
( Coughs ) We're going to get on the boat.
Don't worry.
Lyra, you're not listening to him, he won't let us.
I promise to keep you entertained as we cross.
Look, he can come on the boat.
He fits everywhere.
And we've always travelled together - no-one's ever had any problem with it.
So I don't see how you...
He can't come in the boat.
But if he does, the boat stays here.
Is this how it works?
I can pull it.
Only I can pull the boat.
Sorry.
We can't separate.
We can't.
Pan...
No! Pan!
          PAN : You're risking everything...
When will she see him again?
She won't.
And when we leave, will we come back this way?
I've taken millions across.
None have come back.
We will.
You don't know Lyra and you don't know me, but we'll find a way.
Another way.
So since we're doing that, be kind, Boatman.
Let her take her daemon.
          BOATMAN : It's not a rule you can break.
It's a law. Like this one.
You see? I can't tilt my hand to make the water fly upwards no more than I can take her daemon to the land of the dead. You might have to make an exception just this once.
( Scoffs ) How many ages do you think I've been ferrying people?
Do you think if anything could hurt me, it wouldn't have happened already?
Do you think the people I carry come with me gladly?
They struggle, they cry, they bribe, they threaten, they fight. Nothing works.
( Coughs ) I find it helps to be cheery and compliant.
I am both those things.
I encourage you to be the same.
I'm sorry.
I truly am.
But if she comes, she does so alone.
          LYRA : I don't want to leave you here.
We can still turn around.
But I can't not do this.
You can, Lyra.
What about Roger?
And Sal?
They never got a chance to grow up.
But it's not Roger and Sal, is it?
Roger's dead, and Sal's gone.
And it won't be Lyra and Pan. You're leaving me here alone!
What will I do?
But our dreams...
I didn't have those dreams.
They were your dreams.
I didn't even want to come here.
This is your choice.
But we're together.
Not if you do this.
Please.
I can't betray Roger.
It's my fault he's dead now. He needs me.
I need you, too.
Why can't you see that?
Where will I go? I'll find you.
OK? I will go to the land of the dead and I'll come back and I'll find you. I'm not leaving you.
OK? I'm not leaving you.
Not for ever.
Will and me, we'll find a way out of here and we'll go to Asriel.
Somehow, you've got to get there, too.
But I have to do this.
Then you've made up your mind.
You've chosen Roger over me.
Pan, please don't. Don't do this.
Oh, please... ( Sobs ) Please.
There's no other way.
I've got to.
	I love you.	Gift baskets
Just... go.

( Whimpers )

Oh! My heart!

S03E08 - THE BOTANIC GARDEN
Lyra and Will reunite with Mary and hear a story that changes everything. Now they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice if they are to save the worlds.
( Snarling )
( Rustling ) Pan?
          WILL Any sign of them? No.
You all right?
I'm not sure.
After everything we've been through, and now we're here...
It doesn't seem real.
Yeah.
In the tower, my mother's daemon...
I saw him disappear right in front of me.
I think she's dead.
I should be relieved.
There's so many things I don't understand about my parents. Like what?
Like why they weren't honest with me... why they did such horrible things.
Why wasn't she interested in me for 13 years, and then suddenly she was?
Why did they abandon me?
When I thought Asriel was my uncle, I idolised him... and then I hated him.
And now I can't forgive him, but... I don't hate him either.
Well, he won the war.
And we get to be here, so...
I have the strangest feeling he's gone.
Which means I'm alone.
No, you're not. ( Lyra giggles ) Oh!
What?
Nothing.
I'm just glad you washed, because you kind of stank!
( Both laugh )
          PAN She doesn't look like she misses me.
She seems... fine.
She'll be better than fine when she sees you.
Think how good it'll be to be with them again, to be close.
What if it doesn't feel the same?
What if it never does?
Lyra loves you.
We're finally in the same world.
We're safe here.
( Animal calls )
( Hooting )
That's not them, is it?
No. You'd know if it was.
( Alethiometer whirs ) It says our daemons are safe...
( Alethiometer clicks )
...but there's someone else we need to meet.
Pan's here, though.
It's like when he used to hide in Jordan.
I don't know exactly where he is, but I can feel him close.
I don't feel torn apart.
And I know he's safe.
( Squawking )
( Low rumble )
( Quietly ) Listen.
What is that?
They're riding on wheels!
Zallif ng zalif zai.
Hello.
Maeri e ia vakit ki.
I think it wants us to follow.
Dr Malone?
Lyra! I can't believe you're here!
How did you get here?
          MARY I was told to find you.
I knew I'd see you again.
Oh, my God, look at you. Hi. Hi. Oh, God, you've been through the wars.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Atal, thank you. How did you get here?

( Chirps ) Ungodly beasts.

Mea iru mil.
Nenga mil, vu zai.
( Chuckles ) Atal's so beautiful. I've never seen anything like her.
You know, a year ago, this would have blown my mind, but... now it's no crazier than talking bears and angels.
You must find this all a bit disconcerting.
I know I did.
We've been all over the place, but... I think this is my favourite world.
I've learned more being here in the last few months than I have in decades.
Atal has taught me so much.
Like what?
Like... how to trust my instincts.
How to treat a tree with respect.
How do you treat a tree with respect?
Well, you start off by not assuming you're better than it.
We have this stupid idea as humans that we're the pinnacle of evolution, but... we've got so much wrong.
I want to show you something in the morning.
Online TV streaming services
Is that what I think it is?
It's the answer to the question you asked me in Oxford.
Do you remember?
Whether Dust was sin?
Well, your Dust, my shadow particles - here, they called it Sraf, but it's all the same thing.
It's the spark that means we're alive.
It's consciousness.
So Dust isn't sin?
It's just as good or bad as we are.
Why do you have more Dust around you than Lyra?
It's the same with the mulefa - it comes with age and experience.
It's incredible.
How did you make it?
It's the seedpod oil that's the key.
They absorb it, and that's how they can see Sraf.
They evolved with the trees, this perfect symbiosis.
Everything was in balance, and then... something changed.
It's heartbreaking, isn't it?
The trees are dying.
Is it some sort of disease?
No, it's the Dust disappearing.
It's just flooding out of the world.
Thought, imagination, feeling - all blowing away. This beautiful place where the people are kinder and wiser than us by far, and... it's just dying.
What can save it?
Some way of drawing the Dust back.
In theory, Dust is drawn to thought, to creativity, so... some great discovery?
Atal says I can't think my way out of it, but... can't help but try.
( Faint whooshing )
          MARY So these daemons - what are we looking for, exactly?
Well, they look like animals, but they change depending on how you're feeling.
So when Pan's a wolverine, you know you've pissed her off.
( Laughs ) But they're a part of you.
Will thought he didn't have one, because he's from your world, but he does.
So do you.
I'm still getting my head round it.
Look, nothing surprises me any more.
This whole journey has been so extraordinary.
I've had to put aside everything I thought I knew.
But you believe in the soul, don't you?
I mean, you were a nun.
You were a nun?
Like a nun nun, from my world?
There are still nuns in our world.
So why did you stop?
Er...
Just... a lot of things all at once, really.
( Atal snorts )
Maeri, kanangeve.
Er, well, I was at a conference in Lisbon and I was giving a paper on particle physics.
My order were really supportive of my academic career.
It was my first time abroad and it had all gone really well and we were celebrating.
So... I suppose I was feeling a little daring. You know, honestly, up until that point, I really didn't feel like my life was lacking. And then... I met someone. She wasn't like the other academics. She wasn't interested in showing off how much she knew. She was just really easy to talk to. And suddenly, I was sharing things I never thought I needed to. And it just opened up this whole world of possibility, of feelings... I'd never experienced.
And then she gave me this sweet, this little sugary almond thing. And as soon as I tasted it, this memory came flooding back to me. And I realised... I had felt this feeling before. Years ago, when I was at school. Those butterflies in the pit of my stomach. That ache to be close to someone.
I think I had just been too afraid to recognise it before, but I didn't want to forget it this time.
I knew I couldn't go back to the convent after that.
I just couldn't bear the idea of living without ever feeling that alive.
And I thought, "Will anyone be better off if I just go back to the hotel "and say my prayers "and promise never to fall into temptation again?"
And the answer came back. No. No-one will. And I realised... there was no-one there to reward me for being a good girl or no-one there to punish me for being wicked. There was no-one.
And it was...
It was liberating. And it was... it was a bit lonely.
But I just knew I wanted to experience everything the world had to offer.
I wanted to experience love.
Gift baskets
And did you? Yeah.
Were you scared?
Oh, my God, I was terrified.
I was risking everything, and I was sure I'd be rejected.
But... it was worth it.
It's rare when it happens.
When you feel that way, you have to grab it.
It's funny, isn't it?
One little moment.
All she did was offer me a sweet, and it changed my life for ever.
For the first time, I was doing something with all of my nature.
Not just a part of it.
( Whispers ) Where are you, Pan?
There's so many things I want to talk to you about.
Eve was weak in body and mind.
She was deceived by the cunning of the serpent's tongue.
We will cut out that tongue.
We will...
( Spy-fly chirps )
( Fluttering )
( Chirps )
( Clicks )
( Faint whooshing )
Good morning.
Morning.
I've just brought you something to eat.
Thanks.
Morning. Morning.
I was going to join Atal and the others at the seedpod grove, but I can help you look for your daemons, if you'd like. Uh...
No. No need, I think.
I mean, we'll be fine on our own, right?
Yeah, fine on our own. Yeah.
Thank you.
OK.
          LYRA Bye.
          MARY Bye.
It's strange how Pan's here but he won't show himself.
Online TV streaming services
I hope...
You hope what?
I hope he's not angry with me.
I think he'll understand.
And she will, too.
My daemon, I mean.
What if she settles for something really bad, like... a mosquito or a slug?
Or a fish?
I heard of a man whose daemon was a dolphin, but he's a sailor, so it's fine.
Yeah, imagine me walking around Oxford with a dolphin in my hand.
( Chuckles ) You'll figure it out.
Oh-ho!
          LYRA Do you find it hard to answer Dr Malone's questions?
Seems impossible to explain what we've been through.
I don't think anyone can understand.
Apart from you.
She's great, isn't she?
Mary Malone? Yeah.
I really like her.
I think she's right about... a lot of things.
Yeah? What things? Er... You know. Dust. And, er... trees.
Trees?
Dust and trees.
          SPIDER DAEMON Lyra. Eve herself.
Imagine how blessed I shall be when I succeed where others have failed.
Praise be to the Authority.
          BALTHAMOS Stop!
( Rustling ) Who are you?
What... are you?
An angel.
We are on the same side.
No. We are not.
Come closer.
I am your servant.
Let me... perform this act of devotion, and you'll see.
What I'm about to do will rid the world of sin.
Desire is not sin.
Love takes a million forms - each of them beautiful, each of them worthy.
You who judge... you're just afraid.
I am Balthamos... and I will not let you take an innocent child's life!
Baruch...
( Dust rustles )
( Leaves rustle ) Will...
Is it Lyra and Will?
Yes.
The flow of Dust is slowing down.
Then the prophecy has been fulfilled.
The love of Eve shall heal the earth, and all the world shall feel it.
Gift baskets
Nature will be restored. Hope will spark in darkness. As innocence turns to experience, all will be in harmony once more. La, ia ki, zai mu...
They did this.
          LYRA We can go anywhere.
          WILL We can go to any world we want.
Or we could just stay here.
Do you think Pan knows?
I think he guessed.
We'll have to go back to our worlds for a bit, won't we?
So that they'll be OK.
I want to show you Jordan.
Proper Oxford.
( Chuckles )
Online TV streaming services
We can go to yours, too.
Go to the cinema again.
( Squawks )
( Sniffs ) It's Serafina Pekkala.
Have you seen how the world is changing?
It's all thanks to you and your humans.
One who has given the world such a gift deserves a name.
Kirjava.
Kirjava?
It suits you.
Why aren't you with Will and Lyra?
Are you still punishing them for their betrayal?
But you love them still, don't you?
And you are not severed.
No.
We're still one.
But it was so painful.
They will need you for what is to come.
( Sniffing ) Pan...
You left me.
I've had to travel so far to find you again.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so grateful.
I didn't want to.
I'm sorry.
Please...
Please. I'm sorry.
I've missed you.
I love you.
Lyra...
I hoped you'd settle as a pine marten.
It suits you.
I like it too.
I'm... Kirjava.
( Purrs )
Kirjava.
( Faint whooshing )
          XAPHANIA You played the serpent well.
Hello.
I am Xaphania.
And I'm grateful to you beyond words.
I'm sorry, do...
Do I know you?
We spoke in your laboratory.
I've been watching you and guiding you.
You've been so brave to come this far.
Thanks to you, the multiverse is healing.
I barely did anything.
You showed two innocents what it was to dare.
And by discovering their love, they have drawn Dust back into our worlds.
Gift baskets
Is that really all it took?
Something so small and... ordinary?
Love... is never small to those that discover it for the first time.
Your task is now complete.
The time has come for you... to go home.
Home?
I'm not ready.
XAPHANIA
For centuries, Dust has been flowing out of the universe. What Lyra and Will have done has turned that tide.
But their love alone is not enough to sustain it for ever.
Every window that exists must be closed.
Every window I've opened, I've closed.
There are countless more - windows left open by all the bearers that have ever been.
Each time the knife makes a cut, the flow of Dust increases.
And from the tear in the space between worlds, some darkness is released, bringing destruction across all of the worlds. It can take the form of many things.
A plague.
A Spectre.
I've been making Spectres?
But if Will can't use the knife and if we can't leave the windows open, then how will we...?
We have to choose worlds?
Will's or mine?
          WILL You can't live in someone else's world for long.
Our daemons won't survive.
It means... we can't stay in the same world together. No. You can't come here and just say that.
After everything we've been through, it's not fair.
It's not fair.
          LYRA I'll ask the alethiometer.
It'll know what to do.
I don't know what's happening.
It's not working.
Don't rush.
Just breathe, OK?
It's broken.
Come back!
          SERAFINA It's not broken, Lyra. You've... changed.
You've grown up.
So that's it?
I will never be able to read it again?
The knowledge still exists, but you'll have to learn it, like those before you.
You read it by grace, and you can regain it by work.
What's the point?
Why did we get here?
Why did we go through everything we went through just to be forced apart?
I didn't know it was possible to feel this bad.
It won't always feel like this.
I don't want to not feel like this about Lyra.
I only want her.
          LYRA You're a witch.
You must know some spell or some... some way to travel between worlds.
I'm meant to be with him. This is all wrong!
You know all those stories that say the greatest love is the one that you can't live without... the one that you're prepared to die for?
Gift baskets
That's not right.
That's not what love is.
I know it seems romantic to die for love, but it's much more romantic to live for it.
You will never lose what you have with Will.
You've shaped each other for ever.
And I know it doesn't seem like it now, but you have a future, Lyra.
( Sobs )
XAPHANIA
It is a great gift that you have given. But Dust continues to flow out of the worlds. Time is running out. If humanity set their minds to discovery and their hearts to compassion, they may create enough Dust for a single opening to remain. But you already know where that window must be.
The land of the dead.
We can't close that window.
It's the most important one.
Ghosts need it.
And now... the rest of the windows must be closed.
But how are there so many?
While the knife exists, only you can close them.
Break the knife, and we can help you.
I have to break the knife? Yes.
Once you've returned to your home, when it is broken, we angels will seal the wounds.
The worlds will be whole and unique once more.
If there's any way we can be together, just tell us now.
I'm sorry.
There are fates even the most powerful have to submit to.
I love you.
I'm not going to stop loving you till the day I die.
I love you.
We will come back here, though.
When we've lived our lives.
We'll go through the land of the dead... and we'll tell Gracious Wings everything we've done.
And we'll find each other... in there.
I'll be drifting about... until I find you.
And I'll be searching for you.
Every moment.
Every single moment.
When we do find each other again... no-one will be able to tear us apart.
We'll be joined so tightly...
Every atom of me... and every atom of you.
And when they use our atoms to make new lives... they'll have to take two.
One from you... and one from me.
We'll be in the flowers and in the sunbeams.
We'll be joined so tight...
( Mulefa trumpet ) We'll come with you.
Mil chetu e nafa ki, Maeri.
Kanangeve kana i ki.
Atal, you can't.
( Baby mulefa trumpets ) Once all the windows are closed, each of the worlds will be properly aligned.
But for now, Will, Lyra's Oxford should be here.
( Piercing )
( Birdsong )
( Cloister bell rings )
          MARY You will look after Lyra, won't you?
She has a lot of courage, but... I think this will be very hard for her.
I shall.
She'll be my sister now... for ever.
          MARY At least Will has Kirjava.
You know, you could see your daemon, too... if you wanted.
When you spoke to the angels in your cave, you held yourself in a special state of mind.
Like when Lyra read her alethiometer.
Exactly.
We all see only what we expect to see.
You only saw Dust when you believed you were able to.
Try it.
( Exhales )
( Chuckles softly )
There you are.
We can come back here every year.
You in your world and... me in mine.
Midsummer's Day.
Midday.
And I'll be there.
I'll be there every year.
My whole life.
And if we do meet someone we like... we must be kind to them.
We won't compare them.
When we come here, just for an hour... we can be together.
Every year.
I promise.
Just do it.
( Slicing )
I'll never forget you. I'll break the knife as soon as I'm through, because I know I'll just want to come back to you.
What is it?
I'm just trying to imagine what you'll look like when you're old.
( Both chuckle ) Handsome, of course.
Very. Lyra...
Will...
( Pan squeaks )
Just think of her.
( Faint whooshing )
( Gate creaks )
( Sniffing )
( Grunts softly )
( Muffled knocking )
( Bell rings )
( Bell rings )
          LYRA We can come back here every year. You in your world and... me in mine. And we can be together.
          WILL I'll be there every year. My whole life. I promise. Lyra...
