We have suffered at each other's hands.

We have lost people
we love at each other's hands.

This isn't about noble houses,

this is about the living
and the dead.

And I intend to stay
amongst the living.

I offer you a choice.

Bend the knee and join me,

or refuse, and die.

She is here to reclaim
the Seven Kingdoms.

The North is one of
those seven kingdoms.

The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

We need allies. Powerful allies.

The monsters are real.

Dragons, White Walkers,
Dothraki screamers...

Let the monsters
kill each other.

We will deal with
whatever is left.

We are going
to destroy the Night King

and his army,
and we'll do it together.

He pledged to fight
for Daenerys Targaryen.

He's bent the knee.

He needs to know the truth.

Jon isn't really
my father's son.

He's the son of
Rhaegar Targaryen,

and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

He's the heir to
the Iron Throne.

We need to tell him.

The same thing
is coming for all of us...

And it is here.

You should consider yourself lucky.

At least your balls won't freeze off.

You take great offense at dwarf
jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes.

Why is that?

Because I have balls, and you don't.

I warned you.

Northerners don't much trust
outsiders.

May the gods protect us!

Look at you.

You're a man.

Almost.

-Where's Arya?
-Lurking somewhere.

Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

My sister, Sansa Stark,
the Lady of Winterfell.

Thank you for inviting us
into your home, Lady Stark.

The North is as beautiful
as your brother claimed,

as are you.

Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.

We don't have time for all this.

The Night King has your dragon.
He's one of them now.

The Wall has fallen,
the dead march south.

As soon as we heard about the Wall,

I called all our banners
to retreat to Winterfell.

Lord Umber...

when can we expect
your people to arrive?

We need more horses and wagons,
if it please my lady.

And my lord.

And my queen.

-Sorry.
-You'll have as many as we can spare.

Hurry back to Last Hearth
and bring your people here.

We need to send ravens
to the Night's Watch as well.

There's no sense
in manning the castles anymore.

We make our stand here.

At once, Your Grace.

"Your Grace."

But you're not. Are you?

You left Winterfell a king
and came back a--

I'm not sure what you are now.

A lord?

Nothing at all?

-It's not important.
-Not important?

We named you King in the North.

King in the North!

You did, my lady.

It was the honor of my life.

I'll always be grateful
for your faith.

But when I left Winterfell, I told
you we need allies or we will die.

I have brought those allies home
to fight alongside us.

I had a choice,

keep my crown or protect the North.

I chose the North.

If anyone survives the war to come,
we'll have Jon Snow to thank.

He risked his life
to show us the threat is real.

Thanks to his courage,

we have brought with us the greatest
army the world has ever seen.

We have brought
two full-grown dragons.

And soon, the Lannister army
will ride north to join our cause.

I know, I know, our people
haven't been friends in the past.

But we must fight together now...

or die.

May I ask, how are we meant to feed

the greatest army
the world has ever seen?

While I ensured our stores
would last through winter,

I didn't account for Dothraki,
Unsullied and two full-grown dragons.

What do dragons eat, anyway?

Whatever they want.

Hey, careful, lads.
We need every last bit of it.

Sorry about that.

Are these the last of the wagons?

-Aye.
-Let's get it all to the forges.

My lord.

My lady.

My lady.

The Lady of Winterfell.

Has a nice ring to it.

So does Hand of the Queen.

Depending on the queen, I suppose.

Last time we spoke
was at Joffrey's wedding.

-Miserable affair.
-It had its moments.

Apologies for leaving like that.

Yes, it was a bit hard to explain

why my wife fled
moments after the king's murder.

We both survived.

Many underestimated you.

Most of them are dead now.

I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear
the Lannister army's marching north.

You have every right
to be fearful of my sister.

No one fears her more than I do.
I promise, you'll be safe--

Cersei told you her army
was coming north to fight for you?

She did.

And you believed her?

She has something to live for now.
I believe she wants to survive.

I used to think
you were the cleverest man alive.

You used to be taller.

How did you sneak up on me?

How did you survive
a knife through the heart?

I didn't.

You still have it.

Needle.

Have you ever used it?

Once or twice.

Valyrian steel.

Jealous?

Too heavy for me.

Where were you before?

I could've used your help with Sansa.

She doesn't like your queen,
does she?

Sansa thinks
she's smarter than everyone.

She's the smartest person
I've ever met.

Now you're defending her? You?

I'm defending our family.

So is she.

Yeah.

I'm her family too.

Don't forget that.

Your Grace,
I'm afraid I bring terrible news.

The dead have
broken through the Wall.

Good.

Why don't you just get it over with
and kill me?

But we're family.

The last Greyjoys left in the world.

The last ones with balls anyway.

If I kill you...

who can I talk to?

I've got a crew full of mutes.

It gets lonely at sea.

Are we in King's Landing?

You picked the losing side.

Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet
somewhere else.

But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.

Twenty-thousand men, is it?

Yes, Your Grace.
A few died in transit.

They cheated at dice.

Or maybe I cheated.

Someone cheated.

They weren't good fighters.
You won't miss them.

-Horses?
-Two thousand.

And elephants?

No elephants, Your Grace.

That's disappointing.

I was told
the Golden Company had elephants.

They are excellent beasts,
Your Grace,

but not well-suited
to long sea voyages.

In any event, you are most welcome in
King's Landing, Captain Strickland.

We look forward to fighting
on your behalf, Your Grace.

Am I most welcome here?

You are a true friend of the crown
and an honored guest.

Good.

As a true friend
and an honored guest...

I was hoping
we could talk in private.

After the war.
That was our agreement.

Wars sometimes last years.

You want a whore, buy one.

You want a queen...

earn her.

How?

I've given her justice, an army
and the Iron Fleet,

yet she gives me
no sign of affection.

My heart is nearly broken.

You're insolent.

-I've executed men for less.
-They were lesser men.

I hear the dragon burnt up
a thousand Lannister men.

Burnt up some of my favorite boys.

-Archie, was it?
-And William.

-Tall handsome William?
-Yeah, tall handsome William.

They said what's left of him
could fit in a wine glass.

I am the only man you ever met
who shot a dragon.

-Did you?
-Nearly killed it.

That's brave.

That boy Eddie...

The ginger?

That's him. Came back
with his face burnt right off.

He's got no eyelids now.

How does he sleep with no eyelids?

All right, can we stop talking
about the fucking dragons now?

Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

You're kidding me.

Apologies for the interruption,
but the queen did urge me to hurry.

Sorry, ladies.

Another time perhaps.

You ever get lonely,
I am partial to older gentlemen.

Poor girl. The pox will take her
within the year.

-Which girl?
-The queen's brothers

made promises to you and broke them.

Her Grace wants to rectify
their mistake.

She once gave me a castle and a wife,
then rectified me right out of them.

That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.

When Queen Cersei wants something,
she pays in advance and in gold.

Several chests of it, in fact.

Waiting for you
in a wagon just outside.

So she wants to murder someone,
but she can't send her soldiers.

If it's the Dragon Queen
she's after...

She has other plans
for the Targaryen girl.

Yeah, well, good luck with that.

Our queen's brothers are unlikely
to survive their Northern adventures.

But in the event that they do...

She has a keen sense
of poetic justice.

That fucking family.

When the Citadel expelled me,
I thought I would die poor and alone,

but in exchange for my service,
Queen Cersei made me her Hand.

What would she do for the man who
rids her of her treasonous brothers?

I wanted those elephants.

So...

how do I compare to the fat king?

You're insulting my late husband?

Are you offended?

Robert had a different whore
every night,

but he still didn't know
his way around a woman's body.

And the Kingslayer?

You enjoy risking your neck,
don't you?

Life is boring.

You're not boring,
I'll give you that.

Do I please the queen?

You might be the most arrogant man
I've ever met.

I like that.

But now I want to be alone.

I'm going to put
a prince in your belly.

Euron can't defend the Iron Islands,

not if he's in King's Landing
with all his men and his ships.

We can take our home back.

Daenerys went north.

Daenerys will need somewhere to
retreat if they can't hold the North.

Somewhere the dead can't go.

You're my queen.
I go where you command.

You want to go to Winterfell.

To fight for the Starks.

Go.

What is dead may never die.

What is dead may never die.

Kill the bastards anyway.

Welcome back, my lady.

If you'd follow me...

The Karstarks.

One of the better sigils.

Beats an onion, anyway.

Can't argue with that.

Not so long ago,
the Starks and the Karstarks

were slaughtering each other
on the battlefield.

Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.

And our queen is grateful.

Her gratitude is lovely,
but that's not my point.

The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow,
not to her.

They don't know her.

The Free Folk don't know her.

I've been up here a while,
and I'm telling you,

they're stubborn as goats.

You want their loyalty,
you have to earn it.

I sense that you're leading
to a proposal.

A proposal is what I'm proposing.

On the off chance
that we survive the Night King,

what if the Seven Kingdoms,
for once in their whole shit history,

were ruled by a just woman
and an honorable man?

They do make a handsome couple.

You overestimate our influence.

Jon and Daenerys don't
want to listen to lonely old men.

I'm not that old.

Not as old as him.

Our queen respects the wisdom of age.

Of course she does.

Respect is how the young
keep us at a distance,

so we don't remind them
of an unpleasant truth.

What is that?

Nothing lasts.

Your sister doesn't like me.

She doesn't know you.

If it makes you feel better,

she didn't like me either
when we were growing up.

She doesn't need to be my friend...

but I am her queen.

If she can't respect me...

How many today?

Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.

What's the matter?

The dragons are barely eating.

What's wrong with them?

They don't like the North.

Go on.

I don't know how to ride a dragon.

Nobody does,
until they ride a dragon.

What if he doesn't want me to?

Then I've enjoyed your company,
Jon Snow.

What do I hold onto?

Whatever you can.

You've completely
ruined horses for me.

We could stay a thousand years...

no one would find us.

We'd be pretty old.

It's cold up here
for a southern girl.

So keep your queen warm.

Don't be afraid.

-Gendry?
-He's here.

It isn't easy making a blade that big
with dragonglass.

You're saying you're good,
is that it?

I'm just saying
it's a tricky material to--

You know who makes weapons
for the wildlings?

Cripples and cocksuckers.

-Which one are you?
-Leave him be.

I heard you were here.

You left me to die.

First I robbed you.

You're a cold little bitch,
aren't you?

Guess that's why you're still alive.

That was a nice ax you made for him.

You've gotten better.

Yeah, thanks. So have you.

I mean, you look good.

Thanks. So do you.

It's not a bad place to grow up,
if it wasn't so cold.

Stay close to that forge, then.

Oh, is that a command, Lady Stark?

Don't call me that.

As you wish, milady.

Here's my wish.

Can you make it?

What do you need
something like this for?

Can you make it or not?

You already have a sword.

What's that?

It's Valyrian steel.

I always knew
you were just another rich girl.

You don't know any other rich girls.

Come in.

Lord Glover wishes us good fortune,

but he's staying in Deepwood Motte
with his men.

"House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

as we have for a thousand years."

Isn't that what he said?

"I will stand behind Jon Snow,"
he said.

"The King in the North."

-I told you we needed allies.
-You didn't tell me

you were going to abandon your crown.

I never wanted a crown.

All I wanted
was to protect the North.

I brought two armies home with me,
two dragons.

And a Targaryen queen.

Do you think we can beat
the Army of the Dead without her?

I fought them, Sansa. Twice.

You want to worry about
who holds what title,

I'm telling you it doesn't matter.

Without her, we don't stand a chance.

Do you have any faith in me at all?

You know I do.

She'll be a good queen.

For all of us.

She's not her father.

No, she's much prettier.

Did you bend the knee to save
the North or because you love her?

So you're the man?

Which man am I, Your Grace?

The one who saved Ser Jorah
when no one else could.

They could, they just wouldn't.

I'll have to make some changes
in the Citadel when I take my throne.

A great service
merits a great reward.

It's my honor to serve you,
Your Grace.

Well, there must be something
I could give you.

If it's not too much trouble,
I could use a pardon.

For what crime?

I borrowed a few books
from the Citadel.

And also a sword.

From the Citadel?

From my family.

It's been in House Tarly
for generations.

It would've been mine
anyway, eventually,

but my father had other ideas.

Not Randyll Tarly?

You know him?

I offered to let him retain his lands
and titles if he bent the knee.

He refused.

Well...

at least I'll be allowed home again,
now that my brother's the lord.

Your brother stood with your father.

Thank you, Your Grace.

For telling me.

-May I...?
-Of course.

What are you doing out here?

Waiting, for an old friend.

It's time to tell Jon the truth.

No, no.

You're his brother.
Shouldn't you tell him?

I'm not his brother.

He trusts you more than anyone.

Now's the time.

Sam?

I'm sorry, I know
I'm not supposed to be down here.

Were you hiding from me?

Of course not.

What are you doing in Winterfell?

Or did you read every book
in the Citadel already?

What's wrong?

-Gilly? Is she all right?
-She's good.

Little Sam?

Don't you know?

Know what?

Daenerys...

she executed my father and brother.

They were her prisoners.

She didn't tell you.

I'm so sorry.

We need to end this war.

Would you have done it?

I've executed men who disobeyed me.

You've also spared men.

Thousands of wildlings
when they refused to kneel.

I wasn't a king.

But you were.

You've always been.

I gave up my crown, Sam.

I bent the knee.
I'm not King in the North anymore.

I'm not talking about
the King in the North.

I'm talking about the King
of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

Bran and I worked it out.

I had a High Septon's diary.
Bran had...

whatever Bran has.

What are you talking about?

Your mother...

was Lyanna Stark.

And your father...

your real father

was Rhaegar Targaryen.

You've never been a bastard.

You're Aegon Targaryen,
true heir to the Iron Throne.

I'm sorry,
I know it's a lot to take in.

My father was the most honorable man
I ever met.

You're saying
he lied to me all my life.

No.

Your father-- Well, Ned Stark.

He promised your mother
he'd always protect you.

And he did. Robert would have
murdered you if he knew.

You're the true king.

Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name,
Protector of the Realm, all of it.

-Daenerys is our queen.
-She shouldn't be.

-That's treason.
-It's the truth.

You gave up your crown
to save your people.

Would she do the same?

Stay back, he's got blue eyes!

I've always had blue eyes!

Did you find anyone?

The Umber boy.

It's a message.

From the Night King.

His army's between us and Winterfell.
We're on foot.

We rode down from Castle Black.

We can double up on the horses.

If the horses last,
we'll get there before the dead.

We just have to hope
the Night King doesn't come first.

Keep moving! Straight up!

Stay together! Don't fall behind!

If we were up there,

we might see something
everyone else is missing.

Something that makes
a difference.

- [SCOFFS]
- What?

Remember the Battle
of Blackwater?

I brought us
through the Mud Gate.

And got your face cut in half.

And it made a difference.

If I was out there right now...

You'd die.

There's nothing you can do.

You might be surprised
at the lengths I'd go

to avoid joining
the Army of the Dead.

I could think of no organization
less suited to my talents.

Witty remarks
won't make a difference.

That's why we're down here,
none of us can do anything.

It's the truth.

It's the most heroic thing
we can do now...

look the truth in the face.

Maybe we should have
stayed married.

You were the best of them.

What a terrifying thought.

It wouldn't work between us.

Why not?

The Dragon Queen.

Your divided loyalties
would become a problem.

Yes.

there'd be no problem at all.

DAENERYS: We'll rip her out

- (WHIMPERS)
- MAN: Mind out!

Move.

We've been building
towards this for so long now.

You think back
to the very beginning

of the very first episode,

and it's beyond the Wall where
the White Walkers are stalking.

They're a group of rangers.

So, this is the culmination of
one of the key storylines

in... in the whole show.

And this is for everything.

We've been talking for
a long time,

how Night King's forces
have been growing in power,

and most of the living
have been kind of

openly disdainful of the threat,
and now there's no choice

but to fight it.

♪ (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

DAVID BENIOFF:
I really love the way

the first ten minutes or so
plays out,

because there's so much tension

before there's any encounter
with the enemy.

BOY: Come on!

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

BENIOFF: You know, as much as
they try to conceal it,

people are terrified,
because this is...

this is death coming for them.

You know, so much of it is just
kind of, on one hand,

setting the mood
for the episode,

and the other hand, showing us where
these characters are gonna be.

The entire episode takes place
in Winterfell.

And you have 19 or 20 characters
all involved

in a very chaotic situation,

that needs many, many locations
to service it.

BENIOFF: Because it's such
a long battle in this episode,

it's important that we feel
the ebb and flow.

And so, there are moments
when you think things

are going a little bit better
for the living.

Tell them to lift their swords.

We felt like it was important
to have that moment of hope,

when Mel comes in and lights up
their arakh,

and they all ride off
into battle.

(SPEAKS VALYRIAN)

(SOLDIERS GASP)

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

D.B. WEISS: We wanted
our characters to feel, like,

that this... maybe this is
all gonna work out,

maybe things are all gonna
be okay.

We've seen how devastating a Dothraki charge
can be just with their regular swords,

and now when they're galloping
into combat

with, uh, flaming arakhs,
it's... it's...

Uh... What could possibly
stand against that?

(HORSE WHINNIES)

BENIOFF:
What they see is just

the end of the Dothraki,
essentially.

WEISS: They have a plan,
and it's important

to wait for the Night King
to reveal himself,

and then have two dragons
against one dragon,

and a really good chance
of... of defeating him.

One thing that
they couldn't have foreseen

was Daeny's reaction to seeing
the Dothraki decimated.

Jon is the person who
wants to stick to the plan,

but the Dothraki are not Jon's;

they're not loyal to Jon,
they're loyal to Daeny,

and I think that Daeny can't bring
herself to just watch them die,

and so the plan starts
to fall apart

the second she gets
on her dragon,

so he does too,
and then we take it from there.

♪ (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

(SNARLING)

BENIOFF: We knew this episode was
gonna be almost entirely battle,

and that can get really boring
really quickly.

You can watch it
for a certain number of minutes

before the effect starts
to dampen.

Part of it was making sure that we
really stayed focused on the characters,

and so whether it's Arya's
storyline,

or Sansa and Tyrion
down the crypt,

or Jon Snow and Daeny
up on the dragons.

Kinda like all these separate
little battles within the...

within the greater battle.

- (SWORDS CLANKING)
- (SNARLING)

Lyanna Mormont was supposed
to be a one-scene character,

and then we met
Bella Ramsay,

and we realized that we would
not be doing our jobs

if we kept her as
a one-scene character.

My mother wasn't a great beauty
or any other kind of beauty.

She was a great warrior, though.

She died fighting
for your brother, Robb.

WEISS: We knew that
you can't give a...

a big death to everybody
who dies in this battle,

'cause it would've...
It just would've been too much,

but there...
Also, if she were to die,

there was no way to...
to not make a moment of it, so...

that's where the zombie giant
comes in.

It just did add a whole level
of complexity

to that moment,
that I'm sure a lot of people

would've been okay with
not having there,

if we had demanded to cut it,

but I think they also
understood why we needed

to give one of the strongest
smaller people in the show

a chance to go out
taking down

one of the strongest
larger things we've, uh,

we've ever seen in the show.

- (LYANNA SCREAMS)
- (ZOMBIE GIANT GROWLS)

(ARYA SHRIEKS)

WEISS: In any situation
where people are fighting,

Arya needs to play
a central role,

'cause she's one of
the best at it,

and she's one of the most fun
to watch doing it.

- (ARYA GRUNTS)
- BENIOFF: Even for Arya,

she can't take on a horde
of wights by herself,

and especially when her head
gets smacked,

she's no longer at 100 percent.

It's just about survival
at that point.

WEISS: Otherwise,
she's completely unstoppable,

and she never loses her cool,

and it's amazing, and it's
a lot of fun to watch,

but it's also... it's one note,

so we decided that almost rewinding
the clock on who Arya Stark is

to back before she became this sort
of magical figure that she's become

would really be interesting,

and would also give us a chance
to change up

the nature of the story
we were telling.

We talked about Winterfell as
kind of the home for the show,

and, uh, one of the things
that always struck us

as a horrific aspect of this
is that these hallways

and rooms where we spent
a lot of good times

and... and quiet times with
characters that we care about,

has now become a horror set,

because it's been invaded by
undead soldiers.

(SNARLS)

WEISS: Before that point,

there's sort of an agoraphobia
to the whole thing

where you have
this giant wide-open space

and everywhere you look
you... there's something

that could be coming
to kill you.

Once you get inside Winterfell,
everything contracts,

and the... the walls literally
start to close in around you,

and something is there
in the dark with you,

but you don't know exactly
where it is.

And we thought that
the pace change

and the tonal change
was really important

to have that in this episode,

otherwise the episode
would start to feel...

would start to feel monotonous.

Dracarys.

WEISS: We thought it was
important that,

whatever the plan was,
that it not just work out,

'cause that would be
kind of dull.

While there's no reason to know
for certain that

the fire wouldn't kill
or destroy the Night King,

there's also no particular
reason to believe that it would.

And then, a few moments after
this happens,

the Night King brings them
a whole new,

larger undead problem
by taking all of their own

who have been killed
in the course of this battle,

and turning them into the enemy.

BENIOFF: I mean, we talked about
various endings for Jorah

for a long time, but, you know,
you think about Jorah,

from the very first time
we met him, he was with Daeny,

and from that time,
he's been mostly by her side.

Part of Jorah's tragedy is

that he was in love with a woman
who couldn't love him back,

but he's accepted that
for quite a long time,

at the same time he was
going to fight for her

as long as he could
and as well as he could.

There'd never been a moment
where she more needed someone

to fight to protect her
than this moment.

And if he could've chosen
a way to die,

this is how he would've chosen
to die.

So, it was something we thought
would be powerful to give him.

- (DAENERYS SOBS)
- (DRAGON EXHALES)

BENIOFF: The reason
the Godswood was chosen

is because it's such
a source of power

for those who believe in the old gods,
and for Bran in particular,

so we know the weirwood tree
and the three-eyed raven

have a very deep connection.

That was always the location
where Bran was going

to be waiting
for the Night King.

I just want you to know...

- the things I did...
- Everything you did

brought you where you are now.

Where you belong.

Home.

WEISS: It's not like the show
is entirely about

people redeeming themselves
and then it's all over,

but if you... if the canvas
is big enough,

there are spaces for those
redemptive moments.

I think what was
really important for Theon

at the end was hearing
that thank you from Bran,

because Bran knows
what's gonna happen.

BRAN: Theon.

You're a good man.

Thank you.

He knows he's dead,
he knows he's not gonna be able

to kill the Night King,
but I think what's really heroic

about his action is that
we're all gonna die,

and we know we're not gonna be
able to defeat death at the end,

but, you know, it's... it's how
you face those final moments,

and he chooses to run
straight at it,

and I think he dies in a way
that, um, makes us

really proud of him and
the journey he's gone through.

- (ARYA SCREAMS)
- BENIOFF: For...

God, I think it's probably
three years now or something,

we've known that it was
gonna be Arya

who delivers that...
that fatal blow.

WEISS: She seemed like
the best candidate,

provided we weren't thinking
about her in that moment.

One of the great things
about having this many people

you care about
in a sequence together

is that it can kind of
pull people's attention

and focus to people that
they care about a lot,

like Jon, like Daeny,
Theon, and Bran,

not to mention Tyrion
and Sansa in the crypt,

so you're going
all over the place

with people who you're
desperately worried for,

and, uh, hopefully
you forget about the fact that

Arya Stark ran out of
that castle

with the battle drums playing,

going towards some purpose,

and we don't know what
until it happens.

BENIOFF: We hoped to kind of
avoid the expected,

and Jon Snow has
always been the hero,

the one who's been the savior,

but it just didn't seem right
to us, for this...

for this moment.

We knew it had to be Valyrian steel,
to the exact spot where

the child of the forest put the dragonglass
blade to create the Night King,

and he is uncreated
by the Valyrian steel.

At the end of it, it's still...

It's a victory for the living,
but at great cost,

because some of our favorite
characters fall along the way.

WEISS: We knew from
the beginning,

once we'd handed the outline in,
what we were in for.

The director, Miguel Sapochnik,
took what we were doing

and defined this episode.

Miguel did
a tremendous amount of

heroic heavy lifting
on this front.

He knew that if the planning
wasn't there,

we never would've ended up
with the consistent excellence

that he delivered.

It is to their immense credit
that...

not only that they endured it,
um,

but that they did such a great job
the whole time they were there.

WEISS: It's a real testament
to the entire Belfast crew

who gave us something that no
amount of money could ever buy.

Cersei's
followers will abandon her

if they know the war is lost.

Give them that chance.

If the city surrenders,

they will ring the bells
and raise the gates.

I'll find you later.

It's not safe.

Let me send some men with you.

I'm going alone.

In the name
of the one true queen,

Daenerys Targaryen,

I sentence you to die.

Grey Worm!

It's over.

These men are prisoners.

It is not over until the queen's
enemies are defeated.

How much more defeated
do you want them to be?

- They're on their knees.
- They are breathing.

Look around you, friend. We won.

I obey my queen's commands,
not yours.

And what are the queen's commands?

"Kill all who follow
Cersei Lannister."

These are free men.

They chose to fight for her.

Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

Jon.

We should speak with the queen.

Hyah!

Torgo Nudho.

You freed your brother.

You committed treason.

I freed my brother.

And you slaughtered a city.

What are you doing here?

Hey, what happened?

I came to kill Cersei.

Your queen got there first.

She's everyone's queen now.

Try telling Sansa.

Wait for me
outside the city gates.

- I'll come find you.
- Jon.

She knows who you are.

Who you really are.

You'll always
be a threat to her.

And I know a killer
when I see one.

Did you bring any wine?

No.

Ah...

Well...

thank you for coming
to see me.

Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
for long.

I suppose there's
a crude kind of justice.

I betrayed my closest friend
and watched him burn.

Now Varys's ashes
can tell my ashes:

"See, I told you."

It just occurred to me.

I'm talking
to the only man alive

who knows where I'm going.

So is there life after death?

Not that I've seen.

I should be thankful.

Oblivion is the best
I could hope for.

I strangled my lover.

I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

I betrayed my queen.

- You didn't.
- I did.

And I'd do it again,

now that I've seen
what I've seen.

I chose my fate.

The people
of King's Landing did not.

I can't justify what happened.

I won't try.

- But the war is over now.
- Is it?

When you heard her
talking to her soldiers,

did she sound like someone
who's done fighting?

She liberated the people
of Slaver's Bay.

She liberated the people
of King's Landing.

And she'll go on liberating

until the people of the world
are free...

and she rules them all.

And you've been by her side,
counseling her.

Until today.

Until today.

Varys was right.

I was wrong.

It was vanity
to think I could guide her.

Our queen's nature
is fire and blood.

You think our house words
are stamped on our bodies

when we're born
and that's who we are?

Then I'd be fire and blood too.

She's not her father,

no more than
you're Tywin Lannister.

My father was an evil man.
My sister was an evil woman.

Pile up all the bodies

of all the people
they ever killed,

there still won't be
half as many

as our beautiful queen
slaughtered in a single day.

Cersei left her no choice.

The moment the gates fell,

the battle was over.

She saw her friend beheaded.

She saw her dragon
shot out of the sky.

And she burned down
a city for it.

Ah, it's easy to judge
when you're standing

far from the battlefield.

Would you have done it?

What?

You've been up there,
on a dragon's back.

You've had that power.

Would you have burned
the city down?

I don't know.

Yes, you do.

You won't say because
you don't want to betray her...

but you know.

What's it matter what I'd do?

It matters more than anything.

When she murdered
the slavers of Astapor,

I'm sure no one
but the slavers complained.

After all, they were evil men.

When she crucified hundreds
of Meereenese nobles,

who could argue?

They were evil men.

The Dothraki khals
she burned alive?

They would have
done worse to her.

Everywhere she goes,
evil men die

and we cheer her for it.

And she grows more powerful

and more sure
that she is good and right.

She believes her destiny

is to build a better world
for everyone.

If you believed that...

if you truly believed it,

wouldn't you kill

whoever stood between
you and paradise?

I know you love her.

I love her too.

Not as successfully as you.

But I believed in her
with all my heart.

Love is more powerful
than reason.

We all know that.

Look at my brother.

"Love is the death of duty."

You just came up with that?

Maester Aemon said it
a long time ago.

Sometimes
duty is the death of love.

You are the shield
that guards the realms of men.

And you've always tried
to do the right thing.

No matter the cost,

you've tried to protect people.

Who is the greatest threat
to the people now?

It's a terrible thing
I'm asking.

It's also the right thing.

Do you think I'm the last man
she'll execute?

Who is more dangerous

than the rightful heir
to the Iron Throne?

That's her decision.
She is the queen.

I'm sorry it came to this.

And your sisters?

Do you see them
bending the knee?

My sisters will be loyal
to the throne.

Why do you think Sansa
told me the truth about you?

Because she doesn't want Dany
to be queen.

- She doesn't get to choose.
- No.

But you do.

And you have to choose now.

When I was a girl,
my brother told me it was made

with 1000 swords
from Aegon's fallen enemies.

What do 1000 swords look like

in the mind of a little girl
who can't count to 20?

I imagined a mountain of swords
too high to climb.

So many fallen enemies,

you could only see
the soles of Aegon's feet.

I saw them executing

Lannister prisoners
in the street.

They said they were acting
on your orders.

- It was necessary.
- Necessary?

Have you been down there?

Have you seen?

Children,
little children, burned!

I tried to make peace
with Cersei.

She used their innocence
as a weapon against me.

She thought
it would cripple me.

And Tyrion?

He conspired behind my back
with my enemies.

How have you treated people
who've done the same to you,

even when it broke your heart?

Forgive him.

- I can't.
- You can.

You can forgive all of them,

make them see
they made a mistake.

Make them understand.

Please, Dany.

We can't hide behind
small mercies.

The world we need

won't be built by men
loyal to the world we have.

The world we need is a world
of mercy. It has to be.

And it will be.

It's not easy to see something
that's never been before.

A good world.

How do you know?

How do you know it'll be good?

Because I know what is good.

And so do you.

- I don't.
- You do.

You do. You've always known.

What about everyone else?

All the other people
who think they know what's good.

They don't get to choose.

Be with me.

Build the new world with me.

This is our reason.

It has been
from the beginning,

since you were a little boy
with a bastard's name

and I was a little girl
who couldn't count to 20.

We do it together.

We break the wheel together.

You are my queen.

Now, and always.

Where's Jon?

- He is our prisoner.
- So is Lord Tyrion.

They were both to be brought
to this gathering.

We will decide what we do
with our prisoners.

This is our city now.

If you look outside the walls
of your city,

you'll find thousands
of Northmen

who will explain to you
why harming Jon Snow

is not in your interest.

And you will find
thousands of Unsullied

who believe that it is.

Some of you may be
quick to forgive.

The Ironborn are not.

I swore to follow
Daenerys Targaryen.

You swore to follow a tyrant.

She freed us from a tyrant.

Cersei is gone because of her,

and Jon Snow put a knife
in her heart.

Let the Unsullied give him
what he deserves.

Say another word
about killing my brother

and I'll cut your throat.

Friends, please.

We've been cutting each other's
throats long enough.

Torgo Nudho.
Am I saying that properly?

If it weren't for you
and your men,

we would've lost the war
with the dead.

This country owes you
a debt it can never repay,

but let us try.

There is land in the Reach.

Good land.

The people that used to live
there are gone.

Make it your own.
Start your own house

with the Unsullied
as your bannermen.

We've had enough war.

Thousands of you,
thousands of them.

You know how it ends.

We need to find a better way.

We do not need payment.

We need justice.

Jon Snow cannot go free.

It's not for you to decide.

You are not here to speak!

Everyone has heard enough words
from you.

You're right.

And no one's any better for it.

But it's not for you to decide.

Jon committed his crime here.

His fate
is for our king to decide.

Or our queen.

We don't have a king or queen.

You're the most powerful people
in Westeros.

Choose one.

Make your choice, then.

My lords and ladies...

I suppose this is the most
important moment of our lives.

What we decide today
will reverberate

through the annals of history.

I stand before you

as one of the senior lords
in the country.

A veteran of two wars.

And I like to think
my experience

has led to some small skill
in statecraft

- and underst...
- Uncle?

Please sit.

Well, we have to choose someone.

Um, ahem...

Why just us?

Um...

We represent
all the great houses,

but whomever we choose,

they won't just rule over
lords and ladies.

Maybe the decision about
what's best for everyone

should be left to...

well, everyone.

Maybe we should give the dogs
a vote as well.

I'll ask my horse.

I suppose you want the crown.

Me?

The Imp?

Half the people hate me
for serving Daenerys,

the other half hate me
for betraying her.

- Can't think of a worse choice.
- Who, then?

I've had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks.

About our bloody history.

About the mistakes we've made.

What unites people?

Armies?

Gold?

Flags?

Stories.

There's nothing in the world
more powerful

than a good story.

Nothing can stop it.

No enemy can defeat it.

And who has a better story...

than Bran the Broken?

The boy who fell
from a high tower and lived.

He knew he'd never walk again,
so he learned to fly.

He crossed beyond the Wall,

a crippled boy,

and became the Three-Eyed Raven.

He is our memory,

the keeper of all our stories.

The wars, weddings, births,
massacres, famines.

Our triumphs,

mm, our defeats,

our past.

Who better to lead us
into the future?

Bran has no interest in ruling
and he can't father children.

Good.

Sons of kings
can be cruel and stupid,

as you well know.

His will never torment us.

That is the wheel
our queen wanted to break.

From now on,
rulers will not be born.

They will be chosen
on this spot

by the lords and ladies
of Westeros...

to serve the realm.

I know you don't want it.

I know you don't care
about power.

But I ask you now,
if we choose you...

will you wear the crown?

Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms
to the best of your abilities

from this day
until your last day?

Why do you think
I came all this way?

To Brandon of House Stark...

I say aye.

Aye.

Aye.

Aye.

Aye.

Aye.

Aye.

Aye.

Aye.

- Aye.
- Aye.

Aye.

I'm not sure I get a vote,
but aye.

Aye.

I love you, little brother.
I always will.

You'll be a good king.

But tens of thousands
of Northmen

fell in the Great War
defending all of Westeros.

And those who survived
have seen too much

and fought too hard
ever to kneel again.

The North will remain
an independent kingdom,

as it was
for thousands of years.

All hail Bran the Broken,

First of His Name,

King of the Andals
and the First Men,

Lord of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

All hail Bran the Broken!

Lord Tyrion...

you will be my Hand.

N...

No, Your Grace,
I don't want it.

And I don't want to be king.

I don't deserve it.

I thought I was wise,
but I wasn't.

I thought I knew what was right,
but I didn't.

Choose Ser Davos.

Choose anyone else.

- I choose you.
- You cannot.

Yes, I can.

- I'm king.
- This man is a criminal.

- He deserves justice.
- He just got it.

He's made many
terrible mistakes.

He's going to spend the rest
of his life fixing them.

It is not enough.

Giving you to the
Unsullied would start a war.

Letting you walk free
would start a war.

So our new king has chosen

to send you
to the Night's Watch.

There's still a Night's Watch?

The world will always
need a home

for bastards and broken men.

You shall take no wife,

hold no lands,

father no children.

The Unsullied wanted your head
of course,

but Grey Worm has accepted
the justice of a life sentence.

Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,

but they understand our new king
needs to make peace.

No one is very happy.

Which means
it's a good compromise,

I suppose.

Was it right?

What I did?

What we did.

It doesn't feel right.

Ask me again in 10 years.

I don't expect
we'll ever see each other again.

I wouldn't be so sure.

A few years as Hand of the King

would make anyone want to
piss off the edge of the world.

I wish there had been another way.

Can you forgive me?

The North is free,
thanks to you.

But they lost their king.

Ned Stark's daughter
will speak for them.

She's the best
they could ask for.

You can come see me, you know,
at Castle Black.

I can't.

You think anyone will dare
tell you women aren't allowed?

I'm not going back north.

Where are you going?

What's west of Westeros?

I don't know.

No one knows.

It's where all the maps stop.

That's where I'm going.

You have your Needle?

Right here.

Your Grace.

I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

You were exactly where
you were supposed to be.

That's not... Uh...

What's this?

A Song of Ice and Fire.

Archmaester Ebrose's history
of the wars

following the death
of King Robert.

I helped him with the title.

I suppose I come in
for some heavy criticism.

Oh, I wouldn't say that.

Oh, he's kind to me.
Never would've guessed.

He's not kind?

- He...
- He what?

What does he say about me?

I don't believe
you're mentioned, ahem.

- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

We appear to be missing
a Master of Whisperers.

And a Master of Laws.

- And a Master of War.
- Yes, Your Grace.

Suitable prospects
will be brought to you

for an audience
in the coming weeks.

And Drogon? Any word?

He was last spotted flying east,
toward...

The farther away, the better.

Perhaps I can find him.

Do carry on with the rest.

As you wish, Your Grace.

Ser Podrick.

We serve at your pleasure,
King Bran the Broken,

ruler of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

Long may he reign.

That will improve.

I'm sure it will.

Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

Lord of Highgarden,

Lord Paramount of the Reach

and Master of Coin,

would you say the crown's debt
to you has been paid?

In full, my lord Hand.

Good.

Time to start incurring
a new one.

We have hungry people to feed.

Can we expect some assistance
in this regard?

Indeed we can.

Lord Davos, we have an armada
to rebuild and ports to repair.

We have. These projects
will begin as soon as

the Master of Coin and Lord of
Lofty Titles provides funding.

The Master of Coin looks forward
to helping the Master of Ships,

but first he has to ensure
we're not wasting coin,

or soon there won't be
no more coin.

"Any more."

You Master of Grammar now too?

Grandmaester, ahem,

it is my theory,
based on my years of work

on the Casterly Rock sewers,

that clean water
leads to a healthier population.

The Archmaester has done
some research on this subject

and it turns out...

The strong live
and the weak don't.

Find the best builders
and set them to the task.

Oh, speaking of builders,
all the best brothels burned down.

The Master of Coin is willing
to fund reconstruction.

Uh...
the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic

about the salutary effects
of brothels.

Well,
I imagine he isn't using them properly.

I think we can all agree that ships

take precedence over brothels.

I think that's a very presumptuous statement.

I once brought a jackass

and a honeycomb into a brothel.

The Queen in the North!

The Queen in the North!

The Queen in the North!

The Queen in the North!

The Queen in the North!

The Queen in the North!
