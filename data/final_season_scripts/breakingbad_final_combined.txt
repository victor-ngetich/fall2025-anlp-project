Mm-hmm.

Yo, so what's next?

We wait.

You don't got, like, eight more
anal things we gotta do first?

The reaction has begun.

Yeah, I... I know.

So how long?

Well, if we had a freezer,

the condensed liquid
would cool more quickly,

because, of course,

this is an exothermic reaction,




which means "giving off heat,"

and our desired product is...

Put me into a coma,
why don't you?

What did you just say?

What... what? Nothing.

Huh.

No, no, no.
Not in here.

Duh.
Like I'm an idiot.

Yeah.
Like you're an idiot.

Dick.

Ah, God. Jesus.

God.

Shut up.

Oh, wow.




Huh.

Bogdan... Bogdan says I'm not
doing the receipts right.

Well, he's got a bug up his butt.

He's... he's got a stick
up his butt?

He's got a bug up his butt
about the receipts, anyways.

So anyway,
he's insisting that I...

He's demanding
that I stay and, uh,

look over his system,

and I cannot get out of it.

Yeah.

Hello.

Hi, honey. It's me.

Hey, you.
What's going on?

Nothing much.

I... I was...
I was just, um,

calling to...
say I'm sorry,

but I'm gonna be late tonight.

Bogdan.
He's got a bug up his butt.

That's okay. I wasn't planning
anything special for dinner.

So...

In fact,
you could take pity on us

and bring a pizza home.

They're having
a two-for-one at Venezia's,

and at this point I could
eat a whole one by myself.

Yeah, yeah, sure.

I can...
I can pick up a pizza.

Hopefully Bogdan
won't keep me too late.

He better not.

Trust me.
He does not want to piss off

a hungry, pregnant woman.

Ooh.
What's that sound?

I just sold
your favorite piece.

The hideous crying clown.

Wow.

Yeah, and I got nine bucks
more than I paid for it.

Shows what I know about art.

Hey, what do you think
about Holly?

For the baby's name.

Do you like it?

I think I really like it.

Holly. Yeah. It's nice.

Let me think about it.

Just feels right, you know?

It's my new favorite.

Well, it's a front-runner,
for sure.

Hiyah!

Listen, I was thinking, um,

maybe we can have a little
family time this weekend?

Oh, yeah?

Yeah, you know.

Just take a drive.

The almost four of us.

Maybe we can head up
the Turquoise Trail,

stop at tinker town, maybe
grab some lunch in Madrid.

Oh, my God.
We haven't been there in forever.

I know.
So why don't we just do that?

Take a little break?

Sold. Sounds fun.

Holly.
It's growing on me.

Yep. Me too.

All right,
well, I had better go

and get this in the mail.

Why don't you call me

when you're on
your way home, okay?

Will do. Love you.

Love you too.

Ah.

Whoa.
Simmer down there, sparky.

What the hell
did we just walk into?

Hey, Uncle Jack,
I don't see Jesse Pinkman.

He was right here before.

- Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?
- No.

What do you figure?
He may be headed down that gully there?

That's the way I'd go.

Frankie, Lester, go find him.

Jack.

These guys are DEA.

No! Jack, no!

Jack! Jack! Jack!

No! No, don't!

Jack, don't. No.

No, Jack!
Jack, no!

Jack, no.
Don't kill him.

Uh-uh, back it up.

Don't kill him.
Don't kill him, Jack.

Get back here.

The hell not?
He's DEA.

No, he's...
he's family.

Say again?

He's my family.

He's my brother-in-law.

Didn't cross your mind
to maybe tell us

you had a DEA agent
for a brother-in-law?

Did you know about this?

I called you off, remember?

I told you not to come.

Well, it seems to me
we did you a solid.

You weren't
supposed to be here.

Too late now.

How's about you telling me
what was going down out here.

Hmm? Yeah,
you and your brother-in-law

don't seem to be
getting along too well.

It doesn't...
doesn't matter.

It doesn't concern you.

We just wasted
his partner here,

and he's wearing a bullet.

So, yeah,
I'd say it does concern me.

This is...
between him and me.

No cavalry comin'?

No.

You bet your ass
the cavalry's comin'.

No! No, no.

Jack.

Jack! No, the DEA
doesn't know about this.

Not yet.

Hank.

Nothing can change
what just happened,

but you can walk
out of here alive

if you just promise us

that you'll...
you'll let this go.

Yeah, I thought as much.

Sorry, man.

Just no scenario
where this guy lives.

No, no, no, listen!
I have money!

I have money!
It's buried out here. It's...

It's $80 million.

80 million.

So that's what got
this party started, huh?

But this money of yours
won't do me much good in prison.

You can go anywhere.

You can do anything.
Think about it.

You can have any future
that you want.

Jack.

80... million.

And all you've got to do

is let him go.

That's a hell of an offer.

What do you think, Fed?

Would you take that deal?

It's Hank.

His name is Hank.

How about it, Hank?

Should I let you go?

My name is ASAC Schrader.

And you can go fuck yourself.

Hank... listen to me.

You gotta tell him.

You gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.

Please. Please.

What?
You want me to beg?

You're the smartest guy
I ever met.

And you're too stupid to see...

he made up his mind
ten minutes ago.

Do what you're gonna do.

Pretty specific directions.

You know, most people
tell me to be somewhere,

they say, "West on the 40,

this or that exit,
second gas station on the left."

You know?

This here?
This is a whole other story.

That fancy phone of yours,

where does it say
this is exactly?

Yeah...

Look at this.
Even brought a shovel.

Jack.
No sign of Pinkman.

All right.

Says this is it right here.

So dig.

What's that? A barrel?

Couple barrels?

Jesus.

Hell yeah!

Oh, Jesus.
Would you look at that?

Hell yeah!
Goddamn.

Whoo!

What are you waiting for?

Yeah, boss.

Hell yeah.

Let me get on this side.

Out of there, man.

Oh...

Okay.

Pull a barrel off the truck
and load it in the Chrysler.

Seriously?

Jack.

That's, like,
10 or 11 million right there.

You sure you wanna do that?

You gonna make me say it again?

Go. Go. Chop, chop.

Jesus. What's with
all the greed here?

It's unattractive.

Hey.

Hey.

I'm leaving you a barrel.

Boys are gonna load it for you.

You got the keys
for these cuffs?

I'm sorry for your loss.

My nephew here,
he respects you.

He would never forgive me

if things...
went another way.

Also, I'll be honest,

you caught me
in one hell of a good mood.

So here's what's gonna happen.

You're gonna get in your car

and you're gonna
drive out of here.

All right?

No hard feelings.

Understand me?

We square?

Hey, man,
I gotta know we're square.

Or we're gonna have
to go that other way.

Pinkman.

Pinkman.

You still owe me.

If you can find him,
we'll kill him.

Found him.

No!

Get off me!

Get off!

No. No.

Good to go?

Hey, Uncle Jack.

Well, he was out here
with those feds.

Right?
Working with them.

Shouldn't we maybe find out

what he told them first?

'Cause, I mean, he had
to have told them some stuff

that might not
be too good for us.

And I'll bet we could
get it out of him back home.

I mean, I can do it.

Me and him, we got...
we got history.

And then, you know,

we'd take care
of the job after that.

Works for me.
Work for you?

- Let's go.
- No.

No!

No!

No!

Wait.

I watched Jane die.

I was there.

And I watched her die.

I watched her overdose
and choke to death.

I could have saved her.

But I didn't.

Hi.

Hello.

That truck belong to you?

It does.

I'd like to buy it.

It's not for sale.

Hey, Walt, it's me.

Um, just thought
I'd try you again.

We were just wondering
when you thought you'd be back,

so, um, just give us a call
whenever you can.

Bye.

Hey, Aunt Marie.

Hey, sweetie.

I haven't seen you for a while.

What have you been up to?

Oh, you know.
This and that.

Your mom and I need to talk,

so... thought I'd stop by.

Well, I, uh,
wish you'd called first.

This isn't the best time.

Well, Flynn looks like
he can hold down the fort.

Why don't we go
into your office?

I... I got it.

Okay, honey.
Thanks.

Marie, I have nothing to say.

Well, I do.

So you can just
sit there and listen.

I got a call from Hank.

He arrested Walt
three hours ago.

It's over.

"Dead to rights"
I believe is the expression.

Hank and Steve Gomez

are working with
a former associate of Walt's,

Jesse Pinkman,
whom I know you know,

and Pinkman has supplied them

with everything they need.

Hank is booking Walt
as we speak.

And I, for one,
could not be happier.

I almost didn't come here.

Christ, I barely
even know who you are,

and I sure as hell don't know

if I can ever trust you again.

And then I think about how
you were so upset with Walt

and how you wanted
the kids out of the house,

and all of this
makes me believe

that there has got
to be hope for you,

that whatever
he did to you can be undone.

All I know... all I have been
forcing myself to remember,

is that you are my sister.

And so I'm here.

Marie.

Everything changes now.

And you have got
to prepare yourself.

Hank will help you
as much as he can.

I know he will.

And... I will support you
through this.

But I have conditions.

I want you to give me

every single copy
of that obscenity

that the two of you made
to discredit Hank.

That DVD.
Every single copy.

You understand me?

Answer me.
Do you understand me?

Yes.

Good.

Now dry your eyes and get
Flynn in here, because

you are going to tell him everything,
and I mean everything, Skyler.

He deserves to know
the truth from his family.

Not a bunch of
uniformed strangers.

No. No.
No, he cannot... No.

You tell him. Or I will.

There's no way around this.

He needs to know,
and he needs to know now.

No.

Look, I gave you
what you wanted.

Come on.
Man, please.

Hey, please.

I told you where
to find the tape, okay?

Hey, just... just... just go.

Just... just go there.

Just go to his house
and get it.

We're on it.

Get it!

No one else knows about it.

Just me and his partner.

Okay.

No one else knows!
I swear!

Let's cook.

You're completely
out of your mind.

It's the truth.

It is, Flynn.

Then both of you
are out of your minds.

You're full of shit,
is what you are.

Both of you.

If... if this is true,

then how could you
keep this a secret?

I mean, why?
Why would you go along?

I'll be asking myself that

for the rest of my life.

So you're saying
all of this time

you were lying about this?

I mean, so you're saying...

you're a liar.

You... you just admitted it.

So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

Which lie is it?

Flynn, honey, your mother
is telling you the truth.

Right here, right now.
Believe it.

You know what?

This... this is bullshit.

This is bullshit.

I wanna talk to dad.

Your dad's in custody.

You won't be able to talk to him
for a while, sweetie.

I'm calling Uncle Hank.

I've tried.
He's not answering.

Probably because he is in the
thick of it with your father.

Honey, I know this is a lot
to process, Flynn,

but if you could just breathe.

Just try to breathe,
and just trust...

Really? Really?
Try to breathe?

Oh, my God.

Go home.

Just take the kids home, okay?
Go home and regroup.

I'll stop by later.

Flynn?

Could you put
your seatbelt on please?

Please.
It's not safe.

You're shittin' me, right?

If all this is true
and you knew about it,

then... then you're
as bad as him.

Whose truck is that?

Dad?

Listen.

I need you to come inside
and pack right now.

Mom, Aunt Marie, they said
that you were arrested?

No, just...

They say that you're
some kind of drug dealer?

No, just come inside,
please. Now.

Come inside. Come on.

Go, go, go, go.

Dad, stop.
Just talk to me please.

Our priority
right now is to pack.

Uncle Hank,
they said he arrested you?

I will discuss
all of this later, okay?

Just tell me what...

Just listen to me!

I need you to go
into your bedroom right now

and grab anything
that's important.

You understand?
Go. Now.

Both of you.
Go.

Walt.

Why are you here?

Skyler, please,
will you just go get your things?

For you and the kids.
Right now.

This is our priority.

Hank had you in custody.

- He wouldn't just let you go.
- I...

Where is he?

- I...
- Where's Hank?

I...

I negotiated...

Negotiated?

Uh, yes.

What does that mean?

It means...

we're fine, okay?

We are. We're fine.

Everything is gonna be fine,

but we need to leave right now.

All right?
Can we do that?

What happened?

Where is Hank?

Why do we need to leave?

I need both of you to trust me.

Right now, okay?

Please just work with me here

and I promise I will explain
everything later, okay?

Where... is... Hank?

Skyler.

I have $11 million in cash

right outside.

We can have a fresh start.

Whole new lives.

All we have to do is go.

We have to go right now.

That's all we have to do.

You killed him.

You killed Hank.

What?

No. No. No.

You killed him.

No, no. No!

I tried to save him.

Uncle Hank
is dead? I...

Mom, it can't be true.

- Just stop, please.
- It just can't be true.

Everything... everything
is gonna be okay.

Everything's gonna be fine.
I promise you.

But we need to leave right now.

Dad, what's going on?
Talk to me.

Just stop for one second.

Look, I told you
to get your things.

Stop walking away.

There is no time

tell me about Uncle Hank.

No, just drop it!

But... what's wrong
with you?

We're going.
We're going right now.

You have to tell me.
Dad, wait.

What happened to Uncle Hank?
What...

Get out.

Skyler, I promise you,
we will figure this out.

Enough.

Mom, what are you doing?

Skyler,
put the knife down please.

I promise you,
everything...

Don't say one more word.

Get out of here.
Now.

Skyler.

Get out.

Aah!

Stop it. Just stop!

Let go! Let go!

- Get away from us!
- Let go!

Dad! Stop, that's hurting her!

Stop it! Stop!

Mom, stop it.

Stop, dad.

Stop it now. Stop. Stop.

Just please stop!

Aah!

Stop! Stop it!

What the hell
is wrong with you!

We're a family!

We're a family.

What are you doing?

What are you doing?

Yeah,
I... I need the police.

My dad, he pulled
a knife on my mom.

He attacked her.
He's dangerous.

I... I think he might
have killed somebody.

Yeah.

He's still...
he's still here.

Yeah, he's...
he's still in the house.

We're at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

308 Negra Arroyo Lane!
You've gotta come quick.

Hurry.
Oh, God, no!

Oh, my God. No.

Walt, no!

Walt! Walt! Please, no!

No! No! No!

Walt, no! Let her go!

You can't take her!

Let her go, please!

You can't take her!

Let her go!

Walt!

Please, no!

Walt, no!
Walt, please!

Walt! No!

Walt, please, no!

Walt! Please! Please, stop!

Walt!

Say "da-da."

Da-da.
You say "da-da"?

There.

Get rid of that
stinky old diaper, huh?

Don't be sad.

Where's your belly button?

Where's your belly button?

There.

Now don't you feel better?

You're all nice and dry.

Huh? That feels good?

Oh, I know.
You were so wet and so cranky,

but now you feel better,
don't you?

Next order of business

is to get you
a brand-new car seat.

Won't that be nice, Holly?

Mamama.

Mama... ma.

Mama.

Mama.

Mamama.

Mamama.

Mamama.

Mama.

Confirming the abduction.

Amber Alert.
Holly White.

Female. 18 months.

Blond hair, blue eyes.

Last seen wearing
a pink and white jacket...

abductor is the father...

He was in handcuffs.

Hank had him in handcuffs.

Gold, wire-framed glasses.

Are you expecting a call?

Hi, you've reached the White family.

Please, leave a message.

Skyler, it's me.

Pick up. Pick up.

That's him.
That's my husband.

I need you
to pick up the phone.

- Start tracing the landline.
- Skyler...

- The number's 505-177-8987.
- I know you're there, so pick it up.

Skyler?

- Need the location of an incoming caller.
- You hear me?

Answer the pho...

Walt. Where's Holly?

Are you alone?

No police?

No.

No police.

Where are you?

Where's Holly?

Walt!

What the hell
is wrong with you?

Why can't you do
one thing I say?

What?

This is your fault.

This is what comes
of your disrespect.

I told you, Skyler.

I warned you for a solid year.

You cross me,
there will be consequences.

What part of that
didn't you understand?

You took my child.

'Cause you need to learn.

You bring her back.

Maybe now you'll listen.

Maybe now you'll use
your damn head.

You know,
you never believed in me.

You were never grateful
for anything I did for this family.

"Oh, no. Walt.
Walt, you have to stop.

You have to stop this.
It's immoral. It's illegal.

Someone might get hurt."

You're always whining
and complaining

about how I make my money,

just dragging me down.

While I do everything.

And now...

now you tell my son what I do

after I've told you
and told you

to keep your damn mouth shut.

You stupid bitch.

How dare you?

I'm sorry.

You, you have no right

to discuss anything
about what I do.

Oh, what... what the hell
do you know about it anyway?

Nothing. I built this.

Me. Me alone.
Nobody else!

You're right.

You're right.

You mark my words, Skyler.

Tow the line,

or you will wind up
just like Hank.

Walt.

Tell me what happened.

Where is Hank?

Please.

We need to know.

You're never gonna
see Hank again.

He crossed me.

You think about that.

Family or no.

You let that sink in.

Walt.

I just want Holly back.

Please, Walt.

Just come home.

I've still got things
left to do.

Hey.

Granite State (Script)
Created by: Vince Gilligan Starring: Bryan Cranston Anna Gunn Aaron Paul Dean Norris Betsy Brandt RJ Mitte Bob Odenkirk Laura Fraser Jesse Plemons Guest Starring: Emily Rios Michael Bowen Kevin Rankin… Read More 
Title: Granite State

*Van pulls into parking lot of Best Quality Vacuum store. The extractor walks out and opens the garage door. He opens the van door*

The extractor: You can come on out.

*Saul steps out of the van carrying three suitcases*

Saul: It's an actual store.

The extractor: Mmhmm.

Saul: I guess I figured "vacuum cleaner repair" was a term of art.

*The extractor pulls down a blue background*

The extractor: If you would step right here on this blue spot, leave your luggage where it is for the moment.

*Saul walks over to the blue spot and fixes his hair*

Saul: That good?

The extractor: Sure.

Saul: Yeah, what about this? *points to nose*
The extractor: I'll photoshop that out.

Saul: Nebraska? What's in Nebraska?

The extractor: You. From now on. It's gonna take me some time to get your new situation fixed, until then you're gonna be staying here. I got a place downstairs, out of sight. It's not the Ritz-Carlton, but it's comfortable enough for short-term.

Saul: How short-term?

The extractor: Considering you've got your face up on buses and billboards all over town, I'm thinking two days. Maybe three. Only thing is, and I don't like to do this, but you'll have a bunkmate.

Saul: Oh, yeah, he's still here?

The extractor: For the moment. He's a special case, gonna take some doing.

Saul: How's he holdin' up?

The extractor: *turns on TV* You be the judge.

*Saul bends down to look at the TV. Walt is pacing the room angrily*

ASAC Ramey: *to Marie* We will find Hank. Steve too. They're out there and we're gonna find them. You have my word.

Agent: Sir.

*ASAC Ramey and the other agent get out of the car. The house appears to be broken into*
ASAC Ramey: *to other agent in car* Call it in and get her out of here. Move.

*Both ASAC Ramey and the other agent enter the house. Things are broken on the ground and all over the house as if someone were looking for something*

Jesse: *on video recording* I get to his door and I could hear music inside. Like, squeaky voices. And I thought, you know, maybe, I knocked on his door. The music stopped and he was right there. When he saw the gun, um, he thought. I don't know what he thought, he was just so scared.

Jack: Hey, Kenny, does this pussy cry through the entire thing? *laughs*

Kenny: Just watch.

Jesse: *on video recording* He kept saying that, you know you don't have to do this. His eyes were so big.

*Kenny fast-forwards the video*

Neo-Nazi: Such a bitch. He won't quit.

Jesse: *on video recording* Then we turn around and there is this kid on a dirt bike looking at us. Drew Sharp, that kid that went missing up in Whitehorse. And then out of nowhere, Todd, that Opie, dead-eyed piece of shit, pulls out a gun and shoots the kid.

Hank: *on video recording* And this is Todd Alquist we're talking about? He killed Drew Sharp?

Jesse: *on video recording* Boom. Like it was nothing.

*Kenny pauses the tape. Todd looks over with a big smile on his face. Jack leaves the house upset with a gun in his hand*

Todd: Uncle Jack. Hold up. Now, I think we should keep him for a while and get a couple cooks under our belt.
Jack: You seriously giving me this turn-the-other-cheek crap? He ratted you out, personally.

Todd: Well, we've still got 600 gallons of methylamine.

Jack: Meth? Who gives a shit about meth? We won the lottery here. We've got all the money in the world. You're talking to me about selling crank?

Todd: Well, this is millions, Uncle Jack. No matter how much you got, how do you turn your back on more?

Jack: You little son of a bitch.

*Jack grabs Todd playfully, laughing*

Jack: It's that Lydia woman, you're sweet on her, you little bastard. Hey, Kenny, you believe this?

Kenny: Hey, it's all about this right here, huh? *laughs*

Jack: Come on, you can do better! I mean, that one's so uptight she's probably got a wood-chipper for a coochie. Stick in down there you're pulling back a stump. *laughs* Aw, what the hell. The heart wants what the heart wants, right? Let's go watch some more of that cry baby rat, huh?

*They all go back into the house. Jesse is sitting in the pit holding the picture of Andrea and Brock. He pulls off the paperclip and uses it to try to break free of his handcuffs*

The extractor: How thick is it? This is mild steel? Uh huh. No, this would be cash.

*Walt is writing on a notepad while Saul stares at him. Walt takes a break to rub his injured hand. He looks over at Saul*

Walt: What?

Saul: Nothing.

Walt: Look, you know what. Make yourself useful. Give me a list of hitters, mercenaries. Yes, yes, I remember, you've got concerns. Don't worry, we'll take the time to vet them. Make sure there are no undercover cops on the team. Five should do it, providing they are the right men for the job.

Saul: I'm gonna hate myself for asking, but, uh, who are we hitting?

Walt: Jack Welker and his men. They murdered Hank, they stole my life's work.

Saul: I don't know any hitmen.

Walt: You know a guy who knows a guy. Just get me the contacts, anybody in that world. I'm paying top dollar, we'll find them.

Saul: You mind if I give you a nickel's worth of advice just for old time's sake? You're worried about your wife and kids. Don't leave. The way things are right now, some people, not me, mind you, but some people might say you're leaving her high and dry.

Walt: Some people would be ignorant on the facts. Some people wouldn't know that as far as the police are concerned, Skyler is a blameless victim.

*Saul sits back down, waving Walt off*

Walt: No, no, no, go ahead. Get it off your chest. Go on.

Saul: The phone call was a smart move, kudos to you. Odds are, it was recorded, it's gonna play great for a jury, it might even buy her a mistrial. In a year and a half. Until then, if they don't have you, they're going after her.

Walt: There's no point. She knows nothing.

Saul: Well, too bad for her then. She's got nothing to trade. I hate to be a downer here, but there are two DEA agents missing, presumed dead. You think the feds are gonna just let that go because you hit the ejector seat? First thing they're gonna do is they'll RICO your wife and kids out of the house. That condo is gone. Your bank account is frozen. Her picture's probably on TV right now next to yours. Who's gonna hire her?

Walt: Money's no problem.

Saul: Well, I don't mean to contradict you, but getting it to her? Impossible. The feds are just praying that she'll make contact. The Internet, the phones, it's all tapped. Hey, Mike was no dummy. But every time he tried to get his nest egg to his granddaughter, it ended up in Uncle Sam's pockets.

Walt: So you propose what?

Saul: Stay. Face the music. Hey, I mean how much time do you got left? You walk in with your head held high, you'll be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan Detention Center. How bad is that? And you bring a barrel full of drug money? Maybe that soothes some troubled waters. Maybe they let your family stay in the house. After all, the house predates the criminal enterprise.

Walt: You think I wanna run?! This is the last thing that I want! This, this changes nothing. What I do, I do for my family. My money goes to my children. Not just this barrel, all of it! I'm going to kill Jack and his entire crew. And I'm going to take back what is mine and give it to my children and then AND ONLY THEN am I through. Do you understand?

*The extractor opens the door and walks in*

The extractor: Everything good?

Saul: Define good.

The extractor: *to Saul* You're set, time to go. *to Walt* You'll be a little longer, still workin' on transportation.

Walt: Change of plans. He's coming with me.

Saul: No. No, that's not.

Walt: We're going together. I can use him.

The extractor: I'll give you two a minute.

Saul: Hey, I'm a civilian. I'm not your lawyer anymore, I'm nobody's lawyer, the fun's over. From here on out, I'm mister low profile. Just another douchebag with a job and three pairs of Dockers. If I'm lucky, three months from now, best case scenario, I'm managing a Cinnabon in Omaha.

Walt: You're still part of this whether you like it or not.

Saul: I'm sorry, I don't think so.

*Walt stares at Saul and starts walking him back into the wall*

Walt: You remember what I told you? It's not over...unti-

*Walt begins coughing and falls onto the bed. Saul looks down at him*

Saul: It's over.

*Saul walks away as Walt continues to cough. Saul grabs his suitcases and leaves*

*There is a loud, screeching noise playing as Skyler sits at a desk with attorneys and stares forward. They're talking about Skyler's situation but she's seemingly not listening*

Attorney: Is she even listening? *to Skyler* Mrs. White. Are you following all this? Do you understand what's happening here?

Skyler: Yes. I understand. I understand I'm in terrible trouble. I understand that you will use everything in your power against me and my children unless, unless I give you Walt. But the truth is, I can't give you what you want. I don't know where he is.

Attorney: Alright, go and discuss this with your lawyer here. Rack your brain and hope you can come up with something we can use.

*Two officers are sitting in a car outside the White residence*

Woman on radio: 417.

Officer: 417, no activity.

*Skyler sits on the couch staring out the window while she smokes a cigarette and holds a drink in her hand. Holly cries out in the distance. Skyler walks towards the bedroom. Inside are three masked Neo-Nazis. One runs to cover her mouth*

Todd: *to Skyler* Ma'am, is there anybody else in the house? What about your son. If I go look in his room, am I gonna see him? He's not gonna pop out and surprise me? If this guy takes his hand away, are you gonna scream?

Skyler: *breathing heavily* He's at his friend's house. He's been there all week. Please. Please, don't hurt my baby. Please.

Todd: Ma'am.

Skyler: Please.

Todd: We got a lot of respect for your husband. It's just something we gotta straighten out. Look, we know you've been talking to the police and that's okay, you gotta do that. But you've seen some people. Like the lady who came into the car wash? The one with the black hair. Have you said anything about her? You sure about that?

Skyler: I didn't.

Todd: The police don't need to know anything about her.

*Skyler shakes her head*

Todd: Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to say it.

Skyler: I will not say anything about her, ever. I swear.

Todd: Okay. When we leave, you're not gonna go running to those police officers out front?

Skyler: No.

Todd: Okay. Okay. I just really don't want us coming back here.

*Todd looks at her one last time with his hand on her shoulder. He nods, then leaves with the other two Neo-Nazis. Skyler runs to Holly's crib where she's now crying*

*Todd takes a sip from his cup. Lydia walks into the restaurant and past him and sits behind him. Todd goes to get up*

Lydia: Don't. Stay where you are. We'll talk like this.

Todd: Okay. So that thing that we talked about, I went to Mr. and Mrs. White's house-

Lyda: You don't have to say the name.

Todd: Sure, and it went really good. The message was received loud and clear.

Lydia: The message? Yeah. Look. I know you did your best, I just think-

Waitress: Hi. What can I get you?

Lydia: Chamomile tea with soy milk, please. And I'll need more Stevia.

Waitress: Sure.

Lydia: *to Todd* The person we're discussing saw my face. You're not Western Union, Todd, we can't just settle with you sending messages.

Todd: Really, if you'd been there, I think you'd see it different. We threw a real scare into her. She seems like a nice lady watching out for her kids. So, you're not going to have a problem with her, I can pretty much guarantee it.

Lydia: I wish I had your certainty, but I'm not like you and your uncle. I'm just, I'm not used to this sort of risk. We're gonna have to take a break.

*Lydia grabs her purse and begins searching through it*

Todd: I have fifty pounds vacuum-packed and ready to go.

Lydia: And I wish you all the luck in the world with it.

Todd: It's 92%.

Lydia: I'm sorry?

Todd: 92%.

Lydia: Truly?

Todd: Tested it twice and it's blue just like before.

Lydia: 92? That's Heisenberg level. He's not with you?

Todd: Next best thing, Pinkman.

Lydia: They're looking for Pinkman.

Todd: Well, they're not gonna find him, he's with us and he's not going anywhere. Ms. Quayle, this is what your guys in Europe have been begging for, right? I just think we work together...good. We make a good team. I think it's kind of mutually good.

Lydia: 92%.

*Todd reaches forward and picks something off Lydia's back*

*Walt stumbles out of the propane truck*

The extractor: Mr. Lambert. Welcome to New Hampshire.

*Walt wheels his barrel of money into his new lodge*

Walt: Alright, let's have a look at this place.

The extractor: You got about a month's worth of food on hand. Most of it's canned goods, but there's steaks in the freezer. You got a generator outside, works on LP. Oughta be enough in the tank to last out the winter. It's only fifteen amps, but that oughta do for the lights, TV, and the freezer. That's a woodburner, oughta warm the place up pretty good, plus you can cook on it. On the TV front, the reception is pretty much nil. You've got some mountains in the way. Weather's right you might be able to catch Montreal, but mostly you'll be limited to DVDs.

Walt: *looking through the DVDs* Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. Two copies.

The extractor: I'm not much of a movie guy. I'll make a supply run next month, you want something else to watch, put it on the list.

Walt: Supply run. $50,000 for a trip to Costco.

The extractor: It's risk. And risk is what you're paying me for, not toilet paper. Risk and a 4400-mile round-trip. Mr. Lambert, my clients and I don't usually have an ongoing relationship. Normally, you and I would've gone our separate ways, but you're you.

Walt: Where's the phone?

The extractor: No phone. Up here, ice storms equal service calls equal you in cuffs.

Walt: Internet?

The extractor: Same deal. Also, satellite, cable TV, drop phone, car. You want news, I'll bring the Albuquerque papers. Whatever you need, just

*Walt and the extractor at the same time* Put it on the list.

Walt: Yeah. Look, I have business to conduct.

The extractor: Your business is your business. My business is keeping you out of custody. You are the target of a nationwide manhunt. Your face is all over TV. You are the hottest client I've ever had by far. That stands to reason, you've gotta keep out of sight.

Walt: And what's keeping me from walking out that gate?

The extractor: Nothing. There's a little one-horse town eight miles down the hill. There's not a thing on God's green earth that I could do to stop you from going down there. All I'm saying is, if you leave this place, you will get caught. And I gotta tell you. If I found out you've left the reservation, I won't be coming back. That is for my own safety, you understand?

Walt: Sure.

The extractor: You know how to work the stove? The flue can be tricky.

Walt: Yeah, I've got it.

The extractor: You paid good money for this. You've got two acres up here, lots of wood, nice, warm place. Seems to me just the spot for a man to rest up. Think on things. If you look around, it's kind of beautiful.

Walt: You're very helpful. Thank you.

*Walt walks away as the extractor gets into his propane truck*

The extractor: See you in a month.

*Walt opens up his barrel of money. He grabs a few handfuls and stuffs them into his coat pockets. He puts the top back on and looks at a black duffel bag. He reaches inside and pulls out his Heisenberg hat. Music begins playing as he puts it on and heads outside. He walks along the path to the front gate and opens it. He stares down the road for a bit then starts coughing. He closes the gate*

Walt: Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

*He walks back to the house. Inside the house, he lights a match, starts the wood burning stove, and warms up*

*Jesse is standing on a bucket, which is on top of his other things in an attempt to reach the bars up top and escape*

Neo-Nazi: Oh, so you're just too good to eat with the rest of us, huh?

Todd: It's not for me.

*Jesse jumps down off the bucket*

Neo-Nazi: Damn, man, seriously? It's not my chocolate-chip, is it? You're gonna spoil him!

*Todd removes the tarp*

Todd: *to Jesse* Hey, you awake?

Jesse: Huh? Yeah.

Todd: We had some Ben and Jerry's. There was peanut butter and AmeriCone Dream. I didn't know what you like, so I got you some of each.

*Todd lowers a bucket with ice cream down to Jesse*

Todd: There you go.

*Jesse takes the ice cream and Todd reels the bucket back in. Todd takes out a cigarette and lights it*

Todd: So, that batch that you just cooked. It was 96%. Kind of figured you deserved a little something.

Jesse: Thanks.

Todd: Well. Better get some sleep, tomorrow's gonna be a big day. Got a whole new batch.

Jesse: Hey, uh, Todd.

Todd: Yeah.

Jesse: You mind leaving the tarp off tonight?

Todd: It might get cold.

Jesse: No, I, I don't mind, I just wanna see the stars.

Todd: Sure. Okay.

Jesse: Thanks.

Todd: Goodnight, Jesse.

Jesse: Goodnight.

*Todd walks away and Jesse uses the paperclip to break out of his handcuffs again. He gets on top of the bucket and jumps up to the bars and manages to unlock the gate and climb out. He runs away and tries to escape. He runs past a camera and toward the gate with barbed wire. As he's climbing it, the Neo-Nazis surround him*

Jesse: Do it! Do it! Just kill me now and get it over with because there's no way I'm doing one more cook for you psycho fucks!

*Todd walks towards Andrea's house. He rings her doorbell and Andrea answers*

Andrea: Yes?

Todd: Hi, ma'am, how you doing tonight? You're Andrea, right?

Andrea: How can I help you?

Todd: You know Jesse Pinkman, right? I'm a friend of his, my name's Todd. Sorry to bother you so late, it's nice to meet you.

Andrea: How is Jesse, is he okay?

Todd: Yeah, he's okay. Actually, I brought him with me.

Andrea: Jesse's here?

Todd: Yeah, he's right over there in that truck.

*Andrea walks out onto the porch. Jesse is in the truck slamming against the door. Todd checks to make sure the coast is clear and takes out his gun*

Todd: Just so you know, this isn't personal.

*Todd shoots Andrea in the back of the head. Jesse screams in agony in the truck. Todd opens the door and gets back in the truck*

Jack: Woah. Hey! Settle down. Settle down. Hey, remember. There's still a kid.

*Walt walks towards the gate as the extractor approaches. Walt opens the gate*

*Inside, Walt cuts open the stack of newspapers and gets one to read*

The extractor: I brought you a couple cases of Ensure maybe to put a little weight on you.

Walt: Jesus, I can barely read this.

The extractor: Almost forgot. Without a prescription, I had to take an educated guess and shotgun it, one of these oughta come close.

Walt: Oh. Did you check on them? Is Skyler in a better place?

The extractor: Nah, she's still at that place off Eubank. Kids are both still with her for the moment. There's no court date yet. News was talking about a grand jury, but didn't say when. I saw her public defender on TV, looks like a deer in the headlights. I think I got socks older than him.

Walt: What are they doing for money?

The extractor: She's doing taxi dispatch part-time. Leaves the baby with the neighbor when she goes in. I saw her shopping one time, she looks pretty good. And she's using her maiden name, I wouldn't take it personally under the circumstances. Those working for ya?

Walt: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

The extractor: I took a run by your old house, the auction is still pending. They put a fence up around it.

Walt: They put up a fence?

The extractor: Seems like the place got to be kind of a tourist attraction. Kids breaking in. Neighbors complained, so the bank put up a fence. *holding a box* You ready?

Walt: Hm? Yeah.

The extractor: Sorry about last time, should go better now. I watched a couple of YouTube videos, it's all about finding the vein.

Walt: Give it to me, I'll do it.

*Walt tries to insert the IV into his arm*

Walt: Here, you do it.

The extractor: Make a fist, tight, there we go. Alright, let's just stick, that's it. Okay, hey, pretty good, there we go. I think I had it worse at my last physical. *gets up to leave* I will see you on, let's see. Afternoon of the fifteenth.

Walt: Stay a little longer?

The extractor: Yeah, I got a long trip ahead of me.

Walt: Two hours? I'll give you another $10,000. Please.

The extractor: 10,000? One hour.

*Walt agrees*

The extractor: Cards? Alright, well, the game will be seven-card. I'll deal since you are...encumbered.

Walt: One of these days when you come up here, I'll be dead. My money over there, what happens to it then? What if I asked you to give it to my family? Would you do it?

The extractor: If I said yes, would you believe me? You wanna cut the cards?

Walt: No.

The extractor: A king. Two kings.

*Walt is lying in his bed. He starts coughing and his wedding ring slides off his finger. He gets up and picks it up. He takes some twine and ties his ring around his neck, coughing. He looks over at the Ensure boxes and gets up. He opens one up, empties it out, and puts some money in. He takes the box full of money and walks to the gate. He unlocks the gate and hesitates to leave. He walks toward town with the box*

Carmen: *over the PA* Flynn White to the principal's office, please.

*Junior gets up*

Carmen: *to Junior* I'm sorry to pull you out of class. It's your aunt Marie, it sounds very important. You can take it in here, okay? *into phone* Here he is.

Junior: *to Carmen* Thank you. *into phone* Hey, Aunt Marie, what's going on?

Woman at bar: Hold on a sec, honey.

*She hands the phone off to Walt, who gives her some money. A hockey game is playing in the background*

Walt: Son, it's me. Please, don't let on. Carmen's nearby, right? She cannot know. Son, are you there?

Junior: Yes.

Walt: It's so good to hear your voice. I, I, uh. Son, the things that they're saying about me. I did wrong, I made some terrible mistakes. But the reasons were always. Things happened that I never intended...I never intended. Listen, son, we don't have much time. Is Louis's family still at 4848 Newcomb? Son, your friend, Louis Corbett. Does his family still live in that same place up on Newcomb?

Junior: Yeah, yeah.

Walt: Okay, good. He's, he's a good kid, he's like you, he'll understand. I'm sending Louis a package. Now, it's addressed to Louis, but it's for you, your mother, and your sister. There's money inside. About $100,000, okay? I think. It's all that I could fit in the box. It has to be a secret. If anyone says a word, the police will take it. I wanted to give you so much more, but this is all I could do, do you understand? Son? Can you hear me? Do you understand?

Junior: You want to send money.

Walt: Yes. Good. Good, good. So you'll talk to Louis, right?

Junior: You killed Uncle Hank! You killed him!

Walt: Wait, no. Wait, son, please.

Junior: What you did to Mom, you asshole.

Walt: Listen to me, you've got to listen to me.

Junior: Just shut up. Just stop it, stop it. I don't want anything from you. I don't give a shit.

Walt: You need this money, your mother. Your mother needs this money.

Junior: You killed Uncle Hank. You killed him.

Walt: It can't all be for nothing! Please. Please.

Junior: No, no, what you did. Shut up. Shut up. Will you just, just leave us alone. You asshole! Why are you still alive? Why don't you just, just die already, just die.

*Junior hangs up the phone. Walt calls the DEA*

Agent on phone: DEA, Albuquerque district office, how may I direct your call?

Walt: I'd like to speak to the agent in charge of the Walter White investigation.

Agent on phone: Who may I say is calling?

Walt: Walter White.

*Walt drops the phone and walks over to the bar*

Agent on phone: Hello? Hello? Sir? Sir, are you still there?

Bartender: You ready for that drink now?

Walt: Dimple Pinch. Neat.

Bartender: You got it.

*Bartender pours him a glass of whiskey. Walt takes a sip while the bartender changes the channel*

Walt: Would you, would you, would you go back? Please.

*Bartender changes channel*

Walt: There.

Bartender: What, this?

Walt: Yeah.

Gretchen Schwartz: *on TV* Exactly. We're thrilled with the way things turned out.

Charlie Rose: *on TV* But just yesterday, your charity, the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz foundation, announced a twenty-eight million dollar grant for drug abuse treatment centers throughout the southwest.

Elliott Schwartz: *on TV* Charlie, the southwest is our home and we couldn't just ignore what's going on in our own backyard.

Charlie Rose: But I'm sure you're aware there are people who suggest other motives. Andrew R. Sorkin of The New York Times wrote a column suggesting that the grant was a kind of publicity maneuver to shore up the stock price of Gray Matter Technologies because of your association with Walter White.

Elliott Schwartz: Well, that's not exactly what I-

Charlie Rose: To cleanse yourself, so to speak, of having a methamphetamine kingpin as co-founder of your company.

Elliott Schwartz: Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up. I have to believe that the investing public understands that we're talking about a person who was there early on, but who had virtually nothing to do with the creation of the company and still less to do with growing it into what it is today.

Charlie Rose: So, what was Walter White's contribution?

Elliott Schwartz: You know, to be honest. Honey?

Gretchen Schwartz: The company name.

Elliott Schwartz: The company name. We came up with it by combining our names, Schwartz means black. Black plus white makes gray.

Charlie Rose: Hence Gray Matter Technologies.

Elliott Schwartz: Exactly. As far as I can recall, his contribution begins and ends right there.

Charlie Rose: There are continued reports of blue methamphetamine, considered his signature product, throughout the southwest, and some evidence of reaching as far as Europe. So, my question is, is Walter White still out there?

Gretchen Schwartz: No, he's not.

Charlie Rose: You sound very sure.

Gretchen Schwartz: I am. I can't speak to this Heisenberg that people refer to, but whatever he became, the sweet, kind, brilliant man that we once knew long ago. He's gone.

Charlie Rose: But to be absolutely clear-

*Breaking Bad theme begins playing loudly as Walt stares forward. Police arrive at the bar and head inside. The bartender is standing in the corner, Walt's glass of whiskey is sitting on the table alone*

Just get me home.

Just get me home.

I'll do the rest.

Yes, hello, this is David Linn

from The New York Times.

May I speak with Susan, please?



Thank you.

Hi, Susan, it's David again.

I was just calling
to see if we can set...

Well, yes, well, I figured

we have to do
the interview by phone

since they've already
left New York.

But what we'd
really love to get

is a photo of
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz

to go along with the article.

When... when are they
scheduled to get home?

Oh, so they'll be home tonight.

Gotcha.

Now, the address I have on them

is Upper Canyon Road.



Is that still...

No, it isn't.
They've... Oh.

Let me get a pen.

Where do they...

Tesuque, I see.

And the address?

Is that... is that
up near the opera house?

I hear that's nice.

Well, I'll be in contact
with my photographer

to check on his schedule.

No, no, it's...
it's their call.

I know how busy
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz are.

Thank you.

This should make
one hell of a story.

Goodbye.

I'm just saying

it's apples and oranges.

Listen, I maintain,

if... if...
if I want pizza,

- I go to a pizza place.
- Yeah.

If I want Thai, I go...
I go to a Thai place.

I mean, what is the...
what is the earthly point...

Did I marry you?

...in comparing pizza
to Thai food?

What has happened
to your intelligence?

- This is different.
- They're completely...

Oh, come on,
are you the man I married?

I am the guy who
wants to end this

ridiculous conversation,

kick off my shoes,

and have a very large
glass of wine.

Well, I'm gonna tell you

to be my guest.

All right, wait.

The answer is...

21.

- No.
- Yes.

Yes, because it has history.

Come on.

Prohibition.

The sweet smell of success.

And per se
has Thomas Keller.

Game, set, and match.

The whole
vibe is so Yountville.

You transplant it to Manhattan,

- it starts to feel...
- You could transplant it

to Islamabad,
I would still eat there.

Ooh, there's a good thought.

- What, Islamabad?
- No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.

Oh, my God,
all this talk of food.

Do you think Juana
left us anything?

No, I don't think so,

she thought that we were
coming back on Wednesday.

Unless you told her otherwise.

No, I haven't talked to her.

Oh, look, here.

Just a pear,
that'll be perfect.

- Yeah.
- You wanna get us a nice bottle of wine?

Mm-hmm.

We have any of those...

crackers with the,

like, the sun-dried
tomato and then

they were kind of
slightly peppery,

but not too peppery.

We don't have them?

I don't know.
Ask Juana.

We haven't had them in forever.

I don't know why she
doesn't get those anymore.

Why don't you talk to her?

I don't know, she's got that thing
going on with her daughter.

Anyway, Napa?

Yeah?

How long is it since
we've been there?

Two years, Thanksgiving.
Jesus, that's two years.

- Yeah. Too long, right?
- Is this okay?

Oh, that looks perfecto.

You wanna get the fireplace?

- Is it good?
- Mm-hmm.

- Is it ripe?
- Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

You know, we could
invite George and Delores,

they could come up from Marin.

And Bill and Miriam Cohen.

We could have a little
spa action, right?

And then we could do some
sort of wine, and then...

Aah!

Hello, Gretchen.

Elliott.

I really like your new house.

Walt.

This...

Are we looking east?

Oh.

My God, you must
have one great view

of the Sangre De Cristos.

Walt,

what... what are
you doing here?

I saw you on Charlie Rose.

You looked great.

You both did.

If you are here to...

to hurt us...

Walt, whatever

it is you're planning...

Actually, I'm here
to give you something.

It's out in my car.

How about the three of us
take a walk to it?

It's just parked down the road.

I couldn't get it
past your gate.

Elliott,

if we're gonna go that way,

you'll need a bigger knife.

Keep stacking.

It'll all fit.

That's all right.

Yeah, just... just
throw it on top.

Gretchen, would you mind?

We don't want to lose
any under the furniture.

All right.

That is $9,720,000.

Where did it come from?

And why is it here?

I earned it,

and you're going to
give it to my children.

What? Why?

- Walt, I don't think we...
- On my son's 18th birthday,

which is ten months and
two days from today,

you will give him this money

in the form of an
irrevocable trust.

You will tell him
that it is his

to do with as he sees fit,

but with the hope

that he uses it for
his college education.

And for the betterment
of his family.

Walt, I'm not sure
that we follow.

Why, uh, I mean,

why, in particular,
would we...

If you wanna give
your kids drug money,

go do it yourself.

I can't.

My wife and son hate me.

They won't take my money.

Even if they did,

the federal government
wouldn't let them.

But two rich benefactors,

who are known for their
charitable endeavors,

who would think nothing
of, for instance,

writing a $28 million check

to help victims of
methamphetamine abuse?

I have to think that your money

would be very welcome.

It wouldn't make any sense
coming from us.

It certainly would.

My children are
blameless victims

of their monstrous father.

A man who you
once knew quite well.

Call it a beau geste,

call it liberal guilt,

call it whatever you want,

but do it.

And you are not to spend

a single dime
of your own money.

If there are taxes

or lawyers' fees owed,

you will take it
right from here.

They use my money, never yours.

Okay, Walt, sure.

That...
that sounds reasonable.

So what happens next?

I guess we shake on it,

and I leave.

I can trust you to do this.

Yes.

Absolutely you can.

Oh!

Don't move.
Don't...

Don't dare move a muscle.

You don't want them to think

that you're trying to get away.

Just breathe.

Just this afternoon,

I had an extra $200,000

that I would have loved dearly

to leave on top of this table.

Instead,

I gave it to the two best

hitmen west of the Mississippi.

Now,

whatever happens
to me tomorrow,

they'll still be out there.

Keeping tabs.

And if,

for any reason,

that my children
do not get this money,

a kind of...

countdown will begin.

Maybe a day or so later,

maybe a week, a year,

when you're going for
a walk in Santa Fe

or Manhattan
or Prague, wherever,

and you're...

talking about
your stock prices...

without a worry in the world.

And then suddenly,

you'll hear the scrape

of a footstep behind you,

but before you can
even turn around,

- pop!
- Aah!

Darkness.

Cheer up, beautiful people.

This is where you get
to make it right.

Oh, yeah, right.

You know, I don't exactly

know how to feel
about all this.

For real, yo.

Whole thing felt kinda shady,
you know, like,

morality-wise?

Totally.

How do you feel now?

Better.

Yeah, definitely improving.

What's this I hear about

blue meth still
being out there?

What do you mean?

Have you heard anything?

Is it still being sold?

Yeah.

By whom?

It's you, right?

I mean, aren't you
still cooking?

Damn, man.

We were sure it was you,

because that shit
is choice, yo.

Better than ever.

I mean, um, you know.

Jesse.

Seriously?

You said he moved to Alaska.

That's what I heard.

Right on, Jesse.

Passing the torch.

Damn, man, couldn't he at least
throw a brother a bone?

Wow, what happened there?

It's my birthday.

Yeah? Well,
happy birthday.

It's easy money.

Until we catch you.

Walt, just say the word

and I'll take you
on a ride-along.

You can watch us knock down
a meth lab, huh?

Get a little excitement
in your life.

Someday.

Welcome to The Grove.

Would you like to see a menu?

No, thank you.

Chamomile tea
with soy milk, please.

All right, you got it.

Hey, how you doing?

Good.

How's things?

Hey, I like your...

shirt.

My blouse?

Nice, yeah, the color.

That's a nice color on you.

It's kind of a...

I don't know exactly
what you'd call it.

It's kind of a cornflower.

Before you say or do anything,

just hear me out.

Todd...

Nobody knows that I'm here.

Just listen for two minutes

and then I'll leave.

Please.

Please.

Just two minutes of your time.

That's all I ask.

Please.

You're running out
of methylamine, aren't you?

I can do the math.

You've been at it long enough.

You must be running low.

I have a new method

that requires no methylamine.

And it's easy, and it will

keep you in business.

And Todd, I could
teach it to you.

How did you know
to find us here?

10:00 AM
every Tuesday morning,

you and I met here.

You're rather...

schedule-oriented,
I guess.

Sorry.

I need the money.

I've spent almost all of mine.

Already, just trying to stay

one step ahead of the police.

Mr. White, I don't
think there's...

How much would it cost us?

Nothing short of a million,

and believe me, for this,

that is...
is giving it away.

I think Jack should hear this.

Yeah, I don't know.

Now listen, I can...

I can come up there tonight

and talk to him.

He'd get it.

This is a win-win
situation.

Hi, what can I get for you two?

He's just leaving.

Good seeing you again.
Take care.

For you?

I'm good.

And I need more stevia.

Okay, no disrespect to the man,

but doing business with him?

Right now,
that's not...

Of course, we're not
doing business with him.

Todd, please.

Don't make me
walk you through this.

Jesus.
Did you look at him?

You'd be doing him a favor.

Hello,
please record after the tone.

Truce, all right?

Skyler, I have news about Walt,

and you need to hear it immediately,
so if you're there, pick up.

Skyler...

Hey.

What's up?

Walt's in town.

Yeah?

That car they thought he stole

in New Hampshire,

they found it in
a Denny's parking lot

right on Central.

And your old
next-door neighbor,

the one on the right,
what's her name, Becky?

Becky's on the left.
Carol's on the right.

Becky, Carol, whatever.

She saw him at your old house.

Just this morning,
plain as day.

He's there, walking
out of your house,

and he calls her by name.

He didn't hurt her, did he?
He didn't...

No, he's just like,
"Hey, Becky!"

Or Carol, whatever.

She said he looked
exactly like the Unabomber,

but she's positive it was him.

Skyler, we're getting
calls from all over town.

He's here, he's there,

he's going
to blow up city hall.

Apparently he has
some sort of manifesto.

He wants to be on
the six o'clock news.

- It's just...
- Who's making these calls, him?

There are two or three
different voices.

They're not sure
if they're crank calls

or people he's put up to it

or if they're actual
anonymous tips.

And it's stretching them thin,

which is maybe the point.

As far as I'm concerned,
and I've told them this,

there are three places
that he would go.

To you, to me, or Flynn.

Right.

They're watching
the high school.

They're probably
watching your place, too.

I mean,

I know that's what
Hank would do.

There's no way
Walt's getting to you.

They are absolutely
going to catch him.

No doubt about it.

That arrogant asshole thinks

he's some criminal mastermind,

but he's not.

But on the off-chance...

Yeah.

On the million-to-one
chance...

you be on the lookout, okay?

Thanks.

You got it.

Five minutes.

Five minutes.

You didn't kill anybody

sneaking in here, did you?

You didn't hurt anybody?

No.

Didn't have to.

You look terrible.

Yeah.

But I feel good.

So talk.

Why are you here?

It's over.

And I needed a proper goodbye.

Not our last phone call.

So you're going to the police?

They'll be coming to me.

If you're in custody,

what stops those people
from coming back,

those people you worked with?

When... when I still
had the house,

three men came

in the middle of the night,

wearing masks, threatening
Holly and Flynn and me.

They told me not to talk about

that woman I saw
at the car wash,

and if you're in custody
and they find out…

They're not coming back.

Not after tonight.

What's tonight?

We don't want your money, Walt.

I thought Flynn
made that clear.

He did.

And I don't have any
to give you.

I spent the last
of it getting here.

All I have to give you

is this.

Call the DEA once I leave.

Tell them I was here.

That I forced my way in.

Tell them...

Tell them I wanted
bacon and eggs

on my birthday,

and that I gave you
that ticket.

Those numbers
are GPS coordinates.

For what?

A burial site.

That's where they'll
find Hank and Steve Gomez.

That's where
I buried our money.

The men who stole it from us,

the men who still have it,

they murdered Hank and Steve

and put them in that hole.

Now you trade that

for a deal with the prosecutor.

You get yourself out of this.

Skyler.

Skyler.

All the things that I did,

- you need to understand...
- If I have to hear

one more time

that you did this

for the family...

I did it for me.

I liked it.

I was good at it.

And...

I was...

really...

I was alive.

Flynn will be home soon.

Before I go...

may I see her?

Whoo.

Damn man,
this thing's a classic.

What block you got in it?

500 or the 425?

Couldn't tell you.

500.

That's the one you want.

No replacement
for displacement.

Where to?

To the clubhouse.

Go ahead, just park it

right in front over here.

No, no, no,
just straight in, man,

just, what are...

All right, fine,
here, whatever.

Hey, how you doing?

Turn around, put your
arms out like this.

While you're at it,

should lift your shirt up.

Give us a spin.

Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.

Okay?

My wallet and keys?

Yeah, you'll get them back.

Just relax.

Stay here.

Keep your eyes open.

Jesus, look at you
with that head of hair.

Is that real?

Yes.

That's not a wig?

Seriously?

No.

What were you doing before,
shaving it?

Yes.

Christ, that is one
fine head of hair.

I mean, otherwise you
look like shit, but...

Hello to you too, Jack.

Can we talk business?

I don't think so, no.

Did Todd tell you
what I'm offering?

Yeah, he told me.

Thing is, we're...

not really in the market.

You're running low
on methylamine,

what happens then?

No, we'll get more.

That Quayle woman's
got her own set-up.

The heat's off her.

She can break loose a barrel
every now and again.

It ain't broke, so why fix it?

Todd, please, would you
explain things to your uncle?

Explain to him the benefit
of what I'm offering.

You really shouldn't
have come back, Mr. White.

I'm sorry.

Wait. Jack.

Where do you want it?

Well, gee, I don't know,

anywhere but my living room?

Take him out back.

- Jack, look, you owe me.
- Hey, come on.

- You owe me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

I owe you, what for?

Jesse Pinkman,
you promised that

you would kill him,
and you didn't.

Instead, you
partnered with him.

You're his
partner now...

Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

Partners,
what are you talking about?

He's alive, isn't he?

He's cooking for you.

What, are you gonna lie?

Him being alive is not

him and me being partners.

Not by a damn sight.

What, you think
I'd partner with a rat?

Where's that little
piece of shit?

He's finishing up a batch.

Well, go get him.
Bring him here.

- Uncle Jack...
- No. No, no, no.

This one here
calling me a liar?

He just insulted you,
he insulted me, all of us.

Jesus. Hustle it up.
Come on.

Let's get this over with.

I'm gonna show you
just how wrong you are,

then I'm putting that bullet
in your head myself.

You see what I'm talking about,
you son of a bitch?

Now, this look like
a partner to you?

Come here.
Take a look.

Come here!

Take a look at him.

Have a gander.

This is my partner.

Right, partner?
Right, buddy?

Hardworking, good partner.
50-50 partner.

Can you hurry this shit up?
Make it quick?

Toddy, get him off, would ya?

Yeah, Toddy, get them both off.

Aah!

Uncle Jack...

Jesus.

Mr. White...

Aah!

Wait.

Wait.

You want your money, right?

Huh?

You wanna know where it is?

You pull that trigger,
you'll never...

Do it.

You want this.

Say the words.

Say you want this!

Nothing happens
until I hear you say it.

I want this.

Then do it yourself.

Pick up the phone.

Hello?

Is it done?

Is he gone?

Yeah, it's done.

He's gone.

They're all gone.

Todd?
Who is this?

It's Walt.

How are you feeling?

Kind of under the weather?

Like you've got the flu?

That would be the ricin
I gave you.

I slipped it into
that stevia crap

that you're always putting
in your tea.

Oh, my God.

Well...

goodbye, Lydia.

Aahh!
