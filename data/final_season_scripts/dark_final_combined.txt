      Have you ever wondered if it's possible to rewind time?

[chuckles] 
 
102 
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,125 Yes. Yes I have. 
 
103 
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,458 And? 
 
104 
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,333 Possible, you think? 
 
                105 00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,625 
To go back and try changing anything? 
 
106 
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,250 You're such an adult now. 
 
107 
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,083 Adult enough. 
 
108 
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,458 
For quite a while now, I've wanted to be able to turn back time. 
 
                109 00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500 
But my place is not in the past. 
 
110 
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,583 Nor in the future. 
 
111 
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,125 
It's here,

113 
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,875 Are those my parents? 
 
114 
       00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,333 I thought you said there were no photos. 
 
115 
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,416 That photo's not you. 
 
116 
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,750 Those aren't your parents. 
 
117 
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,291 That's my son and his wife. 
 
118 
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,750 And my granddaughter. 
 
119 
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,958 They died in a car accident. 
 
120 
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,583 
That night, when it happened, 
 
121 
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,166 I woke up. 
 
                122 00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,166 
There was a noise down in the store. 
 
123 
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,166 There were two women. 
 
124 
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,541 Strange looking. 
 
125 
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,041 They were carrying a bundle. 
 
126 
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,333 That bundle was you. 
 
127 
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,333 
They said 
 
128 
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:21,541 that on that night 
everything would be taken from me. 
 
129

And then I'd be given everything. 
 
130 
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,333 Then I got the call. 
 
131 
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,625 
On the bridge, 
 
132 
   00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:37,791 a truck... had forced my son's car into the river. 
 
133 
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,875 
They only ever found the bodies of my son and his wife in there.

215 
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,916 
He wants to destroy both worlds forever and untie the knot. 
 
216 
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,708 
                He doesn't know that death is what he'll want in the end. 
 
217 
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,125 
But all his impulses on this journey will lead to that end.

Jonas said we could change it. 
 
221 
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,125 
  We change one component, we change the entire world. 
 
222 
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,333 It was you who told him that.

                226 00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,000 
Jonas opened the passage in 2020. 
 
227 
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,791 
          The older Jonas had previously shut it in 2019. 
 
228 
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,750 
           After it'd been opened in the summer of 1986 for the first time. 
 
229 
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:35,166 
In all three moments, they left behind traces of cesium residue, 
 
230 
  00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,333 a component of the black matter. 
 
231 
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,041 Half-lives. 
 
232 
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,458 
In every cycle, 
at each of these three moments, 
 
233 
       00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:52,041 this cesium is carried through the tunnel 
and back before it's completely decayed. 
 
                234 00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,583 
It exponentially expands endlessly. 
 
235 
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,250 So the passage is the result. 
 
                236 00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,041 
It must continue to exist forever.

Everything has to happen again.

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,500 
Jonas has to bring the matter to the passage.

 And opening one of the nuclear plant barrels has to trigger the apocalypse.

Mm-hmm. 
 
232

                233 00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,791 
It has a huge gravitational pull. 
 
234 
    00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:40,875 Everything around the hole is pulled towards it and dragged inside of it. 
 
                235 00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,291 
Other stars, planets, even light. 
 
236 
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,083 
The gravitational force is so strong 
 
237 
   00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,958 that even light is pulled into it. 
 
                238 00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,416 
Nothing can escape once it's inside.

Basically, no one knows what's behind it.

243 
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,375 
     Erik was last seen walking on the forest road. 244 
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:20,750 
We could compare employees' tire tracks with the tracks we found. 
 
                245 00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,750 
And do you have a court order? 
 
246 
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,083 I don't have a warrant. 
 
247 
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:29,958 It's a request. 
 
                248 00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,791 
I'll have the schedules sent to you. 
 
249 
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,583 So how are you? 
 
250 
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:54,625 All right. 
 
251 
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,541 Okay then. 
 
252 
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,250 I've been wondering... 
 
253 
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,166 
              Do you think Erik could have made his way onto the grounds?

[old Claudia] But yours has no end. 
 
8 
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,583 It goes on forever and ever. 
 
9 
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:30,083 
  I'm here to finally make your journey come to an end. 
 
10 
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,333 This is impossible. 
 
11 
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,416 You should be dead. 
 
12 
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,375 I had you killed. 
 
13 
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,333 
You still have no idea 

just how this game is played. 
 
14 
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,125 
You want to destroy the knot, 
 
15 
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,666 but every action you take 
continues its existence. 
 
16 
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,583 This can't be. 
 
17 
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,791 I have killed it. 
 
18 
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:14,375 I have killed the origin, and the origin within her. 
 
19 
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,208 
Your world and Eve's world, 
 
20 
    00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,041 they both should have never existed. 
 
21 
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:34,708 
     You thought that the origin lies in the bindings of both worlds. 
 
22 
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,916 
        But in reality, it's outside of both worlds. 
 
                23 00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,083 
Our thinking is shaped by dualities.

27 
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000 But this is false. 
 
28 
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,000 
You need a third dimension to fulfill it all.

34 
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,375 Where everything originates.

Tannhaus, in the origin world, 
 
38 
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,958 like you, he lost someone. 
 
39 
 00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,916 And like you, he tried to bring that person back from the dead.

[machine hisses and rattles]

                47 00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,416 
Through preventing, in the origin world...

00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,333 How do you know all this? 
 
                129 00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,666 
How do you know about the origin world? 
 
130 
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,541 
I've spent 33 years looking for answers, in your world and hers. 
 
131 
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,375 
I tried to put the pieces of the puzzle together. 
 
132 
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,916 
To understand how everything 
 
133 
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,333 can continually be reborn 
from the same family tree. 
 
134 
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:48,958 
            Until I realized that we're not all part of the knot. 
 
135 
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:54,125 
          Both worlds are an ulcer that must have grown from something else. 
 
136 
 00:12:55,916 --> 00:13:00,166 If you remove it, you destroy everything that was born of it, 
 
                137 00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,208 but you keep everything alive 
that already existed in the origin world. 
 
138 
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,291 
All these years I believed 
 
139 
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,041 that she was my daughter. 
 
140 
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,166 
For a long time, 
I wished you were the father. 
 
141 
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,916 But it's better this way. 
 
142 
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,708 She isn't tied to the knot. 
 
143 
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,791 She will live. 
 
144 
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,833 
[old Claudia] But just like you and Eve, 
 
145 
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,750 
I had to preserve everything, 
 
146 
    00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,541 in order to become what I am today. 
 
147 
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,166 You know what has to be done. 
 
148 
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,708 Do it quickly. 
 
149 
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,625 Don't let her suffer. 
 
                150 00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,250 
What she's living is hardly a life. 
 
151 
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,375 It must happen... 
 
152 
        00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,666 so I'll move heaven and earth to avert it. 153 
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,583 
[old Claudia] Just like you, 
I've brought pain and suffering to others. 
 
154 
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,583 Again and again. 
 
155 
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,250 
So that my path could lead me here to you today. 
 
156 
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,166 
Everything I did 
 
157 
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,583 was for Regina. 
 
158 
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,041 
[bunker door squeaks] 
 
159 
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,791 
[old Claudia] All these years, 
I've searched in both worlds for a way 
 
160 
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,625 for her to live. 
 
161 
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,708 
          A way to break the chain of cause and effect. 
 
162 
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,958 
[melancholy string music plays] 
 
163 
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,458 
Both in your world and in Eve's 
 
164 
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,875 
  I've tried to understand how everything is connected. 
 
165 
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,625 Truly connected. 
 
166 
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,875 
Until I understood 
 
167 
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,541 that our two worlds 
were created from another. 
 
168 
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,041 
That Regina will always die in both of our worlds. 
 
169 
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,041 
That she can only live in the world which everything was created from. 
 
170 
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,000 The origin world. 
 
171 
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,916 I lied to you. 
 
172 
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,083 And to Eve. 
 
                173 00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,875 
But the knot had to stay tied. 
 
174 
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,125 
     I had to make sure you were both in the dark. 
 
175 
        00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,000 To keep everyone in this knot in the dark. 
 
176 
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,666 
Everything had to happen 
the way it always has. 
 
177 
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,125 
In your world and in hers. 
 
178 
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,750 
Every step in this labyrinth 
 
179 
  00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,041 had to be taken as it was before. 
 
180 
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:46,125 
An infinite chain of cause and effect 
 
181 
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:51,875 that repeatedly leads us 
to our same fate in both worlds. 
 
                182 00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,458 [out of breath] Excuse me. 
 
183 
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,625 You see someone come by here? 
 
184 
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,250 An old man? 
 
185 
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,583 
     [old Claudia] We do not have the free will to act in either world. 
 
186 
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,500 
        We will forever do what we have always done before. 
 
                187 00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,833 [Ulrich] Hey! 
 
188 
  00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,208 You're Helge Doppler, aren't you? 
 
                189 00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,250 [Ulrich] Helge. 
 
190 
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,750 
[old Claudia] No fate in one world 
 
191 
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,416 is better than the other. 
 
192 
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,000 What's today's date? 
 
193 
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,000 
[suspenseful music building] 
 
194 
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,166 November 8. 
 
195 
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,541 What year?

                197 00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,791 1986... 
 
                198 00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,166 
[Ulrich] I can change that, you know. 
 
                199 00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:04,250 I can change the past, and what's to come. 
 
                200 00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,083 [Helge] Help! 
 
201 
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,375 
    If you don't exist, none of this will happen.

[grunts] 
 
                205 00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,375 
What's in there? Is he in there? 
 
                206 00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,208 
[Ulrich] What did you do to him? 
 
207

[panting] 
 
209 
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,833 
[old Claudia] As long as the knot exists 
 
210 
 00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,541 we are condemned in both worlds 
 
211 
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:04,250 to feel and incite 
every act of suffering anew. 
 
212 
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,333 
[Ulrich grunts] 
 
213 
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,916 There is no difference between the two worlds. 
 
214 
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,750 
Things may not happen in the same way, 
 
215 
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,208 or at the same time, 
 
216 
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,875 but they always happen. 
 
                217 00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:33,083 
No one in this knot can escape their fate. 
 
218 
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,375 
[metallic clatter] 
 
                219 00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,250 [old Helge] It was you. 
 
220

222 
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,791 
[old Claudia] Every piece of the puzzle always finds its place. 
 
223 
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,375 
[approaching footfalls] 
 
224 
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,375 
Just like you, 
I moved the pieces around the chessboard, 
 
225 
       00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,000 and had to look on as everything happened over and over again. 
 
226 
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,166 
[wheezing] 
 
                227 00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,166 
But I finally know how to untie the knot. 
 
228 
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,208 
        I know where the loophole you've searched for all these years is. 229 
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,500 Time. 
 
230 
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:44,875 
  During the apocalypse it stood still for a fraction of a second at that point 
 
231 
       00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,208 and that threw everything out of balance. 
 
232 
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,583 
But when time stands still, 
 
233 
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,250 it also momentarily breaks 
the chain of cause and effect. 
 
234 
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,833 One can... 
 
235 
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,333 change things? 
 
236 
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,333 Eve knows that. 
 
237 
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,250 
She uses the loophole in your world 
 
238 
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,666 to send her younger self off in one direction or another, 
 
239 
    00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,958 and in doing so maintains the cycle. 
 
240 
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,666 I used it to make myself run in a different direction too, 
 
241 
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,083 to be here today. 
 
242 
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:28,791 
           You must use it to send Jonas on a different path. 
 
                243 00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,375 
To break this cycle once and for all. 
 
244 
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,291 
Jonas and Martha 
 
245 
     00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,750 are to blame for everything happening over and over again. 
 
246 
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,833 
You must send them to the origin world, 
 
247 
      00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,083 so they can finally put an end to this.

00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,208 That is our last hope.

00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:47,958 What are you saying? 
 
273 
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,250 
There is a way 
 
274 
 00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,208 that you can avoid becoming me. 
 
275 
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,583 A way where all of this never needs to happen. 
 
                 276 00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:03,291 But you, Jonas, you must trust me.

    00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,625 that I, alone, had to change things. 
 
                282 00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,791 
But it's just as much her fault. 
 
                283 00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,500 
You are two parts of the same whole.

They must go to the origin world...

                441 00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:59,666 
But instead, his own world was split. 
 
442 
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:03,541 And the knot was created. 
 
443 
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:07,958 We were created.

To get to the moment his suffering began, we'll have to travel back.

01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:56,541 And somehow... 
 
674 
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:01,041 the world had ended.

680 
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:24,750 For everything to be over.
