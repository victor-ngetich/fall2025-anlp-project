00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:42,500 
[Quell] They say,  
"Storms make a tree's roots grow deep." 
 
3 
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:48,381 
Whatever storms formed my prison, they must have been violent. 
 
4 
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,302 The roots were impenetrable. 
 
5 
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,680 There was no way out. 
 
6 
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,892 
Help me! [grunting] 
 
7 
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,227 
[screams] 
 
                 8 00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,938 
-Until I heard you. 
-[Kovacs] Who are you? 
 
9 
      00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,567 You're not leaving here in that sleeve! 
 
10 
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,777 
[gasps] 
 
                11 00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,694 [Kovacs] Quell. 
 
12 
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,950 [Quell] I had to get to you. 
 
13 
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,079 
[grunting] 
 
                14 00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,708 
It was like I was trapped in a dream. 
 
15 
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,302 I had to wake up. 
 
16 
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,388 
[grunting] 
 
17 
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,856 
[groans] 
 
18 
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,653 I don't think it was real. 
 
19 
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,282 The next thing I remember, 
I was out on the street, 
 
20 
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,370 
seeing your face on a newswave. 
 
                21 00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,665 
And all I knew was I couldn't let you die. 
 
22 
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,876 Why is that? 
 
23 
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,711 
[Kovacs] 
We knew each other a long time ago. 
 
                24 00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,630 
But my face was different back then. 
 
25 
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,342 Do you remember him? 
 
26 
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,178 
I don't. 
 
27 
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,975 
Well, maybe your stack was damaged during backup, 
 
28 
 00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,227 or the decant into this clone, 
something went wrong-- 
 
29 
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,563 
Or maybe I locked myself in a prison I deserved to be in. 
 
                30 00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,647 
-No! 
-You don't know that. 
 
31 
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,316 
You say it's nearly 300 years since I died. 
 
                32 00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,027 
Now I'm here, randomly killing Meths? 
 
33 
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,155 And I have no idea why. 
 
34 
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,447 You mentioned screaming. 
 
                35 00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,324 
You wanted to know if they heard it. 
 
36 
      00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,909 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 
                37 00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,619 
I actually saw you in a memory. 
 
38 
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,706 
You were at the Soul Market. 
 
                39 00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,708 
You scratched something into the gate. 
 
40 
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,588 Like this. 
 
                41 00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,007 
I checked the Array, there's nothing. 
 
42 
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,137 I don't know what it means. 
 
43 
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,016 What about how? 
 
44 
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,934 They think you have a weapon. 
They want it. 
 
                45 00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,562 
-They? 
-The Harlans, the Protectorate. 
 
46 
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,938 And not just them. 
 
47 
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,524 Jaeger. 
 
48 
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:12,942 He's here. 
 
49 
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,696 And wherever he goes, hell usually follows. 
 
50 
        00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,158 He won't stop until he gets what he wants. 
 
51 
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,369 
 [Batu] We've confirmed the power to the Circle 
 
52 
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,788 was overridden manually from inside the prison. 
 
                53 00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,416 
One of these techs let the Envoy escape. 
 
                54 00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,793 
I trust you'll find who it is. 
 
55 
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,005 
[Kovacs] The longer he has to hunt, the more dangerous he gets. 
 
56 
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,341 
[Batu] You're not overseeing the interrogations? 
 
57 
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,885 
Kovacs was born on this planet, he has roots here. 
 
                58 00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,553 
I'm going to dig one of 'em up. 
 
59 
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,679 
[woman grunts] 
 
                60 00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,390 [Quell] What does he want? 
 
61 
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,811 He wants payback. 
 
                62 00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,607 
He recruited me for CTAC when I was a kid. 
 
63 
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,277 
Raised me like a son when I needed 
a father and used that... 
 
64 
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,739 to make me a killer. 
 
65 
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,659 
He never forgave me for abandoning 
 
66 
 00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,702 the soldier he raised me to be. 
 
67 
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,830 Or... 
 
                68 00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,417 for finding something better. 
 
69 
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,588 We're in danger here, Quell. 
 
70 
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,341 
             I can help you, but I need to get you somewhere safe, 
 
71 
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,470 if I can get us off planet. 
 
                      72 00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,641 Do you trust me enough to come with me? 
 
73 
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,479 Yes. 
 
74 
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,361 Then I'll go. 
 
75 
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,533 
  There's only one person I know who can get both of us transfers. 
 
76 
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,703 
-I'll come with you. -No. 
 
77 
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,622 
    Your face attracts more attention than mine. 
 
                78 00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,916 
You'll understand when you remember. 
 
                79 00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,878 
Can you wait here until I get back? 
 
80 
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,473 Your human is going to die. 
 
81 
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,518 
Mr. Kovacs is recovering from his injuries at a remarkable rate. 
 
82 
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,728 Have you seen his bounty? 
 
83 
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,398 
    The whole planet's going to be hunting him. 
 
84 
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:20,194 
I assure you, this location has been scrubbed from all public record. 
 
85 
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,698 
And now that I have blanketed our digital presence, 
 
86 
    00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,743 we are as safe as proverbial houses. 
 
87 
     00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,369 That's what the Archaeologues said... 
 
88 
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,121 
right before they all died. 
 
                89 00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,372 [Trepp] Not all of 'em. 
 
90 
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,000 
Miss Trepp. How did you-- 
 
91 
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,127 This site is shielded. 
 
92 
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,505 
       [clicks tongue] Next time  you wanna drop by for a little chat, 
 
93 
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,632 you should probably remember 
to close the connection. 
 
94 
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,801 
-[sighs] 
-[Trepp] Where's Kovacs? 
 
95 
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,720 Um... 
 
96 
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,141 Mr. Kovacs is not here. 
 
97 
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,727 So, I suggest you go, hmm? 
 
                98 00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,646 
Before I'm forced to evict you. 
 
99 
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,939 
[elevator clunks] 
 
100 
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,733 Speak of the devil. 
 
101 
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,865 
Trust me. 
This is one bounty you do not want. 
 
                102 00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,076 
You're in the old Happy Face Motel. 
 
103 
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,079 And you, madam... are not. 
 
104 
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,959 Goddammit, Poe! 
 
                105 00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,421 
-No harm done, sir. 
-No harm done? 
 
                106 00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,548 
She was merely intruding as a holo-form. 
 
107 
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,009 You allowed a bounty hunter to compromise our location. 
 
108 
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,677 Now she can find us. 
 
                109 00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,181 
Which means she can find Quell. 
Do you understand that? 
 
110 
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,683 It was an oversight, yes. 
 
111 
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,311 
 Yeah, like you're not telling me this sleeve carries a bio-tracker. 
 
112 
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,522 
I shall divine her location-- 
 
113 
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,440 
No! I'll take care of it. 
 
                114 00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,443 
-I'm getting us the hell of this rock. 
-[hologram buzzes] 
 
115 
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,864 
Sir, I implore you, it is imprudent to go beyond these walls. 
 
116 
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,241 It's Harlan's Day. 
 
117 
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,411 
 The streets are teeming with people, not to mention police, Protectorate-- 
 
                118 00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,621 
-Who the hell are you? 
-I'm Dig 301. 
 
119 
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,331 
-I'm--  
-Yeah, you're a service AI. 
 
                120 00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,542 
So you're bound by confidentiality, right? 
 
121 
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,711 Only if I'm paid. 
 
122 
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,463 Right. 
 
123 
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:07,885 You're hired. 
 
                124 00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,389 
Make sure my friend upstairs stays safe. 
 
125 
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,732 
I'll no longer be in need 
of your services. 
 
126 
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,617 
Poe, I didn't mean to-- 
 
127 
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,618 It was not you. 
 
128 
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,912 It was me. 
 
                129 00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,296 
The Nevermore is now in your hands. 
 
130 
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,594 
[upbeat music playing] 
 
                131 00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,064 
[man shouts] I can't hear you! Amazing! 
 
                132 00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,900 [crowd] Harlan's Day! 
 
                133 00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,193 [man] Say what? 
 
                134 00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,278 
[crowd shouts louder] Harlan's Day! 
 
135 
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,745 
[man speaking indistinctly] 
 
136 
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,800 
[automated voice] Needlecast passengers, 
 
137 
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,803 please be advised 
that all private casting gates are closed. 
 
138 
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,016 What is that smell? 
 
139 
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,018 
Desperation, 
 
140 
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,396 nutrient bath, body odor. 
 
                141 00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,482 
I don't see why we have to be here. 
 
142 
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,736 
 It's tradition to welcome the original  Founders on Harlan's Day. You know this. 
 
143 
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,531 
No tradition is worth setting foot in a public station. 
 
                144 00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,658 
Especially not for that arrogant gasbag. 
 
145 
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,576 Dugan! 
 
                146 00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,954 
So good to see you in the flesh. 
 
                147 00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,790 You remember my partner, Jarek? 
 
148 
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,793 
     I would have preferred a private needlecast facility. 
 
                149 00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,336 [Danica] Just a precaution. 
 
150 
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,214 
I've restricted all transit to one location. 
 
151 
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,716 
If the Envoy tries to run, we'll have him. 
 
                152 00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,885 
You assume he's running, Danica. 
For all we know, 
 
153 
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,512 
he's lining up his next victim. 
 
154 
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,306 
And you should have canceled this ridiculous holiday. 
 
155 
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,102 
  Gathering so many Meths together is foolish under the circumstances. 
 
156 
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,604 Harlan's Day has been celebrated every year 
 
157 
    00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,690 since my father founded this planet. 
 
                158 00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,110 We founded this planet, Danica. Konrad liked to leave that part out too. 
 
                159 00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,029 
-[girl] I don't wanna go. 
-[man] Just for a-- 
 
                160 00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,865 
-[girl] Don't make me. 
-Listen, you'll be safer on Latimer. 
 
                161 00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,285 -Okay, you'll get a new sleeve. 
-I don't want a new sleeve! 
 
                162 00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,495 
Her departure's scheduled right now. 
Get her moving. 
 
                163 00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,330 
-[girl] No! 
-What's the hold up here? 
 
164 
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,416 
    Governor. I-- I mean, the brat won't move, ma'am. 
 
                165 00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,586 
Hey, give her a minute, all right? 
She's scared. 
 
166 
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,299 
Is that right? 
Are you scared to be without your father? 
 
167 
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,220 I know what that's like. 
 
168 
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,223 Can I give you some advice? 
 
169 
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,351 Fear holds you back. 
 
170 
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,980 
It keeps from you seeing the world as it is. 
 
171 
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,692 
Many men, much older than you, never get past it. 
 
172 
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,236 
But if you're strong, 
 
173 
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,698 if you allow yourself 
to let your fear go... 
 
174 
 00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,410 nothing can stand in your way. 
 
                175 00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,664 
[whispers] If you love your father... 
 
176 
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,500 grow beyond him. 
 
177 
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,684 Governor, thank you. 
 
178 
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,437 Goodbyes are never easy. 
 
179 
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:50,858 Hmm. 
 
180 
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,986 Cute speech. Now, can we go? 
 
181 
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,675 Do I know you, Colonel... 
 
182 
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:16,967 Carrera. 
 
                183 00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,930 
I'm here about the Last Envoy. 
I understand you and he have a history. 
 
184 
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,723 Have you heard from him? 
 
                185 00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,351 
I haven't heard of a Colonel Carrera. 
 
186 
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,397 Have you never made your mark on this world or any other? 
 
187 
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,275 
Fame is a fool's idea of glory. 
I prefer to simply succeed. 
 
                188 00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,612 
Perhaps your glory is one left unfinished. 
 
189 
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:42,535 
The Last Envoy rose from the darkness of eternal storage, 
 
190 
      00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,122 pardoned by the Protectorate you serve. 
 
                191 00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,333 
His name lives, as does his legend. 
 
192 
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,839 
        Does it gall you to hear his name spoken again? 
 
193 
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,674 The one that got away. 
 
                194 00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,973 [Carrera] Nice tree. 
 
195 
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,437 
     We have cut down so many, yet we barely know what they are. 
 
196 
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,569 
[snaps] 
 
197 
  00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,447 I could have you killed for that. 
 
198 
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,365 And I can have you erased. 
 
                199 00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,076 
What makes you think you have the power? 200 00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,745 
I'm the man who burned Innenin. 
 
                201 00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,872 
The man who hunted down Munharto. 
 
202 
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,667 
The man who destroyed Stronghold and brought down Falconer. 
 
203 
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,085 You see... 
 
204 
 00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,798 you don't need to know my name 
once you know what I've done. 
 
205 
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,675 What I'm capable of. 
 
206 
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,846 
Kovacs may have played the loyal soldier and taken a fall on your behalf, 
 
                207 00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,765 but make no mistake, old man. 
 
208 
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,728 
I can destroy you so utterly, nothing will be left. 
 
209 
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,732 No name, no family, no life. 
 
                210 00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,694 
-[Tanaseda] Unless? 
-You find him, bring him to me. 
 
211 
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,071 Then you and yours survive. 212 
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,786 
         Takeshi Kovacs has a way  of costing people everything they have. 
 
213 
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,079 Ask yourself... 
 
214 
 00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,792 do you want to be one of them? 
 
215 
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,889 
[upbeat music playing] 
 
216 
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:38,442 
Those magnet hands of yours twitch and I blow a hole in your spine. 
 
217 
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,653 You never said goodbye. 
 
218 
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,862 We'll say it now. 
 
219 
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,283 
                Nice try, but I knew what I was walking into. 
 
220 
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,079 
   [chuckles] That Envoy intuition doesn't seem to be working too well. 
 
221 
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,082 
  I don't have time for you to hunt me all day, I have somewhere I need to be. 
 
                222 00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,584 
-So, let's make a deal. 
-You don't have shit I want. 
 
223 
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,336 Anil Imani. 
 
224 
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:03,843 
  I might be high on the bounty board, but Anil jumped from 256 to number four 
 
225 
    00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,178 the same day I gave you five stacks. 
 
226 
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,889 So I'm guessing he's family. 
 
227 
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,349 A brother? 
 
228 
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,978 Yeah, that's Envoy intuition. 
 
229 
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,648 
Total absorption of details and that's how I'll find him if you'll let me. 
 
                230 00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,027 
Fuck, the cops are headed this way. 
 
231 
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,697 
You better make a decision fast before they make it for you. 
 
232 
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,574 Come on. 
 
                233 00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,874 
[child over intercom] What's the password? 
 
234 
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,961 
The password is "you're grounded." Open the door. 
 
235 
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,170 Now! 
 
236 
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,632 
You're no fun, Mom. 
 
                237 00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,595 
TJ, do you think this is a game? 
 
                238 00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,142 
You are lucky that those cops kept going. 
What are you thinking? 
 
239 
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,021 
Sorry, I got bored. Mom's been making me hang decorations all day. 
 
                240 00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,942 
That's better than what I'll do to you. 
Come on. Finish helping. 
 
241 
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,952 [Kovacs] So that's your kid? 
 
                242 00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,830 
But not in his original sleeve. 
 
243 
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,168 
   Based on his coordination, I'd say he's been in this one for about a year. 
 
                       244 00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,838 -Maybe more if he has War Shock Syndrome? 
-You don't know my kid. 
 
245 
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,632 I don't, but I know the look. 
 
246 
     00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,259 He knows bad things can happen to him. 
 
247 
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,387 
What happened? 
He get caught in a cross fire? 
 
248 
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,016 
He stepped on a mine. 
 
249 
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,020 And blew up. 
 
250 
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,524 
                    [Kovacs]  You're renting a kid's sleeve on Harlan's. 
 
251 
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,692 
[laughs] 
 
                252 00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,112 
That monthly lease must be high as hell. 
 
253 
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,783 
And you're still putting all that credit on Anil. 
 
254 
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,618 
    Won't be a problem once I reap your bounty. 
 
                255 00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,454 
Then you can't use me to find him. 
 
256 
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,500 
You might be the best bounty hunter in the Settled Worlds, 
 
257 
     00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,627 but you don't have the training I do. 
 
258 
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,587 So... 
 
259 
  00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,801 ask me again to be your partner. 
 
                260 00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,306 
You better not be fucking with me, Kovacs. 261 
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,724 I'm not. 
 
262 
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,276 So, we good? 
 
                      263 00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,200 -Wait. How am I supposed to contact you? 
-Don't worry. 
 
264 
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,202 I'll be in touch. 
 
265 
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,913 Happy Harlan's Day. 
 
266 
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,957 
[door closes] 
 
267 
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,878 
  [Danica] On a cryoship, stocked with human embryos, 
 
268 
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,716 
Konrad Harlan and his crew set forth for a new home. 
 
269 
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,967 Their destination? 
 
270 
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,681 
        A planet ringed by Orbitals, remnants of an extinct alien civilization. 
 
271 
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,226 But Konrad detected a hole in the planet's defenses... 
 
                272 00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,811 "I shall die. 
 
273 
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,774 I must die... 
 
274 
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,945 of this fool's sickness. 
 
                275 00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,240 
In this way and only this way... 
 
276 
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,535 
[whispers] I shall be lost." 
 
277 
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,955 
[Danica] ...but in the end, he was richly rewarded, 
 
                278 00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,458 discovering the largest cache of Elder artifacts 
 
279 
 00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,626 ever found in a Settled World. 
 
                      280 00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,588 -[Dig] Where's the human first aid kit? 
-Behind the bar. 
 
281 
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,967 
 [Danica] Konrad and his team began exploring the terrain... 
 
282 
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,677 This is just whiskey. 
 
283 
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,055 There's also gin. 
 
284 
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,807 
[Danica] 
In time, Archaeologues and their AI's 
 
285 
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,186 
oversaw excavation of these artifacts on a massive scale. 
 
286 
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:48,108 
      Melted down, they provide the alloy necessary to make stacks.  
 
287 
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,236 Hmm. "I have no fear of pain. 
 
                288 00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,782 
Only the fear of its result... 
 
289 
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,618 of terror." 
 
290 
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,620 
That's enough of that 
 
291 
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,955 and enough of this. 
 
                292 00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,334 
Why not leave me to my despair, Miss Dig? 
 
293 
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,675 
My glitch has rendered me useless as an empty bottle. 
 
294 
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,138 
None of this would have happened if I'd rebooted. 
 
295 
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,099 The tracker... 
 
296 
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,726 the Circle... 
 
297 
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,395 the bounty hunter. 
 
                  298 00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,109 -Mr. Kovacs was right to fire me. 
-Mr. Kovacs is an ass. 
 
299 
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,530 
And yet you still avail yourself of my old mantle. 
 
                300 00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,406 
Poe, the Archaeologues are gone. 
 
                301 00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,534 
No one is interested in Elder history. 
 
302 
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,661 
  I know what it's like to be without a purpose. 
 
                303 00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,372 
The crushing madness of idle hours. 
 
304 
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:48,043 
   The decades upon decades of shuffling about aimlessly! 
 
305 
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,378 I have lived it! 
 
306 
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,712 I have too! 
 
307 
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,881 I need this. 
 
                308 00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,553 
A Dig is nothing without a dig. 
 
309 
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,392 Yes. 
 
310 
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,814 
And a hotel is nothing without a guest. 
 
311 
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,574 I know what I must do. 
 
                312 00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,583 
I just have to find the resolve. 
 
                313 00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,064 
-I need to see him. 
-He's in a meeting. 
 
314 
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,319 I can wait. 
 
315 
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,791 No hard feelings, huh? 
 
                316 00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,544 
[Yukito] You shouldn't have come back. 
 
317 
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,049 
  You impose like your family, but Tanaseda isn't your father. 
 
318 
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,550 Relax, Yukito. 
 
319 
   00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,510 I'm not here for your inheritance. 
 
320 
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,387 I've had enough of fathers. 
 
                321 00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,567 
[Jaeger] I see potential. 
I can make something else. 
 
322 
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,119 We protect. 
 
323 
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,496 You have my word. 
 
324 
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,749 
[birds chirping] 
 
                  325 00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,877 
[Jaeger] I know what you're thinking. 
 
                  326 00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,174 -But the Protectorate can't fix ugly. 
-[Kovacs Prime] Fuck you. 
 
327 
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,510 
[both laugh] 
 
328 
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,679 Good to see you. 
 
                   329 00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,183 -[sighs] How long have I been down? -A while. 
 
330 
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,311 
-Your last mission-- 
-Went sideways, I know. 
 
331 
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,730 
         I've had enough of this VR recuperation suite. 
 
332 
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,232 I'm ready to get back out. 
 
333 
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,985 Just like me. 
 
334 
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,279 Relentless. 
 
335 
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,198 
So, you're gonna tell me? 
What's with the birth sleeve? 
 
336 
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,158 
You'll be glad to have it where you're going. 
 
337 
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,159 Where's that? 
 
338 
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,995 Harlan's. 
 
339 
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,914 You're going home, son. 
 
340 
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,461 
[woman screaming] 
 
                341 00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,338 
-Any progress? 
-Not yet, sir. 
 
342 
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,967 
We've been at it for hours, no one's talking. 
 
343 
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,553 They'll talk for me. 
 
                344 00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,435 
[Danica] No, put those in the kitchen. 
 
345 
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,981 
Stone, the fireworks-- 
 
346 
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,692 
Are being loaded in to the rockets as we speak. 
 
                347 00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,819 
-They'll be ready. 
-Good. 
 
348 
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,289 
Looks like it's gonna be quite the spectacle. 
 
349 
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:18,462 
I decided it was time to stop mourning my father's absence. 
 
350 
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,548 
  With the ceasefire, people wanna celebrate. 
 
                  351 00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,884 You mean, you need a distraction. 
 
352 
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,054 
Well, I'm sorry to say I don't think some wine and pretty lights 
 
353 
   00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,973 are gonna make people forget about that parade of ineptitude 
 
354 
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,641 you called an execution. 
 
                355 00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,519 
Thank you for that assessment. 
 
356 
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,105 Maybe if you were here for more than 24 hours, 
 
357 
   00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,899 I'd give your opinion more weight. 
 
                358 00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,692 
That's what I've come to tell you. 
 
359 
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,027 I'm staying. 
 
360 
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,365 
I think it best I'm here in case anything else gets out of hand. 
 
                361 00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,242 
I wanted you to hear it from me. 
 
362 
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,120 Is that some kind of threat? 
 
                363 00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,707 
There's no shame in needing help, Danica. 
It was ambitious... 
 
364 
   00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,503 stepping into your father's shoes, 
but I think we both know they don't fit. 
 
365 
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,964 I'll see you tonight. 
 
366 
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,385 
I'm sure you'll find a way to top yourself again. 
 
367 
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,822 
[hologram buzzes] 
 
                368 00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,281 [Poe] Miss Falconer. 
 
                369 00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,202 
I am Poe, your humble proprietor. 
 
370 
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:36,415 
Former proprietor. 
I brought some refreshment. 
 
371 
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,543 May I? 
372 
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,795 Thank you. 
 
                373 00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,923 
Have we met before last night? 
 
374 
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,383 Not officially. 
 
375 
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:51,430 
          But I feel like we've been travel companions for quite some time now. 
 
376 
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,682 
Seems like everyone knows me better than I know myself. 
 
377 
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,895 That is partly why I'm here. 
 
                378 00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,276 
I find myself somewhat at a crossroads. 
 
379 
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,237 
Mr. Kovacs always took comfort in your counsel. 
 
380 
 00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,824 And I was wondering if I might  have some of the same clarity. 
 
381 
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:14,035 
I'm not sure what you mean. 
Mr. Kovacs and I have been worlds apart. 
 
382 
     00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,998 How could I have offered him counsel? 
 
383 
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,714 
Is it so hard to believe that he carries a piece of you with him? 
                384 00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,510 
You have a way with words, Mr. Poe. 
 
                385 00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,054 
-[echoing] You have a way with words... 
-[ticking] 
 
386 
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,475 A way with... 
 
387 
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,354 Miss Falconer. 
 
388 
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,647 Oh.  
                   389 00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,651 -Forgive me. I have disturbed you. -Wait. 
 
390 
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,904 You came with a question. 
 
391 
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,905 Ask it. 
 
392 
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,493 Do you miss her? 
 
393 
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,661 The woman you once were... 
 
394 
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,582 who you no longer remember. 
 
395 
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,879 It's like missing land... 
 
396 
      00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,133 when you swim out too far into the sea. 397 
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,346 
It's beneath you in the deep, out of reach. 
 
398 
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,933 As you float above it... 
 
399 
   00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,561 you can't touch it, and yet still, 
 
400 
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,231 it's there. 
 
401 
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,777 I think I understand. 
 
402 
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,654 
Thank you 
 
403 
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,405 for making it poetry. 
 
                404 00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,450 
[Quell] May I ask you something? 
 
405 
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,868 Of course. Anything. 
 
                406 00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,246 
I need to run a search on the Array. 
 
                407 00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,540 
What is the subject of your inquiry? 
 
408 
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,708 I need to know who I was. 
 
409 
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,211 You can understand that. 
 
410 
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,755 Can't you? 
 
                411 00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,010 
I'll leave you to your privacy. 
 
412 
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,684 Do you recognize this? 
 
413 
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,607 I'll look into it. 
 
                414 00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,236 
-Is that what you came for? 
-No. I need transit off planet. 
 
415 
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,737 For me and her. 
 
416 
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,281 Tonight. 
 
                417 00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,660 
[Tanaseda] False identities for you both. 
 
                418 00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,746 
Two sleeves waiting upon your arrival. 
 
419 
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,792 
     With the new restrictions, the Governor would have to approve 
 
420 
  00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,544 the last minute cast-off herself. 
 
421 
    00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,047 Your request is next to impossible. 
 
422 
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,258 
It's safest for everyone if I take her away. 
 
                423 00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,844 
Not if they learned I enabled your escape. 
 
424 
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,764 A man came to see me today. 
 
425 
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:41,891 Carrera. 
 
                426 00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,603 
-What did he want? 
-Your life. 
 
427 
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,147 Did you give it to him? 
 
                428 00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,027 
Some debts must be paid in kind. 
 
429 
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,529 Blood for blood. 
 
                430 00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,115 
You are not my only concern, Takeshi. 
 
431 
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,366 But she is mine. 
 
                432 00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,288 
I've already betrayed one person today. 
 
433 
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:13,423 
Immortality means an eternity of living with what we've done. 
 
                434 00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,469 
I've lived with enough regret. 
Haven't you? 
 
435 
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,104 
I will get you your transfers, 
your identities, and your sleeves. 
 
436 
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,022 At what price? 
 
                437 00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,733 
Remember what I said the last we spoke. 
 
                438 00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,737 
That in time, even loves turns to dust. 
 
439 
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,573 The price is... 
 
440 
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,034 prove me wrong. 
 
441 
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,706 
[newscaster] To commemorate Harlan's Day, we are taking a look back 
 
442 
     00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:51,169 at some of the darker challenges that 
Governor Harlan faced during his reign. 
 
443 
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,173 
On this very day in history, almost 300 years ago, 
 
444 
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,802 
     Millsport was rocked with one of the most violent Quellist attacks. 
 
445 
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,430 
Terrorist leader, Quellcrist Falconer, along with her army of Envoys, 
 
446 
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,308 raided the planet's main alloy shipping facility. 
 
447 
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,853 
     The building was destroyed  and numerous Protectorate officials 
 
448 
        00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,106 as well as innocent civilians were killed. 
 
449 
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,401 Good news. We're casting off. 
We just need approval. 
 
450 
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,487 Why didn't you tell me? 
 
451 
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,783 
...nothing could be done to stop the woman determined to bring back death. 
 
                452 00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,827 
It's just Protectorate propaganda. 
 
453 
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,704 Terrorist. Murderer. 
 
454 
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,956 Is this who you want back? 
 
455 
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,417 I'm a monster. 
 
456 
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,336 
     [Kovacs] No. That's just what they want people to believe. 
 
457 
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,754 I wanna bring back death? 
 
                458 00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,425 
You want humanity to live, not just exist. 
 
459 
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,011 
      If you wanna know who Quellcrist Falconer is, 460 
 00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,722 take it from someone who knows. 
 
461 
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,850 You're a scientist. 
 
462 
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,060 You're a warrior. A leader. 
 
463 
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,231 
     You created stacks so you could see the stars. 
 
464 
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,151 
You've shared the knowledge so we could do the same. 
 
                465 00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,987 
We took what you made and twisted it. 
 
466 
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,573 You were never the monster. 
 
467 
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,283 We were. 
 
468 
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,994 
       But the Protectorate couldn't admit that and survive. 
 
469 
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,246 
Maybe not everything I'm blamed for is true, 
 
470 
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,582 but I killed those Meths. 
 
471 
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,126 What if it happens again? 
 
472 
 00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,670 -What if next time I hurt you? 
-You won't. 
 
473 
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,048 
       You found me at my worst and saw something no one else could. 
 
474 
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,514 The boy inside the man. 
 
                475 00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,601 
When I see the boy inside the man. 
 
                476 00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,729 
[Kovacs] I can't stop looking at you. 
You're the one who set me free. 
 
477 
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,440 I said that to you before? 
 
478 
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,525 You did. 
 
                479 00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,903 
On the bridge. Do you remember? 
 
480 
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,906 I remember feeling... 
 
481 
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,243 this feeling. 
 
482 
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,052 
[gasps] 
 
483 
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,637 
[screams] 
 
484 
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,721 
[gasps] 
 
                485 00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,223 
-We can stop. -No! 
 
486 
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,474 Please. 
 
487 
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,809 Keep me here. 
 
488 
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,941 
[moans] 
 
489 
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,488 
-[soft music playing] 
-[indistinct chatter] 
 
490 
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,370 -[woman] Great party, Danica. 
-Thank you. 
 
491 
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,371 It's going well. 
 
492 
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,750 [sighs] It's a pit of vipers. 
 
                 493 00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,044 Look at them all, writhing away. 
 
                 494 00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,506 
[Jarek] Relax. This is your night. 
 
495 
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,174 
And when it's over, 
 
496 
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,926 I have a surprise. 
 
                497 00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,728 [Danica sighs] Shit. 
 
498 
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,900 Tanaseda Hideki. 
 
499 
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,612 
I don't recall your name on the guest list. 
 
500 
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,866 
And yet you invited me when you shut down all private casting on planet. 
 
501 
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,286 
The main hub's backed up. 
Apparently, the only way to get through 
 
502 
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,705 is with direct authorization  from the Governor. 
 
                503 00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,833 
Do I look like a travel agent? 
 
                504 00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,004 
Leave a request with my assistant. 
I'll send a reply in the morning. 
 
                505 00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,506 
That won't do. The matter's urgent. 
 
506 
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,595 
     Then again, I could stay and make a toast to your father. 
 
507 
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,890 
Konrad always enjoyed a good story, 
 
508 
     00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,101 though he might not appreciate the one I have to tell. 
 
509 
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,686 
How many passes? 
 
510 
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,980 Two blind transfers. 
 
511 
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,777 There. It's done. 
 
                512 00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,738 
Now go before I have you thrown out. 
 
513 
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,660 
-Small gift for your father. 
-How am I supposed to get that to him? 
 
                514 00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,495 
I'm sure you can think of a way. 
 
                515 00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,209 
[Dugan] Tanaseda. 
What, are you party crashing? 
 
516 
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,336 How criminal of you. 
 
                517 00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,713 
My honor's intact, unlike yours. 
 
518 
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,467 
[Dugan] 
Always a downer, some things never change. 
 
519 
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,513 
  What was that? I saw you writing sweet nothings to the Governor, now? 
 
                520 00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,431 
I don't have time to catch up. 
 
                521 00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,600 
It's just as well, you shouldn't be here. 522 
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,146 
   With what we've done, none of us should be here. 
 
                523 00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,441 
You, of all people, know that. 
 
524 
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,587 
[sighs] 
 
525 
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,718 -[whispers] What now? Mm-hmm. 
-You told me to keep an eye on Carrera. 
 
526 
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:35,972 
    He's been rounding up the techs that work in the prison, in Sector B. 
 
                527 00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,559 
-What does he know? 
-Nothing yet. 
 
528 
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,228 
He's looking for whoever it was that was helping the Envoy. 
 
                529 00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,231 
Sector B is for political prisoners. 
 
530 
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,692 
     Do you know what'll happen if Carrera gets a wind of a rumor? 
 
531 
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,865 
It's bad enough I have Dugan breathing down my neck. 
 
                532 00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,742 
Okay. What do you want me to do? 
 
533 
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,952 I'll handle it. 
 
534 
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,166 
[woman screaming] 
 
535 
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,297 
[crying] 
 
536 
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,845 
[Carrera] I've gotta hand it to you, Lila, you're tough. 
 
537 
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,765 
That's one of the things I most respect about women. 
 
538 
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,935 
Some people say interrogating them is easy work, but truth is, 
 
539 
  00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,522 a woman can endure much more pain than the average man. 
 
540 
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,733 Just ask them. 
 
541 
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,321 I want water. 
 
542 
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,407 Doesn't matter what you want. 
 
                543 00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,660 
Then why would I ever confess? 
 
544 
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,287 I don't need you to confess. 
 
545 
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,831 
Your friends already told me you cut the power. 
 
546 
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,375 What I want to know is... 
 
547 
   00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,880 why would somebody as smart as you 
 
548 
    00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:55,343 do something as monumentally stupid 
as helping Takeshi Kovacs escape? 
 
549 
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,638 I wasn't helping him. 
 
550 
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,681 I was helping her. 
 
                551 00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,726 
You threw your life away for a synth. 
 
552 
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,561 I saw her blood. 
 
553 
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,396 It was as red as mine. 
 
554 
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,607 
She was real. [breathing heavily] 
 
                555 00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,526 
Unlike most things on this planet. 
 
556 
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,152 
[Lila grunts] 
 
557 
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,406 
-[gulps] 
-What's that supposed to mean? 
 
                558 00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,910 
It's not my first time in this room. 
[breathing heavily] 
 
559 
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,832 
I have seen countless prisoners tortured here. 
 
560 
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,209 I've heard their screams. 
 
561 
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,294 Heard their bones break. 
 
562 
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,923 
[whispering]  
I've also heard what they've said. 
 
563 
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,300 And what was that? 
 
564 
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,803 Ask the Governor. 
 
                565 00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,181 
Ask her about this fucking war. 
 
566 
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,433 
-[screams]  
-I'm asking you! 
 
567 
     00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,104 I want to know exactly what you heard. 
 
568 
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,438 
[panting] 
 
                569 00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,484 
It doesn't matter what you want. 
 
570 
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,154 
-[groans, screams] 
-[door opens] 
 
571 
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,825 
Colonel, this prisoner is being moved along with the others. 
 
                572 00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,660 
What the fuck are you talking about? 
 
573 
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,703 
[laughs] 
 
574 
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,829 The fuck she is. 
 
575 
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,539 On who's authority? 
 
576 
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,207 Orders from Danica Harlan. 
 
577 
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,211 
[Lila laughing] 
 
578 
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,108 
[rattling] 
 
579 
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,349 
[rattling stops] 
 
                580 00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,023 [Lizzie] Hello, Eddie. 
 
581 
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,984 Hello, Miss Elizabeth. 
 
                582 00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,861 
Feels like you've only been gone a day. 
 
583 
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,781 Or is it forever? 
 
584 
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,992 
I still get mixed up sometimes. 
 
585 
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,077 
[Poe laughs] 
 
586 
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,287 Believe me, I understand. 
 
587 
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,541 
   I was lost in darkness,  no one could find me, but... 
 
588 
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,001 you did. 
 
                589 00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,296 
Because you see what people really need. 
 
                590 00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,924 
Miss Elizabeth, I must tell you something. 
 
                591 00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,926 
You're more human than most humans I know. 
 
592 
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,844 The best of us. 
 
593 
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,264 Of all of the wild beauty... 
 
594 
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,724 distant stars... 
 
                595 00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,604 
-I will miss you most. 
-[Lizzie] No matter where you are... 
 
596 
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,107 never forget that. 
 
597 
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,108 
Miss Dig. 
 
                598 00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,069 [Dig] I heard voices. 
 
599 
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,904 I was worried. 
 
                   600 00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,700 -Aren't you going to introduce us? -Ah. 
 
601 
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,952 I would. 
 
602 
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,078 Except... 
 
603 
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,539 Hello, Eddie. 
 
                604 00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,875 
Feels like you've only been gone a day. 
 
605 
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,669 
Or is it-- 
 
                   606 00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,840 It is merely a holo-recording, hmm. 
 
607 
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,843 
Parting message from a very dear friend 
 
608 
  00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,804 before Mr. Kovacs and I cast off from Bay City. 
 
609 
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,350 You were saying goodbye. 
 
610 
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:33,936 
Mm-hmm. 
 
611 
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,982 I am resolved. 
 
612 
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,407 You're rebooting? 
 
613 
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,827 
But you could lose everything, your entire history. 
 
614 
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,787 
   I have no interest in returning to disuse. 
 
                615 00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,540 
My condition will only worsen until I... 
 
616 
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,170 deteriorate completely. 
 
617 
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,047 It's inevitable. 
 
618 
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,299 What if it wasn't? 
 
619 
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,218 
When I worked for the Archaeologues, 
 
620 
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,055 
I designed an intricate database to catalog their findings. 
 
621 
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,891 What if I could build one to preserve your memories? 
 
                622 00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,894 -Parse them from corrupt data. 
-You think that's possible? 
 
623 
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,896 It would take time. 
 
624 
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,566 You're very kind, Miss Dig. 
 
                    625 00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,153 -But I couldn't possibly burden you. 
-It's not a burden. 
 
626 
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,489 It's what I was made for. 
 
                627 00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,324 
-I'm not a bell boy. 
-A bell boy. 
 
628 
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,575 I'm an archivist. 
 
629 
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,661 
And some things, some people, 
 
630 
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,997 are worth preserving. 
 
631 
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,757 
-[indistinct chatter] 
-[upbeat music playing] 
 
632 
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,476 Carrera, you came after all. 
 
                633 00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,021 
Don't tell me, you caught the Meth-killer. 
 
634 
  00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,357 Where are my prisoners, Governor? 
 
635 
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,028 
-What do you mean? 
-You gave the order. Rescind it. 
 
636 
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,782 
Unless you wanna tell me what it is you're hiding about the war. 
 
637 
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,536 There is no war, Colonel. 
 
                638 00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,873 
You were authorized to bring in the Envoy. 
Anything else is mission creep. 
 
639 
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,459 There was a conspirator who helped them escape. 
 
640 
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,086 I was interrogating them. 
 
641 
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,131 The conspirators, yes. 
 
642 
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,841 Governor, excuse me. 
 
643 
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,260 Uh, it is time for the toast. 
 
644 
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,095 My apologies. 
 
645 
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,223 
We'll have to continue this later, but stick around. 
 
                646 00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,434 
I've a feeling you'll enjoy the fireworks. 
 
647 
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,440 
[glass clinking] 
 
648 
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,193 Greetings, everyone. 
 
                649 00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,404 
Thank you all so much for coming. 
 
650 
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:54,201 
Tonight, we commemorate the miracle  of the colony ship landing. 
 
651 
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,328 
The fact is, 
 
                652 00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,457 we never should have made it, 
we should have been blown to bits. 
 
653 
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,499 
[crowd laughs] 
 
654 
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,710 Where are the fireworks? 
 
                    655 00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,795 -[Danica] After all, the Orbitals... 
-They're out back, sir. 
 
656 
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,048 
[Danica] ...will strike down anything that dares to fly among the angels. 
 
657 
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,178 
But every shield has its weak point, and let me tell you, 
 
658 
   00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,054 we Harlans are good at finding it. 
 
659 
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,973 
-[device beeps] 
-Change of plans. 
 
660 
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,933 
[Danica] That is the spirit of Harlan's Day. 
 
661 
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,310 Bring transport around now. 
 
662 
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,063 
 [Danica] My father threaded his ship through a tiny hole over the equator. 
 
                663 00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,358 
-[Carrera] What's going on? 
-This is a restricted area! [grunts] 
 
                664 00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,195 
[Danica] His daring, his skills... 
 
                665 00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,071 [Carrera] Untie her. 
 
666 
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:36,160 
      ...refusal to back down, that's the spirit of Harlan's Day. 
 
667 
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,536 
I said, "Untie her!" 
 
                     668 00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,082 -[Danica] So let us always remember... 
-[Carrera] Let go of me! 
 
669 
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:46,629 
...it's the difficult choices made against the steepest of odds 
 
670 
  00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,964 that yield the greatest triumph. 
 
671 
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,092 
-[Carrera shouts] Untie her! 
-[Danica] And it's in that spirit 
 
                672 00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,095 that I give to you tonight... 
 
673 
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,263 
[screaming] 
 
674 
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,600 
[Danica] 
...the gift and bane of Harlan's World. 
 
675 
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,357 Angelfire. 
 
676 
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,036 
[loud buzzing] 
 
677 
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,871 
[loud popping] 
 
678 
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,541 Happy Harlan's Day! 
 
                679 00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,918 
[crowd shouts] Happy Harlan's Day! 
 
680 
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,433 
[fireworks exploding in distance] 
 
681 
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,315 
[device beeping] 
 
682 
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,990 I've made the arrangements. 
 
683 
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,783 Our business is concluded. 
 
684 
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,076 
Oyabun, what's wrong? 
 
685 
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,869 Forgive her. 
 
686 
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,880 
[in Japanese] 
Arrows and bullets all spent, 
 
687 
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,092 with sadness we fall, 
 
                688 00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,470 but unless I smite the enemy, 
 
689 
  00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:23,392 my body cannot rot in the field. 
 
                690 00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,567 [in English] Will it hurt? 
 
691 
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,902 Only if I wish it. 
 
692 
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,531 It would be what I deserve. 
 
                693 00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,911 
None of us gets what we deserve. 
 
694 
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,229 
[crowd cheering] 
 
                695 00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,446 
Put me down. I wanna get down. 
 
696 
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,996 
[club music playing] 
 
697 
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,334 Hey. The show finished? 
 
698 
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,211 Yeah. 
 
699 
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,049 
Hey, what's wrong? 
You didn't enjoy the fireworks? 
 
700 
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,093 They sounded like bombs. 
 
                701 00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,304 
[Trepp] Yeah, well, you know what? 
 
702 
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,181 I don't like 'em either. 
 
703 
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,686 You're okay. 
 
704 
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,146 I've got you. 
 
                705 00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,149 
Looks like someone's ready for bed. 
Go pack up your stuff, okay? 
 
                706 00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,651 
-Go on. Go. -Okay. 
 
707 
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,785 Look, can we talk? 
 
708 
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,414 
        You have hardly said more than two words to me all day. 
 
709 
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,873 What do you want me to say? 
 
710 
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,750 
You said were gonna reap the Envoy, 
 
711 
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,169 but instead you made a deal 
that put our lives in danger. 
 
                712 00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,422 
-And for what? 
-For my brother. 
 
713 
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,677 
Takeshi Kovacs is the most wanted man on all of Harlan's. 
 
                714 00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,178 
You could get yourself killed. 
 
715 
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,895 Do you remember when we met? 
 
716 
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,731 Yeah. 
 
717 
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,817 
There was a bounty on you. 
First one I couldn't turn in. 
 
718 
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,237 
All the other Archaeologues had been murdered or chased off the planet 
 
719 
     00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,991 and all I wanted to do was find them. 
But do you remember what you said to me? 
 
                720 00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,538 
I said you had a choice to make. 
 
721 
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,833 
You could spend your life on the living or cash out with the dead. 
 
722 
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:53,792 That's right. 
 
723 
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:58,130 
So I got a shitty job in a shitty bar that pays like shit 
 
724 
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:02,092 and I chose to keep living 
with you and with TJ. 
 
725 
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,348 
I just keep waiting for you to make the same choice. 
 
726 
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,603 
[device ringing] 
 
727 
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,737 Sorry. 
 
728 
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,405 Yeah? 
 
729 
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,824 I need your help. 
 
730 
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,788 Send me the address. 
 
                731 00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,007 [Jarek] That went well. 
 
732 
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,764 I told you I had a surprise. 
 
                733 00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,266 
[chuckles] Jarek, what are you doing? 
 
734 
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,185 Come on. 
735 
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,814 
I saw the way you looked at him back at the casting station. 
 
736 
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:03,153 
       It's against the law to steal someone else's sleeve. 
 
737 
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:09,451 
-[sighs] 
-Then I guess you'll have to punish me. 
 
738 
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,458 -[Danica sighs, laughs] -Come on. 
 
                739 00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,253 
We can put him back when we're done. 
 
740 
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,129 He won't know the difference. 
 
741 
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,678 
[moans] 
 
742 
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,430 It is Harlan's Day. 
 
743 
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,307 
[chuckles] 
 
744 
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,355 Did you find the prisoners? 
 
                745 00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,440 
They're gone, she killed them. 
 
746 
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,862 
I underestimated her. 
Have you heard from the casting station? 
 
747 
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,823 
Evergreen's arriving on schedule. 
 
748 
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,702 Let's get going. 
 
749 
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,048 Shit! Tanaseda! 
 
750 
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,602 
[grunts] 
 
751 
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,156 He's not gone yet.

754 
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,306 Oyabun, what happened? 
 
                755 00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,059 
[Tanaseda] I've lived with enough regret. 
 
756 
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,657 
[crowd clamoring] 
 
757 
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,706 Back it up. Sir, step back. 
 
758 
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,459 
Do you know who I am? 
I'm the reason this holiday even exists.

          Apologies, sir, but there's a military freight-- 760 
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,837 I don't give a goddamn. 
 
761 
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,422 
If I'm not the next DHF transfer, 
 
762 
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,133 
I swear I will re-sleeve you in a fucking dog! 
 
763 
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,178 You tell your boys upstairs to have a casting bay ready. 
 
                764 00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,247 [Kovacs] Oyabun! 
 
765 
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,419 
[Tanaseda] 
My honor's intact, unlike yours. 
 
                766 00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,552 
I'm not the person I once was. 
 
767 
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,767 
[Trepp breathes heavily] 
 
768 
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,488 
[panting] 
 
769 
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,120 
[Tanaseda] With what we've done,  none of us should be here. 
 
770

-[rumbling] 
-[grunting] 
 
771 
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,764 
[Tanaseda] 
My honor's intact unlike yours. 772 
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,390 Shit. Kovacs. 
 
773 
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,188 Blood for blood. 
 
774 
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,564 
[screams] 
 
                775 00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:09,775 [Trepp] Wake up! 
 
776 
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,485 
[grunts, panting] 
 
777 
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,362 
[Trepp]  
Kovacs, what the fuck is going on? 
 
778 
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,697 I know what she's doing. 
 
779 
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,992 
She's not killing Meths. 
She's killing Founders. 
 
780 
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,871 
I saw them. 
Axley, Anton, Haruki, Tanaseda. 
 
781 
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,998 -What do you mean? Who's she? -Quell. 
 
                782 00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,543 
-We have to find her. 
-Well, who's left? 
 
783 
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,186 
-[automated voice] System breach. 
-[alarm blaring] 
                784 00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,689 
[automated voice] System breach. 
System breach. 
 
785 
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,401 System breach. System breach. 
 
786 
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,322 System breach. System breach. 
 
787 
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,407 
[beeping] 
 
788 
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,708 What the fuck is going on? 
 
789 
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,503 Our asset. I need status. 
 
790 
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,047 Evergreen was decanted, sir. 
 
791 
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,969 So I see. 
 
                792 00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:33,733 Not sure what you need me for. 
It seems relatively under control. 
 
793 
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,861 Good to see you, son. 
 
794 
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,821 Welcome home.

[hologram buzzes] 
 
12 
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,783 You heard the man. 
 
13 
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,371 I come in peace. 
 
                14 00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,873 
[Poe] All evidence to the contrary. 
 
                15 00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,709 
How the fuck are you still alive? 
 
16 
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,085 Guess I got lucky. 
 
17 
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,797 
       Bullshit. Last we saw,  you were smoldering on the ground. 
 
18 
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,259 
Do not trust this scoundrel. 
He brought these jackboots upon us. 
 
19 
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,261 He attacked Miss Dig. 
 
                20 00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,890 
[Kovacs Prime] You're not easy to find. 
I used the the AI to track you. 
 
                       21 00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,894 -I knew I'd be there to take care of it. -[Kovacs] Were you expecting a thank you? 
 
22 
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,772 
Enough. The Protectorate knows we're here. 
We need to move out. 
 
                23 00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,066 
-All of us. 
-[Kovacs] He's Jaeger's man. 
 
                24 00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,610 
He's safer with a bullet in his head. 
 
25 
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,987 
Is that what I should've done to you on the bridge that day? 
 
26 
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,405 Put a bullet in your head? 
 
27 
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,243 Come on, let's go. 
 
                28 00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,087 
Take TJ to Shira's and wait for me. 
Tell her we need to disappear. 
 
29 
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,172 What about you? 
 
30 
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,173 Hey. 
 
31 
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,175 It's okay. 
 
                32 00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,303 
I'm right behind you, sweetie. 
 
33 
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,763 All right? 
 
34 
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,435 I won't be long. 
 
35 
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:48,978 Don't be. 
 
36 
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,611 
[alarm beeping] 
 
37 
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,529 What the hell's that? 
 
38 
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,242 
No need to panic. It is just the construct appears to be empty. 
 
                 39 00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,786 -You said you had it contained. -We did. 
 
                 40 00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,748 
-That does not sound good. 
-The Elder, it found a way out. 
 
41 
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,292 What do you mean "the Elder"? 
 
42 
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,003 
It was there in VR. 
It's what invaded Quell's stack. 
 
                43 00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,298 
-[Trepp] You gotta be fucking kidding me. 
-Even if that is true, 
 
44 
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,968 the firewall was finished. 
Miss Dig sealed it completely. 
 
                45 00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,886 
Someone must've opened a door. 
 
                46 00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,931 
Jaeger. He was there inside the construct. 
 
47 
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,850 
        We used his signal to find your server in the real. 
 
48 
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,936 We have to track him down. 
 
                49 00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,813 
-And shoot him. 
-[Quell] You can't. 
 
50 
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,731 
It'll just invade the nearest stack. 
 
51 
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,734 
The upgrades on that Wedge sleeve won't give it much time, 
 
                52 00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,695 
-but it could be enough. 
-Enough for what? 
 
                53 00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,156 
Enough to access Angelfire and unleash it. 
 
54 
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,408 
[device beeps] 
 
                55 00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,911 
Protectorate just issued an order. 
Squad's on the way. 
 
                56 00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,830 
-I'm getting it too. 
-We need to go. 
 
57 
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,666 
Where? 
The Nevermore's burned thanks to him. 
 
58 
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,209 We'll go to my dad's. 
 
59 
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,212 
You all can resupply there. 
We'll stick to the alleys. 
 
60 
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,467 You coming? 
 
61 
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,599 Search the Array. 
 
62 
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,145 
Find out who's paying the Renouncers to lie about Konrad Harlan. 
 
                63 00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,355 
We might need him before this is all over. 
 
64 
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,149 How will I find you? 
 
65 
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,192 I'll keep you tethered. 
 
66 
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,371 
[soft buzzing] 
 
67 
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,091 
[Stone] Governor, I'm not sure how much you remember. 
 
68 
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,303 
I installed your latest backup and it's-- [grunts] 
 
69 
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:49,015 
     Oh, I remember. You snuck off like a coward and left me to get shot! 
 
70 
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,726 
       And I'm guessing you let my attackers escape. 
 
71 
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,102 Their Envoy half-blinded me. 
 
72 
 00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,524 I'd advise you save your anger for a more appropriate target. 
 
73 
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,486 
Your colonel came out of VR and went on a rampage. 
 
74 
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,530 
Killed every tech in the barracks, wiped their backups too. 
 
75 
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:09,619 
He also cleaned out an entire store of sleeve reacclimation drugs. 
 
76 
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,745 
[sighs] 
 
77 
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,872 Where is he now? 
 
78 
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,756 
[glass shatters]

[whirring] 
 
                81 00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,578 
[Semetaire] Tsk, tsk, Colonel. 
 
82 
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,248 Stealing is against the law. 
 
83 
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,916 Even for you. 
 
84 
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,085 You want to talk... 
 
85 
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,339 about justice? 
 
86 
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,093 Your kind... 
 
87 
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,680 descended like vultures... 
 
88 
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,016 
-[grunts] 
-...to pick our bones. 
 
89 
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,064 
[groans, screams] 
 
90 
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,158 
[indistinct chatter] 
 
91 
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,037 
        [Kovacs] I thought we were sticking to the alleys. 
 
                92 00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,497 
[Quell] Is there no other way? 
 
93 
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,460 
Stay here. 
I'll do some recon, make sure it's safe. 
 
94 
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:41,878 I'll go with you. 
 
95 
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,090 -Quell-- -Don't. 
 
                96 00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,009 
Letting the Elder out was too big a risk. 
 
97 
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,386 
            I made a call and I'll do it again to save you. 
 
98 
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,929 That's what I'm afraid of. 
 
99 
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,016 
It isn't the first time your feelings for me have led to a body count. 
 
100 
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,685 This is about Stronghold. 
 
101 
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,606 
If I hadn't stumbled upon your camp, Rei would have never betrayed us. 
 
102 
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,358 
It's both of us. 
We are the problem. 
 
103 
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,196 What are you saying? 
 
                104 00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,866 
Getting close to you was my mistake. 
 
105 
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,951 I won't make it again. 
 
                106 00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,831 
Let's go. Just keep your heads down. 
 
107 
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,475 This is it. 
 
                108 00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,688 
-It's no good. The patrols. 
-[Trepp] Relax, it'll just be a minute. 
 
109 
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,856 
[keypad beeps] 
 
                110 00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,568 
-It's not locked. 
-[Quell] They've been here already. 
 
                111 00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,195 
Like I said, we should keep going. 
 
112 
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:55,952 Dad? 
 
                113 00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,747 [frantic] No! 
 
                114 00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,499 [shouts] Dad! 
 
115 
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,918 Dad. 
 
                116 00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,921 
It's okay, we can spin him back up. 
 
117 
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,549 His stack... 
 
                118 00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,009 
-they ripped it. 
-We'll find it. 
 
119 
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,053 It has to be here. 
 
120 
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,853 You tracked us to Stronghold. 
 
121 
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,274 -You stopped here on the way. 
-[Quell] Trepp. 
 
                122 00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,281 [whimpering] No. 
 
                123 00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,909 [crying] No. 
 
124 
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,331 
[sobbing] 
 
125 
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,003 
You were sloppy. 
You scrubbed the AI but left the metadata. 
 
                126 00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,881 
You're not used to it, are you? 
Dealing with consequences. 
 
127 
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,677 
           Sir, I hacked the Renouncers' credit holdings. 
 
128 
     00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,888 Concealed behind several false fronts  is a name I suspect you already know. 
 
129 
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,848 Danica... 
 
                130 00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,602 
-Oh, no. 
-[Kovacs] Poe! 
 
131 
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,395 Later. 
 
132 
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,231 
My father told me to stay the hell away from all of you. 
 
                133 00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,442 
Wasn't this your Protectorate friends? Hmm? 
 
                134 00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,819 
Did you know what they did to him? 
 
135 
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,240 All of you get out. 
 
136 
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,908 
Now! 
 
137 
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,577 
[Quell] You're right to be angry, 
 
138 
  00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,288 but you saw that fire come down. 
Jaeger is out here. 
 
139 
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,665 
           Let him torch the whole [shouts] goddamn city! 
 
                    140 00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,418 I don't give a fuck about your cause! 
 
141 
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,880 
I was in this for my brother and he is gone. [crying]  
 
                142 00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,759 
My father's stack is in pieces. 
 
143 
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,178 Our business here is done. 
 
144 
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,308 Leave. 
 
                145 00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,686 [shouts] Leave! 
 
146 
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,068 
[sobbing] 
 
147 
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,321 
[door closes] 
 
                148 00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,870 
-What now? 
-[Quell] We find Jaeger. 
 
149 
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,747 
It won't work. You said yourself, 
 
150 
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,832 the Elder will just invade the nearest stack. 
 
                  151 00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,002 -[Kovacs Prime] You got a better idea? 
-We give it what it wants. 
 
                  152 00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,129 
Keep up your end of the bargain. 
 
153 
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:16,717 
  Danica Harlan's been paying Renouncers to say Konrad's one of them, but he's not. 
 
                154 00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,552 
Which means she knows where he is. 
 
                155 00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,805 
-You wanna confront her? 
-[Kovacs] I'm done running. 
 
156 
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:25,309 
The sky is literally about to fall, and I've got nothing left to lose. 
 
                157 00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,730 
All right, Tak. What's your play? 
 
158 
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,983 We go in the front door. 
 
159 
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,669 
[guard] Fugitives approaching. 
Clear the way. 
 
                160 00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,718 [Danica] Takeshi Kovacs. 
 
161 
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,095 Both of you this time. 
 
162 
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,934 I believe I owe you a bullet. 
 
                163 00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,103 
That's a bad way to start a negotiation. 
 
                164 00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,564 
Your message said this was surrender. 
 
165 
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,025 
The only reason you agreed to our terms is because you know the truth. 
 
166 
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,777 Your world is in danger. 
 
167 
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,655 Quellcrist Falconer. 
 
                     168 00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:25,745 I see you've taken up your old mantle. 
Don't you know The Uprising isn't real? 
 
169 
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,079 It is now. 
 
                170 00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,545 
My father's stories don't do you justice. 
 
171 
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:38,215 
              Then again, he always did underestimate women. 
 
172 
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,509 Not me. 
 
173 
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,304 
I've seen what you can do. 
 
174 
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,307 
The only ones who can control the Orbitals are the ones who built them. 
 
                175 00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,392 
-Elders are extinct. 
-[Kovacs Prime] Not quite. 
 
176 
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,561 Ask your colonel. 
 
                177 00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,813 
Not acting like himself, is he? 
 
                178 00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,358 
What do you know about Carrera? 
 
                179 00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,279 
It's not him you need to worry about. 
It's the Elder stuck in his stack. 
 
                180 00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,365 
He wants revenge for what your father did. 
 
                181 00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,201 
And it will use Carrera to get it. 
 
182 
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,995 
Do you hear yourselves? 
You've lost your minds. 
 
183 
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,248 
Maybe. But to save Harlan's World, we need Konrad. 
 
                 184 00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,002 -My father's with the Renouncers. 
-[Kovacs] That's a lie! 
 
                 185 00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,963 
Everything on these walls is a lie. 
 
186 
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,967 
    When that Colony ship touched down, there were Elders here and he killed them! 
 
187 
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,928 
What you're talking about is ancient history. 
 
188 
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:28,182 
When Konrad opened fire, the Songspire copied the consciousness of an Elder, 
 
189 
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,266 stored it. 
 
                190 00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,811 
-That's ridiculous. 
-[Kovacs Prime] Is it? 
 
                191 00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,021 
We don't know how Elder technology works. 
 
192 
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,232 
         The Founders must answer for their crime 
 
193 
     00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,235 or that forest won't be the only thing that burns. 
 
                194 00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,862 
And how could you possibly know that? 
 
195 
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,699 Because before the Elder was in Carrera's stack... 
 
196 
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,328 it was in mine. 
 
197 
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,289 
[sighs] 
 
198 
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,844 
The noble heroes want to feed my father to the monster. 
 
199 
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,726 Go ahead, he's yours. 
 
200 
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,355 There's nothing left. 
 
                201 00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,526 
-His backups. 
-You're a woman of vision, Miss Falconer. 
 
                202 00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,736 
You understand the lengths one must go to. 
 
203 
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:23,988 It was coup. 
 
204 
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,074 
My father was too afraid of the Protectorate. 
 
205 
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:30,411 
He gave in to their insatiable demand for alloy. 
 
206 
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,247 
And at the rate he was going, he'd have nothing left. 
 
207 
   00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,792 You manufactured a war in my name. 
 
208 
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,586 You said make it personal. 
 
209 
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,712 I did. 
 
210 
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,757 
     I sacrificed family, stood up to the Protectorate. 
 
211 
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,759 You should be proud. 
 
212 
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,764 I do miss him now and then, that's why I keep him close. 
 
                213 00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,060 
Maybe I'll put your stacks next to his. Guards! 
 
214 
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,359 
You want Angelfire to overthrow the Protectorate? It's yours. 
 
215 
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,320 How? 
 
216 
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,448 
The Elder almost destroyed us both when it fired the Orbitals. 
 
                217 00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,700 
But it learns from experience. 
 
218 
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:14,455 
       It knows now that it needs something external to give it a boost. 
 
219 
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:20,002 
It will fuse its technology with ours to control the Orbitals 
 
220 
     00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,255 without destroying the sleeve it's in. 
 
221 
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,844 
With that device in your hand... 
 
222 
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,474 you control Angelfire. 
 
223 
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,726 Thanks for the tip. 
 
224 
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,563 
But I don't need you to kill Carrera and take it. 
 
                225 00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,441 
Killing it is not the solution. 
It's a ghost. 
 
                226 00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,902 
Anger is what holds it together. 
 
227 
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,613 
We offer it Konrad's stack, 
 
228 
       00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,742 let it see that its vengeance is complete so it can rest. 
 
                229 00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,787 
And what do you get in return? 
 
230 
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,789 Safe transport off planet. 
 
231 
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,584 
You're not the only one that wants  to bring the Protectorate down. 
 
232 
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,754 We're on the same side. 
 
233 
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,637 This is clearly a bad time. 234 00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,806 
-The Orbitals? 
-What about them? 
 
235 
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,892 They are moving. 
 
236 
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,365 
People of Millsport, 
 
237 
    00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,243 a mandatory curfew is now in effect. 
 
238 
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:38,914 
 All citizens should immediately seek shelter and remain indoors. 
 
239 
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,249 
[crowd clamoring] 
 
240 
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,961 
     I repeat, all citizens should immediately seek shelter 
 
241 
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,046 and remain indoors. 
 
                242 00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,427 
Why waste time moving the Orbitals? 
One would do plenty of damage. 
 
243 
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,096 
The Elder doesn't wanna do damage, it wants mass destruction. 
 
244 
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,724 Wherever they come together, Jaeger will be there. 
 
245 
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,101 
 Poe, try and figure out the point of convergence. 246 
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,978 
I should have the deduction for you shortly. 
 
247 
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,106 
What you said back there, 
 
248 
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,483 I get the whole 
"keep your enemy close" thing, 
 
249 
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,986 -but giving her Angelfire-- -It won't come to that. 
 
250 
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,320 How do you know? 
 
251 
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,282 
What if Konrad's fragged stack doesn't satisfy it? 
 
                  252 00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,452 -What if we can't even get close? 
-Why don't you for once trust her plan? 
 
253 
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,037 Because she taught me better. 
 
254 
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,080 Someone has to ask questions. 
 
255 
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,833 What's your alternative, Tak? 
Because I don't see one. 
 
256 
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,377 Trepp. 
 
257 
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,672 
In the forest, 
her coils connected with the Orbital. 
 
258 
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,259 
   Maybe she could disrupt the signal, buy us some time to get close to Jaeger. 
 
                 259 00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,470 
Well, that's great, but Trepp's not here. 
 
                 260 00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:38,766 -Go. See if you can convince her. 
-[Kovacs] She's more likely to shoot him. 
 
261 
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,810 I'll do it. 
 
                262 00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,899 
So what, you a good soldier now? 
 
263 
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,818 
     You might be willing to walk through fire for her, 
 
264 
  00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,488 but if you wanna prove yourself, you'll follow my lead. 
 
265 
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,907 
You think because you lived longer that makes you wise? 
 
266 
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,617 You've never watched her die. 
 
267 
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,789 
          Send me the coordinates when you have them. I'll meet you there. 
 
268 
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,465 
I did my part. 
The people of Millsport are tucked away. 
 
269 
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,674 What about yours? 
 
270 
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,802 Poe, the Orbitals? 
 
271 
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,220 
[laughs] 
 
272 
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,473 
[ticking] 
 
                273 00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,976 
I'm sorry. What was the question? 
 
274 
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,522 
   You were calculating the point of convergence. 
 
275 
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,689 The Orbitals. 
 
276 
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,274 
I--  
277 
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,776 Is this normal? 
 
278 
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,986 No. Well, kinda. 
 
279 
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,321 Poe! 
 
280 
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,366 
Sorry, I just seem to have lost my train of-- 
 
281 
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,035 
[glitching] 
 
282 
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,913 
[chuckles] 
 
283 
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,252 Excuse me. 
 
284 
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,633 Stone, try and be useful. 
 
285 
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,892 
[distant indistinct automated voice] 
 
                286 00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,275 [whispering] Miss Dig. 
 
                287 00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,321 
You believed my mind could be healed. 
 
288 
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,036 Now I need your faith. 
 
                289 00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,875 [Lizzie] Hello, Eddie. 
 
290 
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,465 Miss Elizabeth. 
 
291 
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:40,596 Or is this another delusion? 
 
292 
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,389 I'm not really her. 
 
293 
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,476 
I'm a program designed to extract and preserve data. 
 
294 
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,396 
         Dig 301 thought  you might need a friendly face 
 
295 
    00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,273 when you arrived at this precipice. 
 
296 
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,691 
[exhales] 
 
297 
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,028 Please... 
 
298 
    00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,240 it's my glitch, it's overtaking me. 
 
299 
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,622 
If you would just hold me together long enough to keep them alive, 
 
300 
  00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,835 and then you may do with my mind what you will. 
 
                301 00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,254 [Lizzie] Is that a command? 
 
302 
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,385 Very well. 
 
303 
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,856 The damage is extensive. 
 
304 
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,025 A real challenge. 
 
                305 00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,694 
I'll need to reconfigure the algorithms. 
 
                306 00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,989 
-How long will that take? 
-It's not easy, Poe. 
 
307 
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,408 I have to wipe everything. 308 00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,662 
It's going to feel like dying. 
 
                309 00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,374 
I'll let you know when it's time. 
 
310 
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,752 Miss Elizabeth... 
 
311 
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,887 please come back. 
 
312 
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,641 It's no use. 
 
                313 00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,935 
[Kovacs] There you are. 
I've been looking for you. 
 
314 
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,604 If you're gonna brood... 
 
315 
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,943 you may as well drink. 
 
316 
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,113 Sir... 
 
317 
 00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,575 -if you're going to chastise-- 
-It's too late for that, isn't it? 
 
318 
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,662 You... 
 
319 
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,706 are shutting down. 
 
320 
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,209 Yes. 
 
321 
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,504 
All these years, 
 
322 
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:42,426 
     I've clung to memories even when they've brought pain, 
 
                323 00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,845 peril upon myself and others. 
 
324 
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,887 Been there. 
 
325 
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:51,893 
    And despite my best efforts, everything is still slipping away. 
 
326 
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,353 I've done that. 
 
                327 00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,357 [Poe] Time. 
 
                328 00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,740 
Time is what's thwarted me, hmm. 
 
329 
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,455 I am going to die. 
 
330 
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,417 
Just broken... [chuckles] 
 
331 
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,506 and of no use to anyone. 
 
332 
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,010 Well, congratulations. 
 
333 
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,930 You've finally figured out what it means to be alive. 334 
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,601 We're all broken, Poe. 
 
                335 00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,897 
There's nothing more human than that. 
 
336 
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,317 Oh.  
337 
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,239 Miss Falconer. 
 
338 
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,240 
[sighs] 
 
                339 00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:51,119 
Your journey brought you to Miss Falconer. 
 
340 
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,955 You found each other. 
 
341 
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,335 And see what good that did. 
 
342 
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,421 I wanted us... 
 
343 
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,841 to have a life. 
 
344 
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,345 But it looks like... 
 
345 
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,764 
[scoffs] 
 
346 
       00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,142 it's just me, you, and misery. [chuckles] 
 
347 
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,365 
        Your second chance may not be what you envisioned. 
 
348 
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,744 
But if you're too stubborn to accept it, then you are right. 
 
349 
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,081 You do not deserve it. 
 
350 
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,632 -[Kovacs] What are you doing? 
-Tracking Orbitals. 
 
351 
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,136 
I will not squander what little time I have left. 
 
352 
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,519 
And as your friend, 
 
353 
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,688 I entreat you... 
 
354 
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,941 to not squander yours. 
 
355 
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,741 
[rumbling] 
 
356 
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,126 
[distant indistinct automated voice] 
 
                357 00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,768 [Kovacs] You were right. 
 
358 
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,606 
I'm shortsighted when it comes to you, but you... 
 
359 
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,900 
you see it all. 
 
360 
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,160 
I can't change what I've done, 
 
361 
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,078 but I'm here, 
 
362 
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,081 whatever way you need. 
 
                363 00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,751 
Even if you can't say the same. 
 
364 
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,885 
I've trained myself to see every detail and somehow... 
 
365 
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,223 I never see you coming. 
 
366 
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,479 You're a crack in my armor,  one I can't afford, but... 
 
367 
     00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:30,278 when I was buried so deep in my stack, 
I didn't even know who I was, 
 
368 
      00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,989 you gave me the strength to break free. 
 
369 
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,034 Tak... 
 
370 
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,544 
I risked the Settled Worlds to touch you again. 
 
371 
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,299 I've seen that look before. 372 
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,512 
That last night at the lake, 
 
373 
  00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,181 when you told me your real name. 
 
374 
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,892 Nadia Makita. 
 
375 
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,607 
        Only reason you told me was because you weren't coming back. 
 
                376 00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,487 
You're doing it again, aren't you? 
 
377 
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,158 I trained you too well. 
 
378 
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,540 So what's the real plan? 
 
379 
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,542 
If I have to, 
 
380 
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,627 
I kill Jaeger, 
 
                381 00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,713 force the Elder back into me. 
 
382 
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,507 
And when our minds are intertwined, 
 
383 
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,176 
I can control the Orbital like I did before. 
 
                384 00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,220 
-And then what? 
-And then... 
 
                385 00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,806 
I bring the fire back on the Elder. 
 
386 
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,641 And myself. 
 
                387 00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,770 
-No! 
-This is why I waited to tell you. 
 
388 
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,315 
Why is your solution always fix it and die? 
 
389 
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,318 
  Life has to have limits or we're not human anymore. 
 
390 
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,863 
I created stacks. 
If someone has to pay for the wrong 
 
391 
    00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,157 done to the Elders, it should be me. 
 
                392 00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,368 
You just wanted to see the stars. 
 
393 
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,079 
We are more than the sum of our intentions. 
 
394 
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,998 I have to make it right. 
 
395 
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,376 Tak... 
 
396 
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,588 I do love you. 
 
                397 00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,928 
I wish you loved me enough to live. 
 
                398 00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,189 
[Kovacs Prime] I need to see Trepp. 
 
399 
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,566 
I don't know who the fuck you're talking about. 
 
400 
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,946 It's okay, Shira. 
 
401 
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,533 Give me a minute. 
 
                402 00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,327 
Tell Myka and TJ I'll be right there. 
 
403 
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,040 
[door opens] 
 
404 
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,543 
[door closes] 
 
                405 00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:35,130 
You just couldn't leave well enough alone? 
I told you, I'm out. 
 
406 
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,173 
That was before the Orbitals started moving. 
 
407 
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,968 No one will survive this,  not you, not your family. 
 
408 
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,554 
Then I will spend my last moments  with them! 
 
409 
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,056 
You locked onto the signal. 
You could find a way to jam it. 
 
410 
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,394 
     You think my coils are a match for an Orbital? 
 
                411 00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,565 It's like a drop in the ocean. 
Nothing I do will make a difference. 
 
                412 00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,403 
It's not what your father believed. 
 
                413 00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,824 
He traded his life for your future. 
 
                414 00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,786 
He was brave until his last moment. 
 
415 
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,788 He never gave you up. 
 
416 
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,169 
        I should blast you in your goddamn stack right now. 
 
                       417 00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,798 Quell knew if I came here, you'd kill me. 
 
418 
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,633 She sent me anyway. 
 
419 
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,429 Go ahead. 
 
420 
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,306 I won't fight. 
 
421 
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,852 
But I believe you have a difference 
to make. We all do. 
 
422 
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,196 Huzzah! 
 
423 
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,867 
   From the ashes of defeat rises the phoenix of victory. 
 
424 
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,076 Mr. Kovacs! 
 
                425 00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,370 
-What did you find? 
-[Poe] Pardon me, boyo.  
 
426 
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,663 Ah!  
427 
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,416 
My calculations suggest 
 
428 
   00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,211 the Orbitals should converge here. 
 
429 
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,423 
The needlecast station. 
We've gotta get there. 
 
430

[rumbling] 
 
431 
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,438 You gift wrapped Dad, huh? 
 
432 
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,732 Presentation is everything. 
 
433 
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,151 They're communicating. 
 
434 
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,492 
Just so we're clear, if we survive this, 
 
435 
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,202 I will kill you. 
 
                436 00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,162 [scoffs] Does it matter? 
 
437 
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:32,997 Over there. 
 
                  438 00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,878 -About time you joined the party. 
-I'm grateful you came. 
 
439 
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,507 
Well, I've got places I'd rather be, so let's get this over with. 
 
                440 00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,468 
Stay here. Seal off the building. 
 
441 
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,053 What about you? 
 
442 
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,473 
We'll take the Governor up. 
I'm hoping you can give us an opening. 
 
443 
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,308 I'll certainly try. 
 
444 
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,144 Let's go. 
 
445 
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:02,443 
No guards, no weapons. 
We need to earn the Elder's trust. 
 
446 
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,282 
Stone, make sure my soldiers 
man the perimeter. 
 
                447 00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,575 
You're going in without backup? 
 
448 
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,202 
I'm with the leader of The Uprising and the Last Envoy. 
 
449 
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,621 I have all the backup I need.

451 
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,756 I got a signal.

457 
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,498 I kept my end of the bargain. 
 
                458 00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:03,254 
We brought you the last Founder. 
No one else has to suffer. 
 
459 
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,217 It's too late. 
 
460 
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,640 You are all thieves. 
 
461 
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,309 You stole our world. 
 
462 
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,187 But you left the gate open. 
 
                463 00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,399 
You can't hold back the inevitable.

                468 00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,335 
We're nothing compared to you.

00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:43,962 What are you doing?

00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,215

This is what's left of the man who killed your species. 
 
480 
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,288 He's yours. 
 
481 
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,583 Take what is offered.

But there remains some confusion.

00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,670 You claim Quellcrist Falconer was incinerated by Angelfire,

  00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,404 once the Protectorate Ambassador arrives on planet. 
 
                578 00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,197 
Needlecasting resumes tomorrow. 
 
579 
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,368 
          [Dig] Second chances are earned in the choices we make... 
 
                580 00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,459 
Wow, you can't even see the damage. 
 
581 
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,045 Learned from the best. 
 
                582 00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,631 
-[woman] Thank you. 
-You got it. 
 
                583 00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,759 
[Dig] ...in what we choose to forget... 
 
584 
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,929 and in what we forgive. 
 
                585 00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,309 
-Hey. 
-Hey. 
 
586 
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,313 
  Moms, Nevin and Lash are going to the salvage yard. Can I go too? 
 
587 
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,648 I'll be careful. 
 
588 
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,151 You better be. 
 
                589 00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,194 
That sleeve is finally paid for. 
 
590 
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,946 -If you break it-- -I won't. 
 
591 
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,079 
[Dig] With each choice we make, 
 
592 
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,999 we are led somewhere new. 
 
593 
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,462 
[device beeps] 
 
594 
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,423 Good news? 
 
                595 00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,760 
They're recommending I stay on planet. 
 
596 
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,387 They want me to support the interim government. 
 
                597 00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,265 
The Protectorate still needs to sign off. 
 
598 
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,683 Make sure they do. 
 
599 
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,727 We need your intel. 
 
                600 00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,229 
Team's on the way to retrieve your sleeve. 601 
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,482 We'll keep it safe. 
 
602 
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,908 
I'd tell you to call when you get where you're going, 
 
603 
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,827 but I have a feeling 
you don't want me to know. 
 
                604 00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,622 
[Quell] It's safer if you don't. 
 
605 
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,713 This isn't a goodbye. 
 
606 
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,427 
[Dig] But with every step I take, 
 
607 
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,930 your memory haunts. 
 
                 608 00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,945

                 609 00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,239 Please enter your transfer code. 
 
610 
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,534 [Kovacs] Still chasing death? 
 
611 
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,915 
Without death we can't know what a life is worth. 
 
                612 00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:15,045 
-So where to now? 
-[Quell] The Uprising here has dried up. 
 
613 
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,297 So I'll find a new world. 
 
614 
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,426 
With the right conditions, it'll grow again. 
 
615 
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,471 But you know that already. 
 
616 
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,808 You're in my mind. 
 
                 617 00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,400 It would be easier to join you. 
 
618 
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:37,943 You won't. 
 
619 
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,028 Not yet. 
 
620 
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,950 I'm gonna fix it... 
 
621 
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,286 and live. 
 
622 
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,669 
[whispers] There's nowhere you can go that I won't be with you. 
 
623 
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,385 
[automated voice] Please step inside and prepare for departure. 
 
                624 00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,557 
[Dig] I never used to dream... 
 
625 
  00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,186 but now, when I close my eyes... 626 
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:15,981 I see you. 
 
627 
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,501 
          It's been months since I woke up to find you gone. 
 
628 
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,588 
Our time together clings to me 
 
629 
  00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,965 like those stories in your book. 
 
630 
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,804 It's up to me to preserve it. 
 
631 
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,564 Poe! 
 
632 
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,441 
[exhales deeply] 
 
                633 00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,777 
Hmm. I'm sorry, do I know you? 
 
634 
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,947 My program, didn't it work? 
 
635 
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,325 I must've made a mistake. 
 
636 
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,661 You're starting from scratch. 
 
637 
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,163 What is this place? 
 
638 
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,957 The Nevermore. 
 
639 
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,751 
A sanctuary for the weary traveler. 
 
640 
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,753 Like you, Poe. 
 
                641 00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,841 
-Poe? 
-You named yourself after the author. 
 
642 
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,511 Oh.  
643 
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:28,929 Hmm. 
 
644 
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,975 
   At first I didn't see what you saw in this book. 
 
645 
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,477 
It's dark and very strange, but then again, 
 
646 
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,229 so is the world. 
 
647 
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,983 I also took a new name from one of the poems. 
 
648 
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,779 "Many and many a year ago in a kingdom by the sea, 
 
649 
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:50,117 this maiden, she lived 
with  no other thought than to love..." 
 
650 
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,661 
"And be loved by me." 
 
651 
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,331 Would that make you Annabel? 
 
                652 00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,792 
Much more unique, don't you think? 
 
653 
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,794 It's a very good moniker. 
 
654 
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,298 Yes! A moniker. 
 
655 
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,843 
[sighs] 
You'll get it all back, you'll see. 
 
                656 00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,345 
You just need some inspiration. 
 
657 
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,055 I'll help you. 
 
658 
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,473 I'd like that. 
 
659 
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,144 Where have you been? 
 
660 
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,732 
I searched the Array. 
There wasn't a trace. 
 
661 
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,985 
According to my internal logs, 
I've been decompressing for three months, 
 
662 
    00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,529 ten days, 12 hours, and 55 seconds. 
 
663 
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:31,074 
It seems I've been entangled in quite a bit of... 
 
664 
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,745 fragmented data that needed to be whole. 
 
665 
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:39,249 
The only clue I have was this address and this bit of code. 
 
666 
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,210 Huh. A decryption key. 
 
667 
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,088 Let me enter it. 
 
668 
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,554 Poe, this isn't just code. 
 
669 
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,307 
You're storing a raw human DHF. 
 
670 
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,685 
-What? But why? 
-There's only one way to find out. 
 
671 
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,688 Download the data. 
 
672 
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,749 What do you suppose it is? 
 
673 
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,797 
Better get the good whiskey ready.

[Kovacs] This is a ghost story.

Told in the age of eternal life.

00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,009 
Hmm. Perhaps an organic sleeve would be more to your liking? 
 
                37 00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,346 
Uh-uh. I'm traveling. Interstellar.

  May I ask what brings you all the way to Maghda Prime? 
 
39 
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,770 
I'm looking for someone.

00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,481 Takeshi Kovacs?

00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,857 I beg your pardon. 
 
42 
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,945 
  Word is he's owed a lot of credits and he'll be here tonight to collect. 
 
                43 00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,864 
Any idea which one of these losers is him? 
 
44 
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,662 
Hmm. I wish I could be of service, 
 
45 
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,749 but I hear Takeshi Kovacs 
is off on an epic quest 
 
46 
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,043 
to find his long-lost love, Quellcrist Falconer. 
 
47 
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,046 
[chuckles] 
 
48 
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,551 
    Oh, sounds like a load of swamp-panther crap to me. 
 
49 
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,469 I assure you, it is not. 
 
50 
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:08,975 
You expect me to buy that Takeshi Kovacs, the Last Envoy, and Quellcrist Falconer, 
 
51 
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,102 leader of the Uprising, 
 
52 
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,980 had a thing? 
 
53 
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,275 
If you mean a passionate connection transcending time 
 
54 
 00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,862 and challenging the grim bounds of death itself, 
 
55 
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,198 then yes, they had a thing. 
 
56 
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,411 I never heard that. 
 
                57 00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,081

00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,846 I can deliver her. 
 
                217 00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,765 
How? How do you know it's really her? 
 
218 
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,475 Do you have her DHF? 
 
219 
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,394 Is she spun up, re-sleeved? 
 
                220 00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,020 
[shouts] Where the fuck did you find her? 
 
221 
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,314 
I'll answer all your questions when you're here. 
 
222 
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,608 As long as you keep me alive. 
 
223 
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,611 Falconer's life for mine. 
 
224 
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,613 Do I have your word? 
 
225 
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,868 
If you're lying, 
 
226 
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,496 you have my word 
the last thing you'll see is this face 
 
227 
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,708 before your stack is ripped from your spine. 
 
228 
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:43,382 
I crossed the stars in a colony ship before stacks were invented. 
 
229 
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,844 
I left a dying Earth behind to seed a new world. 
 
                230 00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,722 
You don't scare me, Mr. Kovacs. 
 
231 
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,309 I know what you dream of. 
 
232 
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,902 Make sure there's a mirror. 
 
233 
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:09,325 
And get your psychopath bounty hunter to transmit my AI. 
 
234 
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,952 Already done. 
 
235 
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,508 
[Kovacs] Stay alive long enough, 
 
236 
 00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,930 and there's nowhere you can go that isn't haunted. 
 
237 
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,141 
       [woman whispering] I see the boy inside the man. 
 
                238 00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,605 
[Kovacs] All of us have ghosts. 
 
                239 00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,904 
They cling to us like shadows. 
 
                240 00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,993 
But if you chase after shadows... 
 
241 
    00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,332 if you're foolish enough to seek out your ghosts... 
 
                242 00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,167 
[Quell] Survive. That's an order! 
 
                243 00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,086 
[Kovacs] ...you just might become one. 
 
244 
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,462 Tak. 
 
245 
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,471

248 
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,995 
[female voice] Thank you for choosing 
Psychosec in-home resleeving package, 
 
                249 00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,372

                250 00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,547 [gags] Mirror. 
 
251 
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:51,427 
[female voice] My readings show that you may be feeling some sleeve sickness. 
 
252 
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,514 
I've alerted support staff. 
Medication is on the way.

[panting] 
 
254 
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,440

I recommend you lie down and relax. 
 
255 
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,859 Your oxygen levels are low.

259 
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,586 Ah.

00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,548

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,801 
[breathes heavily] 
 
262

[panting heavily] 
 
266 
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,984 
[female voice] 
Your resleeving is now complete. 
 
267 
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,861 
[breathing heavily] 
 
268 
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,045 Axley. 
 
269 
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,923 Shit, Axley. 
 
270 
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,092 Wake up. Axley, where is she? 
 
271 
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,052 Gone. 
 
272 
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,011 Tell me! 
 
273 
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:19,848 Axley. 
 
274 
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,090 Fuck. 
 
275 
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,478 You seeing this? 
 
276 
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,940 
"'Twas noontide of summer 
 
277 
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:14,444 
And mid-time of night, 
And stars in their orbits 
 
278 
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:18,073 
Shone pale thro' the night." 
 
279 
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,618 Yeah, but those aren't stars. 
 
280 
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,040 Angelfire. 
 
281 
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,377 Obviously we're on... 
 
282 
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,590 Harlan's World? 
 
283 
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,676 
       You know another planet with a sky full of Elder Orbitals? 
 
                 284 00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,181 
Home again, home again. Huzzah. 
 
                 285 00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,852 -How long has it been? Five years? -Try 30. 
 
286 
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,355 
Of all the godforsaken rocks we've been to, 
 
287 
   00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,399 we're right back where we started. 
 
                288 00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,360 
I thought you swore you'd never return. 
What compelled you? 
 
289 
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,404 Horace Axley compelled me. 
 
                290 00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,532 
And who, pray tell, is Horace Axley? 291 
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,826 He's that one. 
 
292 
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,830 My word. 
 
                293 00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,459 
-We just got here. 
-I didn't kill him. 
 
                294 00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,586 
What a refreshing change. Hmm. 
 
295 
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,590 Is it prudent to loiter? 
 
                296 00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,593 
We're in a house with a murdered Meth. 
Whatever happened, I'll be blamed. 
 
297 
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,263 
     Now Axley said this sleeve has a personalized weapons augment. 
 
                298 00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,308 
-Just have to be within range. 
-[clicks] 
 
299 
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,560 
[whizzing] 
 
300 
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,688 Oh, my. 
 
301 
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,607 Let's go. 
 
302 
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,970 
-[automated female voice] 
-[indistinct chatter]  303 
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,687 Look, the needlecast station. 
It's a sign. We should heed it. 
 
                304 00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,815 
Not until I find out who killed Axley. 
 
305 
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,985 
     We have no idea what Mr. Axley  will remember after he spins back up. 
 
306 
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,487 
And as you said, so astutely, 
 
307 
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,991 accusations for his murder 
could land squarely on you. 
 
308 
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,325 
If we are apprehended, 
 
309 
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,620 you will be arrested, 
and I will be deleted. 
 
310 
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,497 
-Choosing to stay here is... 
-It's not a choice. 
 
                311 00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,832 ...self-destructive. 
 
                312 00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,293 
-Suicide! 
-I'm not leaving. 
 
                313 00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,920 
You don't get it. Axley was a Meth. 
 
314 
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,172 
He should have been untouchable with his resources, 
 
315 
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,799 but he was scared shitless. 
 
                316 00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,635 
He believed he needed protection. 
And he was right. 
 
317 
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,512 If he was right about that... 
 
318 
 00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,807 he might be right about Quell. 
 
319 
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,769 Quell? 
 
320 
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,938 He said she's here. 
 
                321 00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,899 
He swore to prove it if I kept him alive. 
 
                322 00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,194 
[Poe] I see. If that is the case... 
 
323 
 00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,281 we'll need some place to stay. 
 
324 
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,117 I know a place. 
 
325 
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,412 
An old AI hotel a friend of mine used to own. 
 
326 
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,166 
[female newscaster] There has also been a decrease in terrorist activity 
 
327 
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,168 
within the city of Millsport itself. 
 
328 
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,588 
Negotiations with Joshua Kemp are ongoing 
 
                329 00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,631 
-as we await... 
-Check the local feed. 
 
                330 00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,467 
Axley said something about a war. 
 
331 
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,595 
It appears we've arrived in the middle of it. 
 
332 
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,017 
              [Renouncer holo] True salvation is found in renunciation. 
 
333 
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,188 
Become a Renouncer and the world can be  as you make it. No loss, no pain. 
 
334 
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,147 No, thank you. 
 
335 
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,361 
[overlapping automated voices] 
 
336 
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,952 
  Do a search on Konrad Harlan, see what the old bastard's up to. 
 
337 
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,955 
[female newscaster] Attention, stand by for an important message 
 
338 
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,290 from Governor Harlan. 
 
339 
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,167 
That's not Konrad. 
 
340 
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,254 
According to the Array, 
Konrad recently abdicated his position, 
 
341 
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,715 along with everything else. 
 
342 
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,716 You're kidding? 
 
343 
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,054 
In his absence, his daughter, Danica, has taken up his mantle. 
 
                344 00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,848 
Let me guess. She ran unopposed. 
 
345 
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,350 That is also accurate. 
 
346 
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,064 
Citizens of Harlan's World, 
 
347 
    00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,693 for 20 years the Quellist rebellion 
has disrupted our way of life. 
 
348 
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,904 
Mines have been sabotaged, 
 
349 
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,699 alloy shipments attacked, 
our people dislocated. 
 
350 
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,911 
At every step, we have fought back against these terrorists, 
 
351 
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,290 weakening them, 
rooting them out of our cities. 
 
                352 00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,253 
But we have also suffered great loss. 
 
353 
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,630 
It's with this shared burden in mind 
 
354 
      00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:48,218 that I have recently entered into talks 
with Quellist leader Joshua Kemp. 
 
355 
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,554 
[crowd booing] 
 
356 
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,808 
It would seem the revolution has a new face as well. 
 
357 
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,269 I've seen enough. 
 
358 
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,105 
[Danica] After much negotiation, 
 
359 
     00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:04,276 we have agreed this conflict must end. 
 
360 
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,196 
A cease-fire is now in place effective immediately. 
 
361 
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,282 
[crowd cheers] 
 
362 
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,286 
   [Danica] Starting tomorrow,  mining operations resume in full. 
 
363 
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:20,292 
    Make no mistake, if the cease-fire  is broken, our retaliation will be swift. 364 
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,962 
But tonight, as your governor 
 
365 
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,423 and as my father's daughter, 
 
366 
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:31,678 
  I am proud to declare the safety of Harlan's World has been secured. 
 
367 
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,474 Thank you. Good night. 
 
368 
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,061 
[sighs] 
 
369 
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,774 Congratulations. 
 
                370 00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,776 
You've brought peace to the world.

My father used to say that a cease-fire was just a breath between battles.

                377 00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,842 
Colonel Carrera has every reason to stay. 
 
378 
  00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:15,889 The only thing standing between  the Protectorate and us is them.

Well, I think you're giving them too much credit.

Anyone who builds weaponized satellites we can't shoot down 
 
382 
 00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,401 deserves to be taken seriously. 
 
                383 00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,195 
[Stone] And did your father say that too?

                385 00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,576 
Keep an eye on Colonel Carrera. 
 
386 
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,330 
Let's make sure he doesn't come up with another reason to stay.

        The Array has no evidence of a decommissioned hotel in this area. 
 
389 
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,056 
         Well, the guy who owns it pays a lot of money to keep it that way.

Hmm. 
One of your more unsavory acquaintances?

-Of course. 
 
                399 00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,833 
-Where are we going again? 
-I just told you, twice.

00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,750 Oh.

I am Tanaseda Hideki. This is my property.

                454 00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,600 
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

You recited it to me almost 300 years ago

                498 00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,833 
Well, someone went savage on him.

The last time you were here, 
 
501 
    00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:17,180 you suspected your sister had hidden Quellcrist Falconer's DHF. 
 
502 
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,726 
Has it ever occurred to you that Reileen was lying? 
 
503 
    00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:26,731 That Axley merely dangled Falconer's whereabouts to bend you to his will?

507 
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,867 That's not love.

520 
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,627 
We can't quantify the change, but we are not the same.

                528 00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,965 it alters beyond recognition. 
 
529 
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,553 Time tears down everything. 
 
530 
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,891 
We brace our backs against the void, 
 
531 
    00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,603 desperate to hold on to the past... 
 
532 
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,690 to our ghosts...

535 
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,218 Ah.  
536 
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,428 My apologies, sir. 
 
537 
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,890 
I'm afraid our old haunt is much like myself, 
 
538 
    00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,893 in a state of broken-down disarray.

[crumbling] 
 
540 
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:07,243 
   Perhaps "The Nevermore" would be a more apt moniker. 
 
541 
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,870 Is there whiskey? 
 
542 
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:17,670 I believe the former tenants left a passable bottle of... 
 
543 
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,799 Oh! Single malt. 
 
                544 00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:22,925 [Kovacs] Then it's fine. 
 
545 
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,637 
        All I want is a bed and no more bullshit for one day. 
 
546 
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:32,685 
Hmm, can I infer you... triumphed against adversity once again? 
 
547 
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,187 
I'm on a planet I hate, 
 
548 
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,983 
I don't know who killed Axley or how I'll find them, 
 
549 
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,986 and I'm no closer to Quell 
than I was before. 
 
550 
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,572 So... 
 
551 
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,033 that's a no. 
 
552 
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,785 Good night, Poe. 
 
553 
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,547 Good night, sir. 
 
554 
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,572 I can't do this anymore. 
 
555 
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:33,287 
This wild-goose chase across the stars, running after you. 
 
556 
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,335 This isn't true, is it? 
 
557 
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,422 You're just a figment... 
 
558 
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,633 in my head. 
 
559 
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,011 That's all there is left. 
 
560 
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,098 You're gone. 
 
561 
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,768 You have your answer, Tak. 
 
562 
        00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,063 -It's in the one place you're not looking. 
-I don't know what that means. 
 
563 
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,525 
  When we made stacks, we thought we severed the mind from the body, 
 
564 
   00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,318 but the truth is more complicated. 
 
565 
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,822 
I'm done with complicated. 
Either you're dead or you're not. 
 
566 
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,201 
Our bodies know things, 
 
567 
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,453 our skin, our bones,

 00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,373 our flesh hold our experiences.

What does your body, this body, remember? 
 
570 
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,342 Feel what you felt... 
 
571 
    00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,178 then you can remember what you saw.
