What's their temperature?

Does it get above chilly?

Well, they'll be there, anyway.

Mm-hmm. That is true.

Forty-eight more hours.

I'm calling the moving company
this afternoon.

Whenever. Jonah and I are packed.

Too soon?

- [Marty] Yeah. Much.
- Okay.

Well, um, we found an old stack
of hundreds from the Blue Cat wall.

[Marty] Really?

We just decided to leave it
for someone to find one day.

We put it in the Bible.

[chuckling] Well, that will go
unfound for a long time.

Incredible, and we've doubled our

[music drifts away]

[party music playing faintly]

[indistinct chatter]

["Tierra Mexicana" by C-Kan
blasting on stereo]

[children screaming joyfully]

Can you fix that?

[door opens]

[door closes]

[menacing music playing]

["Brillo" by Niña Dioz playing]

You two are celebrities.

How so?

The US Army raided the Lagunas compound.

You two brought the full force of the
American government down on their enemy.

So, salud.

Mmm.

My uncle tells me you're from Chicago.

Oh, please tell me nothing has changed.

Well, it's been a little while
since we lived there.

Wendy, Marty, this is Javier.

Javi. He's my sister's little boy.

He went to business school in Chicago.

LU.

[Marty] Good school.

Eh, it's fine.

What it is, however, is downtown.

[Omar] Mmm.

I miss it. I'm going back
to Chicago soon, on business.

Ah, well, if by business you mean
bottle service and loose women, well...

Ah. I'll give you a full report. Heh.

So, uh...

Darlene Snell.

What do you plan to do?

What do you mean?

- I am getting the name right, aren't I?
- Yeah.

The poppy farmer...

who killed Del and poisoned our product
when she was supposed to be our partner.

You got the name right, I just...
I don't understand what you mean.

[Javi] Before she passed,

Helen told us that this woman
was planning to replant her poppies.

Near our casino.

Small annoyances weigh on my nephew.

I had a good teacher.

He said that to lose face
was to lose everything.

Which is why Marty has been tasked
with making her stop, no?

Yes. We're on it.

Gonna shut that down.

Good. Now, if you'll excuse us,

we have some things
we need to discuss. Huh?

Salud.

Please.

My nephew is impatient.

His entire generation is.

So, this, um, craziness with Darlene,
uh, we can just ignore her, she's...

No. That you must do.

Your greatest threat will always come
from the inside, Marty. Never forget that.

I thought business school would
make my nephew more prudent,

but he's pushing against me,

searching for cracks.

And if he senses any weakness, well,

he'll try and make a move.

What kind of move?

He'll kill me.

And you.

Well, anyone who
he sees as important to me,

which is why he can never know
what we're about to speak of.

What God knows, he knows, Wendy.

You will use your influence
to allow me to walk away.

Well, uh, what does that mean, exactly?

I will walk away from my business.

I will be free of the threat
of arrest or assassination.

And I will be able to move freely
to the United States, back and forth,

where you have established
my children's business empire.

I'm sorry, that's impossible.

- Please don't use that word, Wendy.
- What other word could I use?

Uh, I think...

I think what Wendy means is that the...

the FBI, uh, they don't make any

agreements that aren't
advantageous to them.

I am aware that I will
have to make some concessions.

- [Wendy] Concessions?
- Yes.

Concessions.

[suspenseful drumbeat throbbing]

Isn't this exactly what
you were doing, Wendy?

With your foundation?

The brand?

What? You can transform yourself
into a pillar of society,

but you won't do the same for me?

[Marty] You know, to be fair, we're not...
We're not globally-recognized

cartel leaders on every
most wanted list in the world.

Well. Do this and you are free
of your obligation to me.

I'm sorry, it's...

It's just...

not doable.

Okay, then why are you still alive?

This is what I want.

This is why I chose you.

[chuckles softly]

Now please, go and enjoy the party.

I spent over $10,000 on crab alone.

[woman] Can I help you?

Oh no, I'm just... just waiting on someone.

You're that maid that used to work here.

Till you fucking fired me,
held back my last check.

Well, you ripped off half my guests.

I should have stole your makeup bag,

saved us both
an uncomfortable fucking situation.

[woman scoffs]

I'm calling the sheriff.

Mr. Benton.

- You must be Miss Langmore.
- Yes. Hi.

Stan Benton. Lorna, we're gonna
borrow your office if that's okay.

[Lorna] Of course, yeah.

[Ruth chuckles]

[Stan] Just trying to get
my head around it.

[Ruth] No I... I understand.

[Stan] So you're offering to buy
this place outright for $450,000?

Mm-hmm. Uh...

you can see here,
I'm approved for a business loan

from the First Bank of Osage.

It's a good offer.

Uh, well, it's a really good offer.

[Ruth] So?

[Stan exhales]

[sighing] Oh...

Oh Lord.

It's just all rushing back. [chuckles]

Mm. I'm sure. [forced chuckle]

I mean, I watched my kids
grow up running around this place.

Right.

Heck, I even watched
Lorna's kids grow up here.

[Ruth] Hmm.

And I'm sure they're all
fine specimens of human...

Um, but you're staring down a recession

and I'm offering you
ten percent above market.

Yeah, I know. It's just um...

Well, how about this. What say I waive
any inspections and we get this done?

Why?

[Ruth] Why?

Well, why do you want the Lazy-O?

[scoffs] Because I'm... I'm sentimental?

'Cause, uh, I got ADD
and need something new?

Does it matter? [chuckles]

A little bit. Yeah.

[tense music builds slowly]

I want to own a piece of this town.

When city people come on vacation,
I want to be the face they see.

My place, representing.

Pleasure doing business with you.

Oh, and uh, Lorna darling,
you're fucking fired.

[Wyatt] The Lazy-fucking-O!

[laughing] I made it seem like
the place really meant something to me.

- [both chuckle]
- Oh Christ.

Remember the fucking raccoons
that used to live under the ice machine?

I told him I wanted
to show all the tourists

how special we could be here.

They used to make me use this leaf blower
every day, even if it was completely bare.

I must have blown the same ten leaves
around that place for a fucking year.

[Ruth laughing]

I think you two
are just a step ahead of me.

What actually made you want to buy
some fleabag motel anyway?

I mean, we need a business
to launder money through.

Oh no, hun.

No, that's not a problem.
We got... We got a system.

From what I can tell,

Jacob mostly depended
on a wink and a handshake

with Henry down at First Osage.

We can't rely on that no more.

I can set up numbered accounts,
take us offshore.

And you bought this place in your name?

Well, it... it shields the farm to have it
in a separate name, launder-wise,

but it does bring up a question
about our partnership.

We should probably talk percentages.

[Wyatt] Oh no,
we don't need to talk about money.

No. Ruth is right.
It's best to be direct and clear.

Um, well, what seems fair to me,
seeing as it's your farm,

you get 50% and me and Wy
will split the other half, 25 each.

Your cut seems fair.

Wyatt and I will split
the other 75% evenly between us.

I'm gonna get us some champagne!

[door creaks and closes]

[Jonah] Hey.

[Ruth] Hey.

[Jonah sighs]

I thought you should have these.

It's... It's Ben's ashes.

He loved you.

He loved you too.

I don't think you should work
for my parents anymore.

I don't. I quit.

I ask why.

Why don't you think
I should work for your parents?

Because my mom was the one
who had Ben killed.

So, you know?

Thanks.

You come visit him.

Anytime.

See that couch?

He really loved that couch.

Your parents know these ashes are missing?

They're in Mexico.

Huh.

Fuck.

- [softly] Fucking piece of shit.
- [door opens]

What are you doing here?

Marty asked for me
to cover for him while he's in Mexico.

Get away from the desk.

- Charlotte, what's going on?
- Get away from the fucking desk.

Kenny!

You don't gotta do that.

I talked to my parents
before they left for Mexico,

which is why I'm here covering.

Kenny, she needs to be gone, now.

Escort her out and make sure
she doesn't come back.

- Yes, ma'am.
- Well...

Okay, okay, okay.

Fine.

I'll leave.

[methodical drumbeat playing]

Wendy?

Charlotte? Jonah?

[Charlotte] It's fine!

We're fine.

What happened?

[exhales]

But, we have some issues.

[Marty] What the hell happened?

I shot the windows out.

Why? Why'd you shoot the windows out?

I was upset because mom killed Ben.

Tell me it isn't true.

It's not that simple.

That's not what Helen said.

Well, she's wrong.

[Jonah] Yeah, let's give her a call.
See what she says.

Helen's dead.

So...

So Ben didn't have to die?

[Marty] Jonah, um, listen...

No! No, if Helen was going to die anyway,

then there's no reason
for Ben to be killed.

[Marty] Well, the world
doesn't work like that, pal.

[doorbell chimes]

You guys expecting somebody?

- Can I help you?
- Hi, Marty Byrde?

- [Marty] Can I help you?
- Hi, my name is Mel Sattem,

I'm a private investigator
up from Chicago, I'm...

Hi.

I'll keep this super short, I'm looking
for Helen Pierce, your business partner.

Seems she kind of
dropped off the face of the Earth.

It's my job to find her
so that she can sign some documents.

- It's not a great time.
- Well, long story short...

Her husband's trying to expedite
the divorce so he can get remarried.

Love, am I right?

Uh, I have no idea where she is.
Honey, have you heard from her?

[Wendy] No.

No, she planned to go home to Chicago.
I assumed she was there.

Should we be worried?

[Mel] Oh no, no, no.
It's probably just games.

You know, legal maneuvering,
nasty divorce.

The only problem is I don't get
a signature, I don't clock out.

I don't clock out... I get squirrelly.

[chuckling] But... not your problem.

- Sorry we were unable to help.
- Okay.

You should talk to her daughter, Erin.

See what she knows.

I'll do that. Thank you.

Why don't you leave me your card
and if I hear from her, I'll let you know.

- [Mel] All right.
- [Marty] Okay.

- Appreciate it.
- You got it, Mel.

[Charlotte sighs]

[car engine turns over]

Clean this shit up.

[door closes]

[Wyatt] You okay?

Mmm. It's probably just the champagne.

Are you happy?

Of course I'm happy.

You didn't have to do that, you know?

With the percentages.

- Zip your mouth.
- Okay.

What's mine is yours.

Just... thanks for bringing Ruth into this.

I wouldn't want it any other way.

[drink pouring]

I, um, I put a... new lock
on the gun cabinet

and I stored all the shells in the safe.

I shouldn't have snapped at him.

Well, he shot up the house, you know?

Still.

Maybe ease up just a little,
you know, considering.

How do you explain this to a teenager

whose only job is
to hate you in the first place?

[Marty] Jonah doesn't hate anything.

He doesn't, he's...
You know, he just needs a breath.

And he's... He's smart.

He's... He's going to see
that we just need to

push through to the other side,

and then we'll be free of the cartel

and we're gonna have
all the political capital we need

to change people's lives, Wendy.

I'm not fucking losing.

I believe you.

So, how do we not lose?

The only way anyone
ever not loses anything.

We need large numbers of money
and then we need to buy all the people.

I have a call into Jim Rettelsdorf.

Good.

And then somehow we have to turn
Omar Navarro into a model citizen.

Yeah.

And then we need to convince Darlene Snell
to shut down her heroin operation.

Of course we do.

[woman] Working
in conjunction with Federales,

the US Special Forces
breached the compound here.

Members of the Lagunas Cartel
returned fire.

Four members of the cartel were killed,

including the organization's
third in command.

We were able to confiscate heroin
with a street value of $350 million,

as well as cash
and a small arsenal of weapons.

I'd like to applaud Agent Miller
for the intel that led to the raid.

[all applauding]

This is a rundown of the insight that
we gleaned on the Lagunas operation.

Please review it before our next briefing.

Thank you.

Agent Miller, a moment?

I know how much the chance
to be in the field means to you.

Stay in Jefferson City.
I want you near the Ozarks.

When you get back from maternity leave,

I am not sending you back
to forensic accounting.

Congratulations.

Thank you, ma'am.

[Wendy, sarcastically] Oh good.
The kids could make it.

[Marty] Should we get started?

Not until our other partner gets here.

Partner?

[Ruth] Fucking hell, Kenny,
I am supposed to be here!

Mr. Byrde.

[Marty] She's... She's fine. Thank you.

Thank you, Kenny.

What about your Amazon lawyer?
We waiting on her?

[Marty] We are not.

Good to go.

You're laundering money for them?

That's why you were in Marty's office
trying to steal his software.

Couldn't make it on your own. Is that it?

So what's this message
from Mexico that's so important

you had to drag us all in here?

Uh, the Navarro Cartel has been
made aware by you, Darlene,

that you intend
to start producing heroin again,

and they have instructed us
to warn you not to.

- [Darlene laughing]
- [Marty] Not a joke.

- No?
- [Marty] No.

Darlene and Jacob ran their farm

well before you guys
ever even came to the Ozarks, so...

Okay, but we did come.
It's a different world now, that's a fact.

[Darlene] So is the fact that
I don't give a good goddamn

what you or your Mexicans
have to say about anything.

Okay, but if you don't do this,

their response is gonna be quick
and it's gonna be brutal.

We're just the messengers here.

[scoffs]

Right.

Because you don't take
fucking action. Do you?

- That's for other people.
- This isn't a personal squabble.

- This is real.
- [scoffing] Oh!

Oh, I know it's fucking real.

[Wendy] No, you don't.

Helen worked for that cartel
for ten years,

they blew her brains out two feet from us.

We had to wash
pieces of her out of our hair.

That's real.

[Marty] So we had a moral obligation
to give you this news.

Your life is in danger,
so is Wyatt's, so is Zeke's.

I'll worry about my family. Thank you.

Now unless there's
anything else you have to say?

That's it.

Ruth. Ruth.

Please make her listen.

Don't get yourself killed.

Like you fucking care.

[Marty] Of course I care.

[Wendy] Don't bother. She's made her bed.

Ruth.

Hey, look, don't let them get to you,
okay? You don't work for them anymore.

I kind of thought of Helen
like some giant fucking machine,

like a thresher or some shit.

I didn't think
she could be fucking killed.

Don't worry, Darlene's got this. Okay?

Look, I should go.

No, Wendy's right.

No, I... I'm fucked.

I... I need Marty's software.

I know how to run the system.

I just don't know
how to build the fucking system.

- You'll figure it out. I'm sure.
- I'm... I'm serious.

So am I! I have faith.

Why?

Because you're Ruth fucking Langmore!
That's why!

[truck engine turns over]

[Mel] But she hasn't returned
phone calls in two days.

[Nix] Yeah, well, I'm afraid
this is the first I'm hearing about it.

So, you check back here in 48 hours

and I can consider her a missing person.

I know. But in the meantime,
it's just, maybe you could, uh...

you know, run by her place,
check inside, find out what she's up to,

see if there's any signs
of foul play, you know?

Sheriff stuff.

To be honest, I don't know what business
Helen Pierce had here in the Ozarks

and I don't want to know.

What does that mean?

[sighs] Nothing.

Dude, I just need a signature. Please.

I got a cat that misses me in Chicago,
her name's Loretta Lynne.

She's gonna chew her own paw off
if I don't get back to her in time,

so just give me a little help
and I'll be out of your life forever.

Well, I'm sorry, but it sounds like
you've got a divorce case

and a wife who doesn't want
her husband to find her,

and that's not my business.

Right.

Well...

Just in case you change your mind.

[elevator dings]

[Maya] I'm not supposed to speak to you
with your hearing pending.

Right. Because you're by the book.

It's not my fault
you're getting disciplined.

You reported me!

Because you accepted
a confession you knew was false.

- And you knew could get someone killed.
- See, you...

I've busted my ass for 15 years.

I'm trying to take drugs off the street.
I'm trying to save people's lives.

Same as you. Fifteen years.

- What do you want?
- I want...

I want you to understand all that
before you get in front of the board

and make it sound like
it's something it's not.

You want to know the truth?

Straight up?

Straight up.

I don't give a shit about your motivation.

The only thing that matters is
what you did, and what you did was wrong.

- Now, you need to leave me be.
- See...

You don't get to have it both ways.

You don't get to act like
you're on the high road

when you really down here
on the ground with the rest of us.

- You know what I think? I...
- What?

That I'm a hypocrite?

That I'm a purist who makes compromises?

You gonna tell me how other agents
think I got a commendation

for being the pawn
of a drug cartel operative,

so how dare I look at the world
as black and white?

Is that the truth you about to drop?

Get yourself home.

You don't want them to see you here
while you're suspended.

[menacing music playing]

Thank you for cleaning up the living room.

Didn't think I had a choice.

[Wendy] You didn't...
but I appreciate it anyway.

Speaking of which, thank you
for dealing with Ruth at the casino.

[Charlotte] Yeah, of course.

What did Ruth do?

Ruth tried to steal
the proprietary financial software

that I wrote for the, um, shell companies.

Would she even be able
to reconcile the accounts

if she doesn't have access
to the offshore servers?

Okay, the point is...

she's not our people anymore.

And if she comes anywhere
near the casino, or this house,

you stay away from her
and you let us know immediately.

I've already spoken to Matt in security
and he's briefed every shift change.

Good.

- Good.
- [Charlotte chuckles]

[Wendy] You spoken to Maya yet?

No, she won't return my calls.

Well, that's not good.

I thought we were done with the FBI.

Well, we're gonna need Maya's help

because, uh, we have been asked to, uh...

uh, essentially launder Omar Navarro.

- [Jonah] That's impossible.
- No it's not.

What exactly do you mean by "launder him"?

Well, he wants to be free
to come and go between US and Mexico,

uh, in return for...

uh, I don't know, helping
the government when they need it.

- It's just not possible.
- [Wendy] It is.

[Marty] You know, the important thing is,
if all goes well, we have a promise

that we're free
of our obligation to him, okay?

In six months we could be
completely out from under this.

Okay?

Yeah, in third grade, we learned
about the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.

There were like 600 acres
and on the grounds there's this building

called the Hall for Prayer
for Good Harvests.

It's circled by this thing
called the Echo Wall.

- Okay. Okay, we get it.
- [Jonah] Even when people are whispering,

you just hear the same things
repeated over and over...

Okay, enough. You want to be a smart-ass?

You want to hate me? Fine.

But everything
your father is saying is true.

And with our foundation,

everything this family has sacrificed,

everything,

is gonna at least give us the power
to do whatever good we want to do.

We... We can be the most
powerful family in the Midwest.

With the full endorsement
of the goddamn FBI to boot.

People will find out
where the money came from.

You need to grow up. This is America.

People don't care
where your fortune came from

and in two election cycles,

it'll be just some... some myth,

some gossip.

Some fucking cocktail party.

[knocking on sliding door]

I think your doorbell's broken.

Jesus Christ. This guy.

We're having dinner, okay?

[Mel] I... I just need a second.

Well, it's sacred time, we're eating.

This is you, right? At Helen's house?

I was angry because
she had my uncle committed.

Jonah, be quiet.

If you look at the rest of the footage,
you'll see she was alive when I left.

Okay, enough.

Why would you think she's dead?

How'd you get this?
Did you have a warrant?

I just show you a picture of your son
holding a shotgun on your business partner

and that's what you're worried about,
a warrant?

This is a... This is a family matter, okay?

Look, I just need a signature, dude...

Thank you for bringing it
to our attention. Good night.

[Mel] I just need a signature!

[Marty] Okay. I, uh...
I think that this is a time

where we all just need to make sure
we don't lose our heads.

- What the fuck were you doing?
- Wendy.

I went there to shoot her
before she could kill our whole family.

That's when she told me
what you did to Ben.

- Did you know about this?
- Not that part.

- Don't walk away.
- Where do you think you're going?

- Out.
- [Wendy] No, you're not!

[Marty] Hey, I'm serious.
This is all very complicated.

We need to sit
and talk it out like a family.

You're not leaving this fucking house!

Can you calm down, please?
Everybody just stay calm.

I am calm.

All right, I'm completely calm.

- And I know you can't stop me.
- Bullshit, I can't!

- You're grounded.
- Can you dial that down just a tiny bit?

You don't think attempted murder
is cause for grounding?

[tense music playing]

I have a key. You don't need to stay up.

Don't!

Hey, I'm... I'm sorry, I can go.

No, I was serious. Anytime.

Hey.

Here. Catch.

You know, I have my own software.

For money laundering.

And I made tweaks to my Dad's.
Mine's better.

But the accounts have been up
and running for a while now, and you can...

And you can have them if you want.

Why would you do that?

Thanks.

You should probably know, I'm...
I'm working with Darlene.

I know you guys had some shit in the past

with your hair and all.

[chuckles softly]
It looks good, by the way.

You, um...

You know she's crazy, right?

[Ruth chuckles]

Well, yeah.

But who the fuck isn't?

And this way, I got to work with Wyatt.

Hey.

Those accounts...
are they really up and running?

You ever had a red flag?

No.

What if you did the laundering for me?

You know, I bought the Lazy-O Motel.

[chuckles] That's where
you first stole from us.

It's a fucking perfect place
to run receipts through.

Look, I um... I'm... I'm not...

I'm not sure.

No, right.

No, I mean, it's just...

Seriously. Forget it.

Um...

You stay as long as you want.

[phone buzzing]

Hey, uh, Maya. It's Marty again.

Uh, if you could, please call me back.
It's... It's really important. Um...

It's important for, uh, for me,

um, for uh...

for the uh...

for the Bureau. Um...

Anyway, call me back
when you can, please. Thank you.

Hey, there.

- [Javi] Hola.
- Hi, what a surprise.

I was in Chicago for work. Uh...

I have some new restaurant recommendations
for you and Wendy, by the way.

[Marty] Oh. Thank you.

Anyway, I figured I'd come
and check out the operation.

- It's beautiful.
- [Marty] Well, yeah.

So much classier than I imagined.

Oh yeah?

New Orleans style, huh?

Um, yeah, it is.

So, tell me.

That hillbilly cunt.

Does she still think she can
push her heroin in our backyard?

You know what? Um...

This place has been crawling with feds.

I don't think it's a good idea
for you to be here.

Hmm. You're right. Mmm.

We'll go to your place.

My place?

We can get pastries.

[door opens and closes]

[footsteps approaching]

Where did you go last night?

Why? So you can tell Mom and Dad?

No, I'm just worried about you.

I just rode my bike around.

You need to get your shit together,
you're starting to scare me.

Hey, their plan is make believe.

- We need to give them time.
- We have.

All Mom cares about is protecting us.

Her killing Ben is the same as you
killing me. Can you imagine killing me?

This is different. Ben was mentally ill.

That's not an answer.

Mom's right. You do need to grow up.

[Jonah] And maybe you need
to get some opinions of your own.

[door opens and slams shut]

Javi was just wondering
how things were going with Darlene.

I brought us pastries.

[Wendy] That is so nice of you.

Yeah. Yeah.

I um... I told him that we had a very, uh...

productive initial meeting.

Yeah, that's right. Uh...

We have to progress very carefully

because you know
she controls the local sheriff, so,

we don't want her to set his sights on us.

- But you made headway?
- Oh yeah. Yeah.

Good... Good headway.

Well, let's fucking hope so. Gracias.

So...

Do you have to go back
to Mexico this afternoon?

You know, I thought
I might take a day or two here.

Kick back a little. Relax.

Oh, that's nice. Where are you staying?

At Helen's.
You know, since she's not using it.

[Marty] Mm-hmm.

[Javi sighs]

Gracias.

I need to confess.

Um, when my uncle first told me about
your disagreement with Helen,

my vote was to kill the two of you.

No offense.

Of course not.

I miss Helen.

She was sexy.

Like a scary, mean teacher.

[chuckles lightly]

Clearly, my uncle has confidence in you.

After all, you've delivered a casino
and the intervention of the US government.

Mm-hmm. Yeah, we keep our heads down
and we just stay at it.

How's your work going
setting up assets for his children?

Good. Of course, it was Helen
who was handling the legal end of things.

[Javi] Right.

Right.

["Can I Kick It?"

So nice to get to do this.

Hmm.

["Bam Bam" by Sister Nancy

[doorbell chimes]

I'm looking for Helen Pierce.

I'm her friend.

I'm staying here
while she's away for a while.

Is everything okay?

Do you know how I can
get in touch with her?

[chuckles]

You're the sheriff.

Like...

Like, the... sheriff.

[Nix] That's right. That's me.

Wow. [chuckles]

[Nix] I just need to find
a way to get a hold of her.

Hold on a sec.
Let me turn the music down.

[volume increases]

- Did he tell you where he went?
- He said he just rode around on his bike.

You believe him?

I mean, it's not like him to lie.

Um. I, uh...

[sighs] I think we got to be careful to...
have a consistent voice. Okay?

- I know.
- Yeah.

I just, I think that, you know, we just...

We can't contradict
each other in front of the kids.

I think we should be parenting
from the same direction, you know?

You're right.

I vote forward.

[car honks]

I solved your problem.

Come have a look.

You own a crematorium.

Right?

[ominous music playing]

[intense driving drumbeat playing]

[clock ticking]

[bugs chirring]

[Bruce] Marty Byrde,
you're my best friend. I love you. I do.

But you're living
a tragically subdued life.

[Marty] Mm-hmm.

And how is it...
How is it we make the same bank,

and yet I could see my place
in Trump Tower from here

and you're driving a ten-year-old
Camry with cloth fucking seats?

Nothing wrong with that Camry,
and... and I do just fine sex-wise.

- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

Really? Says the man watching DIY porn

Don't you love it?

[Marty] It's nice. Very nice.

- [Bruce] It's "nice"?!
- [Marty] Yeah.

Fuckin' nice?
I'm in that corner, you're in that corner.

Twenty people working for us.
Boom, boom, boom.

I mean, this is southern facing, right?

[line ringing]

This is Bruce Liddell. Leave me
a message, and I'll call you back.

[beeps]

Hey, Bruce. Marty.

Buddy, let's... let's pull the trigger
on that office. Okay?

Let's... Let's... Let's lock that down.

I... I do think it would be nice to get
a look at some utility comps from Liz

if she can get her hands on some,
but I do think that we should do it.

You know, let's do it. Um...

The parking, however,
is something that we didn't talk about.

And I'm sure that the city
is going to want their 1%.

But... But I do... I do think
that... that we should...

We should...
we should think hard about this.

Definitely. And...

you know, we'll review
the lease agreement,

we'll take another walk through,
and... and, um...

You know, there...
there is the possibility that

there's another space
that we might like better. Uh...

But, um...

Uh, well, so I guess...

don't tell Liz
that we're going to take it.

Just tell her that you and I are gonna
talk about it face-to-face.

We're gonna hash it all out
on Monday. All right?

All right. Bye.

[phone beeps off]

[clock resumes ticking]

[sighs]

[ominous music playing]

[outbound message whooshes]

Love you.

Love you too.

[sinister music playing]

[trailer door slams]

We just take whatever we can fit.

But otherwise we can just buy new shit
when we get where we're goin'.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh. What're you doing?

Get your guitar and your hoodie
with the... the linin' in it.

Uh, I gotta talk to you.

[Ruth] What?

[Wyatt sniffling]

I'm gonna marry Darlene.

- [Wyatt chuckles]
- [Ruth scoffs]

Are you fuckin' with me?

Are you not fuckin' with me?

If... If I don't do it,
then Zeke's gonna end up in a foster home.

I'm sorry. It's for the baby.

Then take the damn baby.
You want me to go get the fuckin' baby?!

- I'll go grab that damn baby right now!
- Ruth!

No, you're not fucking doing this!

Well, you can't tell me what to do.

The fuck I can't.
She killed the head of the KC Mob

and that's gonna come back on her.

And if you stay,
that'll come back on you too.

No one knows that she did that
aside from you and me.

No, I know that.

All I'm saying is that she's dangerous.

She loves me, Ruth.

I love you.

[quavering] I... I don't want to go.

[chuckles] I... I never wanted to go.

Then why'd you say it?

I don't know.

Fuck you!

You're a fucking child!

And you're not marrying Darlene Snell!

- I'm not doing this with you.
- No, you... you promised to come with me.

You know what?

I'm sorry. Okay?

I'm sorry that you're sad.

I'm sorry that your boyfriend died.

And I'm sorry that you're lonely.

Okay? But I love her.

And I'm gonna marry her.

[quavering] No, j-just wait a minute.

A goddamn minute.
Just wait one fuckin' second.

[shuddered breathing]

Can... Can I at least come to the wedding?

[melancholy music playing]

[engine turns over]

[crow squawks]

[crow continues squawking]

[Jim] Omar Navarro has ceded power
to his nephew Javier Emilio Elizondro.

In exchange for freedom of mobility
and promise of immunity,

Mr. Navarro has provided information
necessary not only to apprehend Elizondro,

but also to neutralize
the Navarro Cartel entirely...

I'm gonna stop you right there.

The Bureau has had time
to reflect on the situation,

and we have decided
that you will be staying on

as head of the cartel
for the next five years.

Now, your client will provide
intelligence when called upon,

and we will continue to coordinate
with him on the monetary seizures.

After five years,

we can grant your client
immunity from prosecution

in the United States.

Can grant immunity.

That's a very interesting choice of words.

We're gonna stop here,
and we will reconvene

after I've had a chance
to talk with my client.

There will be no reconvening.

This happens today.

Absolutely not.

Could I have a word with you, ma'am?

We'll debrief after, Miller.

Respectfully, ma'am.

A moment, please.

If we're not here to take down
this organization, then,

all due respect,
what the fuck are we doing here?

You actually thought
we were gonna bring down

one of the biggest cartels
in North America?

Yes, I did.

Because that's what we've been
saying for months, ma'am. So yes.

And then what?

You think the War on Drugs just ends?

No one else fills that void?

We're collaborating so that we can
make progress on all of it.

Big picture.

And here I thought you were justifying

taking five more years' worth
of money seizures.

[Clay scoffs softly]

It's not the Bureau's job
to explain itself to you.

Why not tell me?

Why bushwhack me
in the middle of a meeting?

Because you're righteous.

And you border on liability.

My mistake was thinking you had enough
professionalism to keep your mouth shut.

Now I expect you to fall in line.

[Maya sighs]

This is quite a situation, Mr. Navarro.

With no time served,
this is an unprecedented offer.

Do you understand
what you're asking me to do?

I'm asking you to continue on,
business as usual.

Yeah, but you... you know,
you force him to Mexico,

you... you force a volatile situation

that will definitely interrupt cash flow.
I'm sure you don't want that.

No, they know exactly
what they want, Marty.

They want me to kill my nephew
and pay for the privilege.

I acknowledge the difficulties
dealing with Mr. Elizondro may present,

but the Bureau is confident
that Mr. Navarro can handle it.

[sighing] Okay.

[clears his throat]

What can I offer you? Huh?

Right here, right now.

Name your price.

We're not looking for a payout.

We're looking for a relationship.

A relationship...

A relationship?!

How... How about one year?

How about a one-year relationship?

You... You could convince your nephew that...

that things are dragging
on the financial side.

You... You could downplay
the transition there,

and you, you could reconsider
Mr. Navarro's offer of a one-time fee,

in addition to a year
of intelligence and continued seizures.

The Bureau doesn't compromise
with mass murdering drug traffickers.

It's our position that warlords
and violent criminals

should be grateful when we show mercy.

You would be wise to make this work.

[Marty] Guess it's better
than no deal at all, huh?

They send me home to kill my family
and expect me to do business with them.

I should end them all right now.

What about if, uh...

What about if you tell Javi
that there was a force majeure

with the legitimate holdings,
and that you need more time?

[grunts] I can't go back
on my word, Marty.

The boy is too stupid and too dangerous.

[Wendy] If you give the FBI
what they want right now,

you will get out.

It won't be today,

but you'll still be young.
Your children will still be young.

These people are liars.

In five years, they will fuck me again.

There is no guarantee. I know that.

But I'm not sure
you have a choice right now.

[Omar scoffs]

[shrieks] Ah! Jesus!

I will do that. Thanks.

[phone beeps off]

[Omar sighs]

Five years.

[Graves] We appreciate
your willingness to cooperate.

I'd offer to shake your hand,
but I see you've suffered an injury.

You know, I could have
my driver get a first aid kit.

Mr. Navarro, in five years' time

your prudence today will be remembered.

[Clay] Mr. and Mrs. Byrde,

the FBI will be assuming
your role for the Navarro Cartel.

You've brought us to this historic moment

and the Bureau thanks you
for your service to America.

You're welcome.

I should have known not to trust
the American government, huh?

Americans can be treacherous, no?

Some.

We didn't want this... like this.

How does it feel? Hmm?

[chuckles] Which part?

I don't know.

Going back to your normal life.

Shock.

No, that's not shock, Wendy...

That is fear.

Fear of the quiet.

It has been a pleasure
watching you work, Wendy Byrde.

Thank you.

Well, that'll do for now.

[in Spanish] You know what?

[in English] When your kids
are away in school, and

your husband is still in the office,

and the bottle of wine is empty,

and the house is dark and it's quiet,

don't forget about me.

What was that all about?

[Marty sighs]

He told me not to forget about him.

[Marty] Mmm.

[inhales sharply]

[sighs and chuckles]

[Wendy scoffs]

Should we call the kids?

[Marty sighs deeply]

Uh, let's take a moment.

[Wendy exhales]

No, I don't like their oat milk. Just, uh...

go to the place by my house. It's easier.

[phone buzzing]

This is Clare.

I am looking at your quarterlies.

[keyboard clacking]

Congratulations on making production.

Uh.

Thank you?

How exactly did that happen
without my product, Ms. Shaw?

I'd hate to hear
you're stepping out on me.

Uh...

Marty provided a stopgap.

Did you meet this stopgap?

No. I met with Marty and his old partner.

What old partner?

I can't remember her name. She's...

Um, she's tiny and has curly blond hair.

From now on, you'll be dealing with me.

[phone beeps off]

[line disconnects]

Don't worry about Jonah.
I'm gonna talk to him.

This is... This is good.
It's really, really good news.

So we can move back Chicago?

Yeah. Yes, we can.

And I can see my friends?

[chuckling] Yes. Absolutely, you can...
you can see your friends.

[trucks beeping]

[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

You can't do that thing
that we talked about.

Why is that? You beat me to it?

My cousin's gonna marry her,
so you can't kill her.

Who the fuck's your cousin?

[Ruth] Don't matter.

I already fucked up his life,
so, you can't kill his girlfriend.

Well, his girlfriend should have
thought about that before.

Why ain't you done it yet?

- You don't want to.
- Oh, no, I want to.

I just haven't gotten to it yet.

[Ruth] Hmm.

Let God sort the bitch out.

[inhales sharply]

Nature, then.

[Frank Jr scoffs]

There's a code for this type of shit.

No one ever has to know
what happened to your dad.

Nobody.

And you can take over
this whole fucking thing

and never have to kill nobody.

Ain't that the better option?

[Ruth clears her throat] Let's end it.

And I'm supposed to just
let this redneck bitch

shoot my dick off and kill my dad? Nah.

Listen, I'm begging you.

Now, I know we ain't had the best start,

but we aren't that different
from each other. And...

And I'm...

I'm... Fuck.

I-I... I'm just... I'm just asking you,

just please leave it.
Just please leave it alone.

Okay.

Okay. I won't touch her.

You... You have my word.

Okay.

[car door opens]

- [sirens wailing]
- [tires screeching]

[officer] Hands! Put 'em up!

[bodies thudding]

[distorted soundscape]

[voices echoing] Get on the ground!

Get on the ground!

Cuff him.

[Maya] Omar Navarro.

You are being placed under arrest.

You have the right to remain silent
and refuse any questioning.

Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

You have the right to an attorney
before speaking to the police.

[voice fading]
Or to have an attorney present...

- [high frequency droning]

[reporter] An incredible scene
in Central Missouri today

after authorities descended onto
a private airfield in Polk County

and arrested Mexican drug kingpin
Omar Navarro.

The scene is still very active,

as you can see behind me
with a very heavy police...

Holy shit.

You know, we have no idea
what Navarro is thinking.

You know, he could think
we had something to do with this

or Javi could think that we had
something to do with it. So we just...

We need to be careful, you know.
We need to stay aware and be careful.

- You listening to me?
- [Charlotte] Yes.

- Here.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

- [Charlotte] No.
- You don't have to use it.

- Well, then why do I have to take it?
- Charlotte!

Just get your brother,
get to the spot, and stay there.

[line ringing]

God damn it.
Why the fuck would Maya do this?

Yeah, well, you tell me.

All right, Charlotte,
I want you to, uh, be careful.

Keep your eyes open,
and your phone on at all times.

- [car starts]
- Okay, promise.

Our hands are tied.

The arrest is on every
media outlet in the fucking world.

The man has no idea
why he's sitting in a jail cell.

His default will be to kill anyone
who might have been involved.

Then I suggest you hide.

Well, what if... What... Hang on.

What if we do the same thing
with Javi instead?

Now that Maya has
screwed up our Navarro plan,

let's just do the same thing
with his nephew.

- We won't deal with Elizondro.
- No?

And that's... that's it? This is, uh...

I mean, the FBI has been
enjoying a cash infusion

of... of about what,
$30 million this quarter?

That's... That's a lot of law and order.
It's a lot of... [inhales sharply]

...task force funding and... and bonus bumps.

For the Bureau to do business
with Javier Elizondro...

[Wendy] We'll get you a higher fee.

Much higher.

I just... I need to talk to Navarro.

[scoffs] Not possible.

What if you talk to him?

The FBI's not going anywhere near the man.

Of course not.

None of this is happening.

[keypad beeping]

[line rings]

[Javi] I told my uncle, don't kill Helen.

Kill the other white meat.
He just wouldn't listen.

We had nothing to do with this.
This was one agent acting alone.

And now I get to kill you.

Hey, we can turn this
into an opportunity for you, Javi.

And I really want to kill you, you know?

[sighs deeply]

I'm gonna make a meal of it.

The airfield is taped off.
You can't get to your jet,

so just give us a little bit of time
on this, okay? Just some time.

I'll give you 90 minutes.

[phone beeps off]

[line disconnects]

[Marty sighs]

[reporter] While local authorities from
Polk County assisted with the arrest,

Navarro has been transferred
into federal custody.

The leader of what's rumored
to be the largest cartel in Mexico.

- What did you do?
- Navarro's been long on the FBI's list

- ...of Most Wanted fugitives.
- My job.

His arrest comes on the heels

of a recent escalation in
cartel-related violence in Mexico,

culminating in the dramatic
joint US/Mexico raid

of Navarro's longtime rival...

- [car approaching]
- ...the Lagunas Cartel.

Okay, I don't have time
for you to be an asshole.

I'm not a part of this anymore.
What don't you understand?

They're not up to date on
the inner workings of our family, Jonah,

and they will kill you.

[phone ringing]

Hey, Jim.

We need to get you insulated on this.

- Listen, I'll have to call you back.
- The entire operation

from the casino
to the smallest subsidiary,

has got to be bulletproof.

They are bulletproof.

No, I'm not going to prison over this.
There's some papers I need you to sign.

The papers can wait, Jim.

Get to my house right now

or I start making some phone calls
that make your life very difficult.

- [line disconnects]
- [Marty sighs]

I missed your mama.

You should watch it.

gonna give me a fucking cavity,

she caught my shed on fire?

- [chuckling] No.

He died in a boating accident,
bled to death on his Thundercat.

[sighs] Whatever happened to Cade?

That dick-washin' asshole.

He's dead.

Good. You're better off an orphan.

Sorry for your loss.

Now, I'm gonna give you
some Hungarian wax peppers.

But they're so hot, they'll bleach
your asshole from the inside out,

so proceed with caution.

[Ruth chuckles]

Thank you.

[knocking on door]

- Hey.
- Hi.

I'm sorry.

Yeah, I just wish that we could have
done this a bit later. I got stuff...

[grunting]

[panting] Javi, we didn't do this.

Okay? We had nothing to do with it.

Wendy is with your uncle right now.

Just let me explain.

Come on. Let me explain.

Let me exp... Ah! [groaning]

[clattering]

[door buzzes]

[prisoners chattering]

[Wendy] I need you to call Javi and tell
him you were working with the FBI.

You know we didn't do this.

We made a major error

when it came to Agent Miller.

But they still want Javi.

You... You heard Clay at the meeting.

Convince Javi to take the same deal
that you were gonna take.

If they get him in a room,
they can arrest him,

and they'll extradite you back to Mexico.
I've already worked it out.

You have that in writing?

They're not gonna put that in writing.

How do you think I'm here?

How do you think I got a phone in here?

This morning, you were
willing to give them everything.

This morning was a long time ago, Wendy.

[sinister music playing]

We can make this whole thing... [coughing]

...work to your advantage. Okay?

[Javi] Okay.

Just let me... [panting]

Just give me some time. Okay?

Okay, you know what? You're right.

Why don't you go grab a bottle of Scotch
and we'll sort this out?

- [Jim] Stop it!
- Shut the fuck up!

- [Marty groaning]
- [screaming] Shut the fuck up!

They will extradite you back to Mexico.

You can walk away from all of this,
I swear on my life.

On my children's lives. Just...

Call Javi.

[Marty] I can guarantee you
a deal with the US government.

Okay? You can run the whole cartel

with absolute freedom.

I can prove it.
It's exactly what your uncle was doing.

The FBI wants to make a deal.
They want to make a deal with you.

Blah, blah, blah.
You like your mouth, don't you?

I'm telling you the truth! [grunts]

[Javi groans]

[Marty groaning]

[panting] Javi!
Javi, Javi, Javi, Javi. Javi.

Javi, come... Come on.
Please, please, please.

- [phone ringing]
- [Marty panting]

Answer that.

Answer that.

Please, just answer that. That's them.

[phone continues ringing]

Please.

[phone beeps]

[in Spanish] Hello?

Yes, I understand.

[in English] Looks like
God gave you another day.

[Marty panting]

How about that Scotch?

Thank you.

We'll set a meeting
for the morning with Javi and the FBI.

I am out of this place in 48 hours
or Nelson has orders to end you.

So, for your sake,
I hope you're not fucking me.

I'm not.

You'll be out in 48 hours.

[Jonah] She tried to have me arrested.

[Charlotte] I'm not saying that it's good.

Then what are you saying, exactly?

I don't know.

I think they're doing the best they can.

[scoffs] I think you have
Stockholm Syndrome.

Don't act like
you've always been against this.

You know, you were
their little helper in the beginning,

and you wanted to move here

because you didn't have
any friends in Chicago.

So what did you care?

[scoffs]

You are exactly like Mom.

Fuck you.

Yeah. See?

Look, I'm sorry.

I-I don't want to fight and

I'm not siding with Mom. Okay?

I'm really not.

After Ben died, I asked you
if you'd have me killed.

You said, "It's not the same thing.
He had a mental illness."

I just needed you to say,
"I'd never kill you. Don't be insane."

I'd never kill you.

Don't be insane.

Well, thank you.

You ever think about
what you'd do if they were...

Dead?

Yeah, I've thought about it.

Have you?

You'd wanna stick together, right?

If they were?

Yeah.

If anything happened to them,

we'd run.

I know what we'd do.

We'd go to the...
Pacific Northwest or something, and

get an apartment
and we'd have new names and, um...

we'd be fine.

We're always going to be fine.

Okay?

[inhales]

I need a favor.

What kind of favor?

And... you just ever lose your fucking keys?

Or is every goddamn thing
with you DEFCON 5?

Well, you know, actually, uh,
DEFCON 1 is... is worse than DEFCON 5.

Well, they're all fucking bad, Marty.

All right, um, I need you to, um...

I need you to go by the house
in the morning.

And if... if Wendy and I are not there,

I need you to go
to where we hide the money. Okay?

And I need you to grab Charlotte and Jonah
and I need you to get them out of town.

Can you do that?

What the fuck's going on?

I'm just... I'm dealing with a...
with a very erratic guy.

Navarro.

His nephew and... his buddies.

Can you... Can you do this for me?

[inhales] Well, I'm sure
you'll tap dance your way

straight through whatever this is.

If I don't, can you help me?

Of course I fucking will.

Thank you.

Why would they make DEFCON 1
worse than DEFCON 5?

[waterfowl crying]

[keypad clicking]

We're just taking him.
We'll call you with a location. Come on.

[engine turns over]

[ominous music playing]

Good Lord.

See? You look nice!

Not bad, right?

It's weird you won't be there tomorrow.

[scoffs] Me not being there is the least
weird thing about this wedding.

True.

Think she's gonna, like,
eat him or something?

[scoffs] What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

- [Three laughing]
- Nobody's eatin' nobody.

But I can see how she'd strike you
as the eatin' type.

[Three grunts] Can I wear this too?

No. Now fix your hair back.

[Three sighs]

He doesn't want to meet here.
I got the call on the drive over,

but I have a safe location.
It's one of our businesses.

[Graves] Absolutely not.

But you... you were...
you were willing to meet with him.

Here.

We are so close!

It's over.

Look, if you don't help me,

I'll have nothing to lose
and I will expose everything you've done!

I don't think you want to learn,
in a very public way, I don't bluff!

Sealing the casket will prevent
Mrs. Donarski from biodegrading

as quickly as she would
were she not sealed.

Now, for even more protection
against the elements,

- a casket vault is very thoughtful.
- Harry, there you are. Hi, um, sir.

Uh, don't mean to interrupt, but we do
have to shut down, uh, for the day. Okay?

- Martin?
- [Marty] Yep?

- This is Chip Donarski.
- Okay.

His wife has recently passed.

Oh, well, I'm so sorry for your loss,

but I am going to
have to ask you to leave.

Alrighty?

Yeah. I know it.

But for your... for your...
For your troubles,

we're gonna, let's...

we'll knock 15% off of this.

Okay? Is this the one you like?

She's a beauty, okay?

Twenty percent,
we're going to do 20%. Okay?

Or 25, I don't care.
I need you out in five minutes, damn it.

[Chip sighs]

Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today

to join this man and this woman
in bonds of holy matrimony.

You'll run the cartel freely
as long as you continue to meet

the fiscal stipulations we've agreed to.

[Javi] And immunity?

After ten years' time.

However, should anyone
outside of our agreement

ever learn about any of this,

you can expect
the full force of the Bureau

to come knocking at your door.

- That goes for all of you.
- Oh, no, no no.

God forbid the full force.

[Javi scoffs]

[tense music builds]

[Clay] We have a deal?

We do.

I do.

I now pronounce you husband and wife.

You can go ahead and kiss your bride.

[Zeke gurgling]

Thank you.

[softly] Of course.

[snickers]

[Wendy] If anything happens to us,
your children lose access to that money.

[Marty] Any legal entity
that you've built for them,

any legitimate capital
would no longer be viable.

What happened to us, Wendy?

[Marty] As long as our family is safe...

My children will want for nothing.

My reach is deep. Is that all?

Javi doesn't know that you gave him
and the entire cartel up to the FBI.

We kept that to ourselves
to preserve your life.

But you know your nephew.

He'd want you to suffer for
a betrayal like that, don't you think?

And with a... a... a guy unstable that, uh...

well...

You know, he could go after your kids.

You didn't have to put
your children in hiding today.

In a tomb.

With a shotgun?

I don't kill children.

I don't threaten to kill children.

We didn't mean for it to turn out this
way, believe it or not. We really didn't.

You disappoint me.

Especially you, Wendy.

[door buzzes]

So what are you gonna do now?

Get a burrito.

After that.

[Jonah] Oh.

Go back to the Lazy-O.

Are you sure that
you don't want to come home?

I'll be there.

Look, I, uh... I gotta pick up
the rest of my stuff in the morning.

So, I'll... I'll see you then.

Okay.

Charlotte, I'm so sorry.

It's okay.

Where's your brother?

He went back to the motel.

[somber music plays]

[fluid pouring]

We'll hammer all that out
over the next few days.

[Clare] I, um...

I don't want any face time with him.

He's disgusting.

Javi is disgusting,
but after this next meeting,

you're not gonna have to deal with him.

[inhales sharply] Okay.

Okay. All right. Bye.

[front door shuts]

Jonah?

[Marty] Hey, buddy.

[Wendy] Hey.

I'm glad you're here.
I was gonna call you.

I wouldn't have picked up.
I'm just getting the rest of my things.

Jonah. There's a lot going on.

We need to discuss this as a family.

- [Jonah] I'll be downstairs.
- [phone ringing]

Uh, I'll... I'll go. I'll talk to him
in a second. Hold on.

Uh, hi. Hey, I'm glad you, uh,
you called me back.

Um... I, uh...

I... I wanted to... to tell you to...

[sighs]...to go ahead and...
and pull the trigger on that office.

Just, uh... Just... Just go ahead
and... and lock that in.

Yeah. Yeah, that... sounds good.
Just send it over.

Yeah, okay. Buh-bye.

[phone beeps off]

[Bruce] Be honest. When was the last time
you were really truly happy?

[smacks tongue] Oh, come on.

- Come on. I'm plenty happy.
- Okay, okay. You got me. You got me.

Ya got me. Financial advisor's
not my dream job,

but I'm taking a fucking bite
out of the apple.

- Are you?
- Yeah!

Hey, check this out. Check this out.

Liz and I went here... [clears throat]

...last weekend. Amazing.

Amazing. Look at this.

- Lake of the Ozarks?
- Yeah. Lake of the Ozarks.

Southern Missouri,
the redneck Riviera, baby.

Thought I was gonna
hate the place. Got there...

[Bruce makes whooshing sound]

[slurps]

- [gulps] Ah.
- [birds tweeting]

[line ringing]

[Maya] This is Agent Miller.

Hi, uh... this is Mel Sattem.

I'm the private investigator
looking into Marty and Wendy Byrde?

You, uh... You held a gun
on me in their backyard?

How did you get this number?

Like I said, uh... total dick.

[chuckles] Anyways, uh...

I, uh...

I saw you on the news yesterday.

Big fan.

[bugs chirring]

[footsteps approaching]

[Darlene] Darlene Langmore.

Kind of a mouthful.

[Wyatt] I was thinking he should have
both last names, right?

Mm. Ezekiel Langmore-Snell. That's n...

[Javi] You are Darlene Snell.

- Get Zeke.
- No, no, no.

Come in. Sit.

[tense music pulsating]

[Darlene shuddering]

[door closes]

So... [sighs]

...how can we help you today?

We told you from the beginning
to stop selling heroin,

but you just wouldn't listen.

[Darlene] Well, I am sorry about that.

I think maybe if we...

[gunshot]

- [Wyatt whimpers]
- [Javi] Sorry.

Whoever you are.

[gunshot]

[Zeke crying]

[door shuts]

[Zeke wailing]

[Zeke crying frantically]

Wyatt? Darlene?

[Zeke continues wailing]

[music stops]

[tense rhythmic bass pulsating]

[phone buzzing]

Hi! Change your mind
about going away with me?

Why the fuck did you do it?!

I... What are you talking about?

No, don't... don't...
No, don't fuck with me, boy!

I'm gonna shoot your fucking heart out
if you don't... if you don't tell me!

I'm gonna... I'm gonna find you!

- What the hell is the matter with you?
- No, no, why...

Why... Why did you kill my cousin?

Why didn't you just kill Darlene?
Tell me! Tell... Tell me!

[hushed] Hey!

I didn't kill anyone.

No, you're a fucking liar! Tell me why!

Ruth, I didn't do it.

I swear to God...

Ruth?

[suspenseful music pulsing]

- [tires screech]
- [engine revving]

I wonder if the L goes there, but
I like this one because it has a loft.

Yeah, and look at the light.
It looks great.

- Where the fuck is he? Hmm?
- [Marty] You all right?

Where's the man? When you came
last night and said all that fucking shit?

[Wendy] Okay, slow down.
What're you talking about?

- [Marty] Lemme get you water.
- No! No! No!

- [Marty] Hey, what is going on?
- Wyatt.

They killed Wyatt. He's dead. He's dead.

And, and, and, and...

And I... And I know you know who did this.

You... You tell me who he is.
You tell me where he is.

You tell me his name. Tell me!

[Zeke crying]

We don't... We don't know. I'm sorry.

- Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!
- You're a fuckin' liar!

And I'm gonna kill you!

- I'm gonna kill you if you don't tell me!
- Ruth! No, you won't! No, you are not!

- Relax!
- [Wendy] Listen to me. Listen to me.

We don't know anyone
who would want to kill Wyatt.

Maybe the... the KC Mob?

This wasn't the fucking KC Mob,

and they killed Darlene too!

You know anybody else
who might wanna kill her? Huh?!

[screaming] You fucking cunt!

[Wendy] Okay, listen. Listen to me.

I'm sorry this is happening.

You need to calm down.

[Jonah] I'll tell you his name.

[Wendy] No, you will not.

[Ruth sniffling]

His name is Javi Elizondro.

Okay, I'll tell you everything I know.

[Wendy] Okay, look. That man...

That man works for the FBI,

and he runs a drug cartel.

- So even if he is responsible, he is not...
- [Marty] Ruth, Ruth, Ruth.

Do not hurt this man.

[Ruth] Or what?! Your whole
fucking family will be murdered, huh?!

If you want to stop me,

you're gonna have to fucking...

[shrieking]...kill me!

Ruth. Ruth, you can't drive like this!
Not with Zeke in the car.

No, you're gonna step
the fuck back from me,

or I'm gonna take this fuckin' rifle

and blow your fuckin' guts out
all over the fuckin' yard!

Ruth!

Ruth.

I don't care
how many people you send at me.

I'm not fucking laundering.

I don't care. I don't need you to anymore.

Well, I'm pretty fucking busy here.

Okay. Did you get enough, uh, mud on you?

- Just tell me what you fucking want.
- Yeah.

You gotta help me
get my kids back.

Oh, God. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

I'm not.



Javi's mom knows that Navarro
did not kill Javi, and she wants answers.

Unless you help me get my kids back,
I'm gonna tell her exactly what happened.

You're really willing to get me killed.

I didn't shoot Javi.

And why am I responsible for your family?

Because I don't know what else to do.

Wendy has checked herself in to
the same fucking hospital that Ben was in.

Says she's not leaving
until she gets her kids back.

- That's not my business.
- The fuck it isn't.

You killed Javi. You refuse to launder,
and you stole Jonah and made it so that

you might be the only person
he'll actually still listen to.

So it's all your business.

And what if he doesn't listen to me?

I don't know. Fucking kidnap him.



Kill Wendy's dad.
I don't give a fuck what you do,

but if my kids get in that van
and they go to North Carolina,

I'm telling Javi's mom everything.

Is this you? Or Wendy?

Where is Wendy?
Is everything okay?

Uh, yeah, there's...

there's so much work
to be done for the foundation event,

we decided to divide and conquer.

So what is this?

Am I being divided,
or am I being conquered?

And your kids?

- Are they still out of the house?
- Yeah.

So we can speak freely?

Yeah. Yeah, um,

so, uh, these are the numbered accounts.

Uh, they can be accessed directly by you

or by anyone that you need
to pay to facilitate your end.

What about my brother?

Uh, the FBI
has agreed to transfer him,

and... and he won't get any warning.

Um,

Camila, if...
if something were to happen to him

while they were moving him
to the new location,

if he were to try to escape and be killed,

for example...

it would just be considered fate.

I am not putting anything into motion
until I speak with the FBI,

and they will give me
their assurances face-to-face.

That's exactly what
your brother said once.

He was a good boss.

That meeting's being set.

Tell me again about the day my son died.

Uh, there's just
not that much to tell, Camila.

You know, um,

we had that meeting
with Javi in the morning.

It was a good meeting.

Wendy and I did some work
to try to set up that move to Chicago,

and, uh, and then
we had dinner with Clare that night,

went back to the hotel.

Next day, came home, right here.

Are you having second thoughts?

No.

Good.

Individually,
a meerkat may resemble a squirrel,

standing less than one-foot high
and weighing a mere two pounds...

Excuse me, Mrs. Byrde.
You have a visitor.

I had to see what was bullshit
and what wasn't.

- At least you're really here.
- I'm sure that makes you very satisfied.

If I do what I need to do,
that's gotta be enough.

I can't control
whether they stay with you.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Wh...

Marty told me,

if I didn't keep your kids
from going to North Carolina,

he'd tell Javi's mom that I killed him.

Of course that makes you happy.

What do you want from me, Ruth?

I want you to promise

that if I do my part, the rest is on you.

You're their mom.

If they don't wanna be with you,
I can't control that.

So, if I keep my end,
you'll tell Marty to call off narco bitch.

I promise.

Your dad's a real piece of shit,
by the way.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry about yours.

Just how bad is it in here?

Bad.

But it's bearable, right?

Everything's bearable.

You were right.

If I'd have just left him here,

he'd still be alive.

Have Mom and Dad tried
to talk you into going to the gala?

They know
we're leaving beforehand.

Yeah, I just... I just figured,

it's a really big deal,
and you helped make it all possible.

It's okay if part of you
wishes we were going.

I don't wish that.

Hi.

I thought you and I should share a drink,

seeing as how you're leaving tomorrow.

It's a little early, isn't it?

For Ben.

So, what was it about you
that got Ben over the blonde hump, anyway?

Oh, I don't know.

Well, I guess I got lucky.

You know, small town and he didn't
have that many girls to choose from.

I used to get on him
that he liked loose women.

Well, I couldn't condone it.

Didn't blame him, mind you.
Young man, after all.

Right.

And it's pretty hard to get down on a boy,

when his own sister, uh, well...

Hmm.

Nah, trust me. You don't gotta hold
your tongue when it comes to Wendy.

Yeah. Let's just say she had a reputation.

Hmm.

Well, you beat her.

How's that?

You won. You got Jonah and Charlotte.

Right. Yeah, that's right.

And for what it's worth,
every beating I ever got from my daddy,

I knew it was my fault.

We could use more people like you
in the congregation.

These days, it is a much
softer scripture than I remember.

Hmm.

So, uh, did Ben get whupped?

You know, we both know how he was.

Ben embarrassed the family.

It wasn't his fault.
That was just a glitch.

The hard part

is having that one child
that causes you shame.

Hmm.

And, uh, then you look to the other one,
supposed to be better,

and she's even worse.

So, uh...

So tell me,

what are you gonna do when it turns out

Jonah's a mini Marty,
and Charlotte's a little fucking Wendy?

They'll get in line.

And then they'll be gone, right?

- That's the nature of parenting.
- Hmm.

You don't even fucking want them, do you?

- I don't like that kind of language.
- I don't care.

Have I done something to offend you?

No, it's just the truth.

You don't give a flying fuck
about Jonah or Charlotte.

Well, I won't be spoken
to that way by some...

What?

By you.

I'd like you to leave now, please.

I'll leave if you tell me

why you went to court
for kids you don't even fucking want.

How about "fuck her"?

Is that language you can understand?

She was a slut...

...and an embarrassment.

And she deserves
to feel every bit of shame that I felt.

Now you have a blessed fucking day.

What do you think you're doing?

You're gonna tell Jonah and Charlotte
they can't come with you.

I'll do no such thing.

Now,

they're about to be running here,
and when they do,

you're gonna tell them
exactly what you just told me,

or I'll shoot you in your fucking head.

That one.

Grandpa.

What the fuck's going on here?

Anything in your pockets,
in the tray.

Shoes with laces, in the box.

This is messed up. You know that, right?

I know.

So, you know,

just because we're here
does not mean that we're staying.

I-I know. I know.

Just, please.

Um...

When Ruth came by earlier...

...she told me that it was her fault
that Ben was dead.

She said that if she had just
left him in here, he'd still be alive.

And...

I need you to know
how clearly I know she's wrong.

It's my fault.

All of it.

I mean, in the end, I don't know.

I don't know...
I don't know what more I could have done.

I mean, I have thought about it.
I have thought about it a thousand times.

He... he would
have gotten us all killed.

But we... we...
we should never have been there.

And the truth is, Ben is dead...

because I am selfish, and I trapped him.

I knew what our life was.
I knew who he was.

I should never have let him stay.

He was planning to go,

and I asked him to stay
because I wanted him around.

And I wanted to believe
it could all be different.

Actually, even that's bullshit.

I did it because I was mad at your dad.

And by keeping Ben around...

I could prove I was in control.

And

I have been trying
to control the both of you too.

So...

you need to do whatever you're gonna do.

Your dad and I were trying
to build something for all of us,

and I promise
I will not trap you inside it.

I'm not gonna lie

and say I don't want you to stay,
because I do.

I mean, I want you to stay so much
it makes my teeth hurt, but...

...if you want to go...

please...

go.

And I promise you,
I will love you just as much.

How'd it go?

You really didn't have to threaten Ruth.

Well, I'm not saying
that I love you unconditionally,

but we have been through
a shitload of conditions,

and I'm still here.

we just got in

Well, but you're all unharmed.

Well, we're a bit bruised.

We're a little jumpy, but...

...we're okay.

Navarro wants to see you.

Nelson is missing.

He's missing? How?

It's not like him.

Omar is very agitated about it,

and, uh, he knows there are
some messages I just won't deliver.

I think that's why
he's asked me to fetch you.

Yeah, um, not a problem.

I just... I-I gotta...
I gotta run a quick errand first.

I won't be long, okay?

It's not healthy
to be around so much death.

No, we're all...
we're all perfectly okay.

You're...
you're lying to yourself.

You're overreaching.

Again.

How many times

does God have to point
at you before you take notice?

I believe that accident
was your last warning.

Oh, no.

It's an assurance
that we're gonna make it out alive.

Hi.

Yeah?

I need to know if Nelson is
in the bottom of your pool.

God damn it. God damn it!

Look, it... it's not your fucking problem.

It's all my fucking problem, Ruth.
You are always my problem.

Here's the situation.

Navarro knows that Nelson is dead, okay?

Or at least, he's got a pretty good idea.

But the truth is, is that Navarro
is about to be out of the picture. So...

Wait, out of the picture how?

Out... out of the picture
out of the picture. Just let me finish.

Navarro's about to be out of the picture,
not in any position to hit back.

You're gonna be safe.

But I also understand
if you don't trust me,

so if you want, I've got the name of a PI
that can give you a brand-new identity.

You've got money. You could start clean.

I like my name.

Me too.

Uh, are... are you sure Navarro's out?

It's... it's all in the works.
Um, there's... there's one more thing.

We're all gonna meet
with the FBI tomorrow,

and they're gonna need assurances

that they can continue
to launder money out of the casino.

The fucking FBI?

The fucking FBI,

but it... it's not a crime
if they're sanctioning it, okay?

Can you just... can you sit with them
tomorrow and hear them out, please?

I always got time
for my fucking government.

All right.

Um, uh,

Jonah and Charlotte are... are back home.

So, thank you for your help with that.

Yeah, well,

you were gonna have me killed
if I didn't, so...

Anyway...

...they deserve him
less than they deserve you.

Thank you
for coming on such short notice.

- Sounded like an emergency.
- Hmm.

I believe my sister was
behind the attempt on my life.

Why would you think that?

She came to see me.

She began talking about the past.

Reminiscing, so,

she was saying goodbye.

- That could have been anything.
- Well, she's my sister, Wendy. I know her.

What would you like us to do about it?

You will call this number.

He will come from Chicago
and take care of it.

I'm sorry.

Me too.

She is my sister,
and I love her very much.

Did you hear about Nelson?

This is how I knew
that it was Camila, huh?

She orders the first hit,

and then she takes care of Nelson
to prepare for a second try.

The work to get me out. How does it go?

- Good.
- Hmm?

You've laundered enough?

Everyone that needs
to be paid in Mexico will be paid.

The SDN list?

It's all set.

I will need you to step back in, Marty.
Go back to Mexico. ¿Sí?

Of course.

Good.

Don't worry. He believes us.

I don't know, Ruth.

I thought the whole point
was to stop laundering.

Start clean.

Well, it ain't a crime
if you're doing it for the FBI.

You got a whole lot more faith
in those fuckers than I do.

Oh, Cheryl, they're still adding RSVPs.
Think you can bring more tables out?

- Sure. We'll put 'em audience left.
- Great.

Those dickheads are lucky I got
a work ethic as a preexisting condition.

Well,
all we gotta do is hear them out.

Or...

we could get the fuck out of here.

We talked about this.

How long before they find out?

No one's finding that body.

And besides,
Marty says if the deal goes through,

that means Navarro
won't be around to ask questions.

When I...

when I pulled the trigger,

he stared at me
like nothing in the world made sense.

Good. I hope it was fucking painful too.

It wasn't like killing an animal,
you know?

He was a piece of shit.

Still.

He murdered my dad, and he murdered Ben.

I still killed a person.

No, you didn't.

You were never there.

Oh. Hi, there.
Uh, you must be here for the meeting.

Every... everyone is back in the, um...

Good afternoon.

Your group is meeting
back in the parlor. If you, um...

Camila Navarro Elizondro,
this is, uh, Special Agent in Charge Clay,

Executive Assistant Director Graves.

So you're aware...

...Mr. Navarro
is being transferred this evening.

Hiya, Harry.

Why, Ruth.

Well, this meeting is getting,
uh, eclectic.

Hmm. Are all
the swinging dicks already here?

Well, that's not
a characterization I'd offer, but, um...

...yes.

This is Rachel Garrison and Ruth Langmore.

Uh, these are Agents Clay and Graves,
and that is Camila Elizondro.

Uh, Ruth and Rachel are gonna be taking
over operations for the Missouri Belle,

and they're well aware of our mission.

Um,

in fact,
I-I taught Ruth the protocols myself.

Before we start,

I just wanna say
the last FBI agent my partner worked with

fucked her up inside out.

Got her strung out.

So, we'd like an apology
before we agree to sit down

and talk about any of this shit.

On behalf of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

I'd like to apologize
for our treatment of you.

Um, no, thank you. I-I appreciate that.

These are papers
guaranteeing your freedom from prosecution

as a cooperating witness.

Ms. Elizondro,
our agreement will be verbal but binding.

Shall we sit?

No celebrating yet.

Sam, what are you doing?

Well, uh,

moving to North Carolina.

Well, I can see that.

Annalise thinks
it would be a good idea.

Says she can, uh,
teach me how to be grateful.

Hmm.

I'm sure she'll be willing
to teach you a lot of things.

So...

I guess this is...

Fond farewell.

Yeah.

Thanks for always having my back.

Thank you. We'll see you.

Hey, congratulations on Sam.

I mean, you managed to save
at least one lost soul.

What do you want, Wendy?

- I-I'm not... I'm not here to fight.
- Then what?

Our foundation has made
a very generous donation

to the site dedicated to finding Ben.

There is a healthy stipend

in perpetuity until he's found.

I'd like you to be in charge.

You can afford to continue your work.

Or any other work you see fit.

Goodbye, Wendy.

Safe trip.

You get everything you wanted.

Get to be the grieving father.

You have money.
You have status in your church.

You just don't get to hurt me.

I suppose you're proud of yourself.

Not at all.

Hi.

Hi.

Hey.

Oh, Charlotte, you look beautiful.

Turn around.

Hey, Mom.

Hi.

I'll... I'll get dressed.

Excuse me.

Nice turnout.

Congratulations.

Has anyone backed out?

Oh, not only has no one backed out,
we're still fielding requests.

This whole place
smells like freshly minted money.

Are most of the late additions local?

A few, um, but you've also got

this serious Rust Belt wave happening.

Well, tease me some names,
just for a high.

Uh, DeGroot, Bedwell, Militti, Findley.

So we're bulletproof.

It's a goddamn coronation.

Is Schafer here?

Yeah, he's downstairs trying his luck
at the blackjack tables.

May I borrow you a sec?

You're gonna wanna make a quiet exit.

What are you talking about?

We've instructed our people
in Michigan and Wisconsin

to pull your voting machines.

You can't do that.

It's done.

No, you need me on this board

if you want your foundation
not to die on the fucking vine.

Please, Randall.
Have you looked upstairs?

Oh, you should also know, we've talked
to our very good friends at the FBI.

Our first anti-corruption partnership.

That's just blowback on you, Wendy Byrde.

Oh, we're way ahead of you there.

"Change starts at home."

"Cleaning up our own house."
Yada yada yada.

You know the drill.

You don't wanna do this.

Oh, but I do.

Without me, you don't stand a chance
of getting anyone off the SDN list.

I'm well aware.

Up.

The hell is going on?

You're being transferred.

Transferred where?

Transferred.

Gimme your hands.

Where are you taking me?

Let's go.

Tell me where you're taking me.

- This is for you.
- Thanks.

- All set?
- Mm.

Are you gonna miss it?

I'll miss the caves.

And the, uh, the crickets maybe.

And I'll miss being close to Buddy.

Are you gonna miss anything?

If I'm being honest...

I just can't believe it's over.

When we get back to Chicago,

will you go to Portillo's with me
for chocolate cake shakes?

Do you really need to ask me that?

Uh, Jack, I'm gonna need
a couple more limes for Jenny.

Now, Jonah. God damn.

You look like
a grown-ass man in that suit.

You know, there's always
a job for you here if you want it.

I'm actually thinking of going legit.

- Hmm.
- At least until I get through high school.

Here you go, Ruth.

Well, that sounds like a plan.

You decided where
you're gonna live in Chicago?

Well, we were talking about
the northern suburbs, but I think...

- She's talking about northern...
- There you are.

- Hey.
- Congratulations are in order?

- Oh, yeah. Cheers.
- To all of us. Yeah.

This is impressive.

- Hmm.
- It's just the beginning.

I'm glad you're here.

I've been thinking more and more
about the day my son died.

Trying to make sense of it.

Is there anything you can remember
about that day that seemed odd?

There's nothing I can think of.

The reason I ask is

that day in your office,
when I brought up my son,

you seemed to get nervous.

Did I?

Well, I wouldn't know why.

You met him that afternoon, yes?

Uh, the morning.

He called me that night, and he said
he had made a deal for the stock options.

That's right.
I needed some time to think about it,

and... and we spoke
on the phone that night.

Where were you that night?

I had dinner with Marty and Wendy,
and then I went home.

So you called him after your dinner?

That's right.

'Cause he made it seem
as if he was going to see you.

No, no, it was much too late.

You're saying he was lying?

Of course not. It just
sounds like it was a miscommunication.

Right.

Hear me very clearly.

I'm about to take over for my brother.
You know our business.

I suppose
this must be frightening for you.

If you know something
about the day my son died

that you haven't told me,

I will forgive you this one time.

If I find out later that there's
something you aren't telling me now,

well...

I'll have someone slash you
from your cunt to your chin.

It was Ruth Langmore.

The girl here? In the casino?

Javi killed her cousin.

She followed him to my office,
and she shot him.

I'm sorry.

I didn't know what to do. I had my...

I had my head of security
take care of the body.

- I am so sorry.
- Did you know?

- I didn't tell anyone.
- Of course not.

I was terrified. I was...

I was sure I would be killed.

You're close to that girl.

You see that blonde in the bar?

If you warn her,

if I even sense someone's following me...

I'll kill all of you.

Now...

do you see those kids?

If their parents even cross eyes
with the blonde...

I'm sorry.

- What the fuck are we supposed to do?
- I don't know.

Okay.

Okay, okay, we can fix this.

We can fix this.
We have the number of Navarro's hit man.

We can call the hit on Camila.

Not gonna matter. They're moving
Navarro tonight. He's not gonna survive.

Okay, so we... we call the FBI.
We ask them to cancel the transfer.

Okay, and then what?

We've got no way to get Navarro
off the SDN list 'cause we lost Schafer.

Marty.

You really need me to say it?

Anything we try to do,
Wendy, is gonna be suicide.

There you are. People are asking for you.

Yeah.

- Thanks. I'll be right back.
- Here you go.

I think I'm gonna get out of here before
people start making fucking speeches.

You are not finishing my cold pizza,
or I'll hate you forever.

You got it.

Drive safe.

Thank you so much. Yeah, yeah.

- I lost him. Do you see him?
- Just look at me. Look at me.

Talk to me.

I'm scared I'll lose you.

You won't. You won't.

What if this is too much to bear?

It won't be.

Where are we going?

Gotta take a piss.

Take one for me.

Come here. Come here.

There's a car half a mile up the road.

It will take you to a plane.

Let's go.

Good.

This is Officer Silva.

Hello.

How'd you find out?

Clare Shaw told me.

I'm not sorry.

Your son was a murdering bitch.

And now I know where he got it from.

Well, are you gonna fucking
do this shit or what?

- I love you.
- I love you.

Marty.

I apologize for breaking in.

I, uh, just had to find my boy here.

But FYI, once I got him,
I came right back outside.

I didn't wanna be intrusive.

Big night, huh?

What do you want?

I couldn't do my job.

Everything I've been dreaming about
for four years,

back on the force, Chicago PD,

all I could think about was you people.

And then I started thinking...

about this guy.

I mean, who doesn't ever
fill a cookie jar? What's with that?

And then why give it to a kid?

Except, well, wait.

That kid loved your brother.

Your brother wanted to run away,
raise goats, so I sort of got, uh...

crazy obsessed with finding out
what's inside this cookie jar, you know?

If it's not cookies.

You know what the answer is?

Evidence.

DNA. I mean we're talking
chunks, bone, maybe even teeth.

Oh, that must be one seriously
old-ass crematorium you guys have.

- We can pay you.
- Anything you want.

I don't want your money.

Name your price.

You can change your life.
You can change anyone's life you want.

Except your money's toxic.

But it... it won't be ours.
It... it'll be yours.

Money doesn't know where it came from.

You don't get it, do you?

You don't get to win.

You don't get to be
the Kochs or the Kennedys

or whatever fucking royalty
you people think you are.

World doesn't work like that.
